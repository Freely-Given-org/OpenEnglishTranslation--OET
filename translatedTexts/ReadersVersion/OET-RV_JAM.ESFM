\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip The author of this letter is commonly known as ‘James’ in English translations, but most people don't realise that his English name should be Jacob (or Yakōbos if you wanted to be closer to the Koine Greek spelling). This translation error can be traced all the way back to John Wycliffe's English translation from the Latin in the 1300's as he didn't have access to Greek New Testament manuscripts (although he did use Yacob in some parts of his New Testament when it referred to the son of Isaac). The confusion was probably due to changes in the way Latin was spoken over the centuries, and then translating the name from the historically-altered Latin instead of from the original Greek—see https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/bible-versions-and-translations/james-or-jacob-in-the-bible for more details.
\ip Note from the first sentence in the letter that Yacob addressed the letter to the twelve tribes who originated from the twelve sons of his namesake.
\is2 This letter
\ip This \bk Letter from Yacob\bk* is Yacob's collection of advice to those who believe there is a god in heaven. He wrote this to all people scattered all around the world. Yacob used examples in order to explain his advice, so that their behaviour would improve and also their daily work. He also taught on various topics like: faith, testing, suffering, showing, respect, good behaviour, watching what you say, true wisdom from God, and prayer.
\ip He said that our faith is deficient if we don't also demonstrate it by our actions.

\rem /s1 Faith under trial
\p
\v 2 Be cheerful¦146474 my¦146477 fellow¦146476 believers¦146476, when you¦146480 face a range¦146481 of difficult situations,
\v 3 knowing¦146483 that you¦146487 will learn endurance¦146491 as your¦146487 faith¦146489 is tested.
\v 4 Let that endurance¦146494 do its¦146496 perfect work so that you¦146499 all might become perfect and¦146501 mature—not lacking¦146505 anything.
\p
\v 5 If anyone¦146508 of you is lacking¦146510 wisdom¦146511, then it should¦146512 be requested¦146512 from \nd God¦146518\nd* who gives it generously¦146520 and without disparagement, and so it will be given¦146526 to you,
\v 6 but¦146529 the person who's asking should¦146528 demonstrate their faith¦146531 and not be doubting. That's because¦146535 a person who doubts is like a wave on the sea¦146539 that's just blown¦146540 and tossed¦146542 around
\v 7 and a person¦146547 like that shouldn't¦146543 expect to get anything¦146551 from the \nd master¦146555\nd*
\rem /s1 Poverty and Riches
\v 8 because that person is double-minded, and everything they attempt ends up in difficulty.
\s1 Behaviour of the poor and the wealthy
\p
\v 9 Those of humbler¦146569 means can boast¦146564 about their greatness
\v 10 whereas the wealthy¦146576 can boast about their weakness because¦146582 they'll pass away just like the daisies in the grass¦146585.\x + \xo 1:10-11: \xt Isa 40:6-7 (LXX).\x*
\v 11 When the sun¦146590 rises with its¦146601 scorching¦146593 heat and withers¦146595 the grass¦146597, the flowers¦146600 will drop and lose all their beauty¦146605. So too for rich people who'll fade away right in the middle of all their projects.
\s1 Testing and temptation
\rem /s1 Trial and Temptation
\rem /s1 Testing and Tempting
\p
\v 12 Any person who's enduring¦146624 testing circumstances is fortunate, because¦146627 once they've passed the test, they'll receive¦146630 a crown¦146632 of life¦146634 that Yeshua promised¦146636 to those who love him¦146641.
\v 13 No one should¦146644 say ‘It's God tempting me’ when they're being tempted, because¦146652 God can't be tempted to do evil¦146656 and he doesn't tempt others,
\v 14 but¦146662 rather they're being tempted¦146663 by their own lusts. They're being drawn¦146668 away and¦146669 enticed¦146670 \add into what they know is wrong\add*,
\v 15 and after the desire¦146673 is conceived¦146674 it leads to sin, and once the sin is concluded it leads to death¦146682.
\p
\v 16 Don't be led astray, my¦146686 dear brothers¦146685 and¦146685 sisters¦146685.
\v 17 Every¦146688 gift¦146693 that's good¦146690 and¦146691 perfect¦146694 comes from heaven. It comes down from the father¦146701 of lights¦146703, none of which are changing or casting moving shadows¦146713.
\v 18 Once he had decided it, he created us by his spoken commands so that we'd become a kind of special first¦146724 ‘harvest’ out of all of his creatures.
\s1 Listening then doing
\rem /s1 Hearing and Doing
\rem /s1 Hearing and Doing the Word
\rem /s1 Listening and Doing
\p
\v 19 So my¦146735 dear brothers¦146734 and sisters¦146734, note this: Everyone should be quick¦146743 to listen¦146746 but¦146740 slow to speak¦146750, and should be slow to get angry
\v 20 because¦146755 when people get very angry, it doesn't lead to the good behaviour that \nd God¦146758\nd* expects.
\v 21 So¦146762 discard all \add moral\add* filth¦146765 and the evil¦146769 that's plentiful, and humbly accept the message¦146776 that's implanted¦146775 in you¦146782 all and which is capable of saving your¦146782 souls¦146781.
\p
\v 22 Don't delude¦146792 yourselves¦146793 by just listening¦146790 to the message¦146786, but put it into practice \add in your daily lives\add*.
\v 23 Anyone who is just a listener¦146797 of the message¦146798 and¦146800 does nothing with it is like someone who looks at their face¦146809 in a mirror¦146814
\v 24 but goes away after having a look and then immediately¦146821 forgets what they looked like.
\v 25 However the person who investigates¦146827 the perfect¦146830 law that gives freedom¦146833, and then sticks with it, not being just an observer that forgets¦146839 about it but¦146826 rather a person who puts it into practice, this person will prosper in whatever they do.
\p
\v 26 If anyone¦146853 supposes¦146854 that they're religious but¦146865 doesn't guard what comes out of their mouth, then that person's religion is only skin deep and hasn't affected their heart¦146867.
\v 27 A person who wants to truly serve our¦146881 \nd God¦146882\nd* and father¦146885 with a pure heart would be visiting¦146888 orphans¦146889 and widows¦146891 in their¦146895 difficulties and staying unstained by worldly¦146903 ideas.

\rem /s1 Warning against Prejudice
\rem /s1 Love your neighbour as yourself
\p
\v 1 My¦146905 dear brothers¦146904 and¦146904 sisters¦146904, as you live out your faith¦146911 in our¦146914 honoured \nd master¦146913 Yeshua¦146915\nd* the \nd messiah¦146916\nd*, don't¦146906 show favouritism¦146908 to others.
\v 2 For \add example\add*, if a man in nicely cut clothes and wearing an expensive gold¦146927 ring came into to your¦146925 meeting as well as a poor man in filthy¦146936 clothes
\v 3 and you told the well-dressed one, ‘You sit here in this good¦146954 chair,’ while telling the poor man, ‘You stand¦146960 over here,’ or ‘You sit here on the mat,’
\v 4 wouldn't that discrimination show that you¦146976 have judged¦146981 them with evil¦146983 motives.
\v 5 Listen my¦146986 dear brothers¦146985 and sisters¦146985, didn't¦146988 \nd God¦146990\nd* chose¦146991 the poor in this world¦146996 to be rich in faith¦147001 and participants in the kingdom¦147006 which¦147007 he promises¦147008 to those who love him?
\v 6 But you dishonour¦147014 the poor, even though it's the wealthier people who oppress¦147021 you and bring court¦147029 cases against you.
\v 7 And aren't they¦147032 the ones who slander¦147033 the very God that¦147037 you¦147040 pray to?
\s1 Judgement and mercy
\p
\v 8 However if you are obeying the golden law, then when you love your¦147053 neighbour¦147052 as yourself¦147055,\x + \xo 2:8: \xt Lev 19:18.\x* you'll be doing¦147061 well according¦147047 to the scriptures¦147049.
\v 9 But if you're showing¦147064 favouritism¦147064, then you're all sinning by breaking the law.
\v 10 Because¦147075 anyone¦147087 who tries to keep¦147080 the law but¦147085 slips up in one area, they're still guilty of breaking the law.
\v 11 The same \add God\add* who said, ‘Don't commit adultery,’ also said, ‘Don't murder,’\x + \xo 2:11: a \xt Exo 20:14; Deu 5:18; \xo b \xt Exo 20:13; Deu 5:17.\x* so if you're¦147107 not committing adultery but you murder someone, then¦147105 you've broken the law.
\v 12 So speak¦147118 and¦147119 live your life knowing that you're going¦147126 to be judged¦147127 by the law that gives freedom¦147125,
\v 13 because¦147129 judgement will be dispensed without mercy to those who haven't been putting mercy into practice. Yes, mercy wins out over judgement.

\p
\v 14 My¦147147 fellow¦147146 believers¦147146, what would I gain if I said that someone had faith but it didn't¦147156 alter how they live their life? Faith like that wouldn't be able to save them.
\v 15 If a fellow believer is lacking¦147174 clothes or food,
\v 16 and one of you says to them, ‘Go in peace¦147191 and be warm and satisfied¦147195,’ but don't¦147197 help with their¦147203 physical needs, what use would that be?
\v 17 In other words, faith¦147211 without the corresponding lifestyle is just dead¦147217.
\p
\v 18 No doubt someone¦147223 will say, ‘Well you have the faith and I do the good deeds.’ So show me your¦147236 faith without¦147237 good deeds and I'll demonstrate my faith \em by\em* my good deeds.
\v 19 You believe that there's one \nd God¦147261\nd* and you're¦147264 right, but even the demons¦147267 believe that and shudder¦147270.
\v 20 But the vain person¦147275 still wants to know¦147273 if faith¦147279 without good deeds is wasted?
\v 21 Wasn't our¦147289 ancestor Abraham considered right with God due to his \em actions\em* when he offered¦147294 up his son Isaac¦147295 on the altar¦147301?\x + \xo 2:21: \xt Gen 22:1-14.\x*
\v 22 So his faith was working¦147306 together¦147306 with his actions, and it was by his actions that his faith was perfected¦147317.
\v 23 This fulfilled¦147319 the scripture¦147321 that¦147322 says, ‘Abraham¦147326 believed¦147324 in God and so he was consider to be right¦147333 with God, and was called¦147337 a friend¦147335 of God.’\x + \xo 2:23: a \xt Gen 15:6; \xo b \xt 2Ch 20:7; Isa 41:8.\x*
\v 24 So you can see that a person¦147345 is considered right with God due to his actions, and¦147346 not just by their ‘faith¦147349’.
\v 25 Similarly the prostitute¦147357 Rahab¦147355 was made right by her actions when she welcomed¦147362 the \add Hebrew\add* messengers¦147365 and¦147366 then¦147353 helped them get away by a different route.\x + \xo 2:25: \xt Josh 2:1-21.\x*
\v 26 Just like a body¦147373 is dead once the spirit¦147375 has departed, so too faith¦147381 is dead if it's not demonstrated by good deeds.

\v 1 My¦147392 brothers¦147391 and¦147391 sisters¦147391, not everyone should desire to be a teacher because we¦147397 know that us teachers¦147389 will be judged¦147396 more strictly.
\v 2 We all stumble in many ways¦147398. If there was someone who never said anything wrong, this person would be perfect¦147409 and also able to have self-control over their entire¦147401 body¦147417.
\v 3 With horses¦147424, we can put the bridle¦147426 in it's mouth¦147430 so we can make them do what we want, and¦147421 so we can direct¦147445 the whole animal.
\v 4 Similarly, even huge¦147452 ships¦147450 that are being driven¦147459 on by strong winds¦147457 are controlled by a small rudder¦147463 and¦147454 can be steered wherever¦147464 the captain desires.
\v 5 So too the tongue¦147476 is only small¦147477 but can make extensive claims.
\p Yes, a tiny flame can ignite an entire forest¦147489
\v 6 and the tongue is a fire producing a torrent of depravity. It's a part of our physical body¦147513 but capable of staining¦147510 us all over and setting¦147515 our worlds¦147496 on fire, because the tongue itself is set on fire from hell.
\v 7 Every kind of wild animal and birds¦147532 and reptiles¦147533 and sea¦147536 creature¦147536 can be tamed and has been tamed by humankind¦147545
\v 8 but¦147548 no one is able to tame the tongue¦147549—it's an erratically evil¦147558 body part that's full of deadly¦147561 poison¦147560.
\v 9 We use it to bless¦147564 \add &our\add* \nd master¦147566\nd* and father¦147569, yet we use it to curse our fellow humans who are made in God's image.\x + \xo 3:9: \xt Gen 1:26.\x*
\v 10 Both blessings¦147587 and curses¦147589 come out of the same¦147584 mouth¦147585! My¦147593 brothers¦147592 and sisters¦147592, it shouldn't be like that.
\v 11 Surely¦147597 a spring¦147601 flowing out of a single cavity can't¦147597 produce both good-tasting and¦147609 bitter¦147611 \add water\add*.
\v 12 A fig¦147616 tree¦147616 can't produce olives¦147618 and a grape vine¦147621 can't produce figs¦147622, my¦147615 brothers¦147614 and sisters¦147614, just like a salty supply can't give fresh water¦147632.

\v 2 You all have wants that are not fulfilled so it leads to murder¦147756. You're jealous¦147758 and not able to get everything you want, so you quarrel¦147763 and fight. You don't¦147754 have, because¦147770 you haven't asked \add God\add*,

\v 4 You're just like prostitutes. Don't you realise that if you befriend the world then you're opposing God, so anyone who befriends the world makes themself an enemy¦147818 of God.
\v 5 Do you¦147823 think that¦147835 the scripture¦147828 means nothing when it says, ‘\add God's\add* \nd spirit¦147834\nd* jealously longs to live in us’?

\v 7 So¦148158 my fellow¦148159 believers¦148159, be patient until the return of \add Yeshua our\add* \nd master¦148164\nd*. You see how farmers¦148167 look forward to the fruit¦148171 to be ready—waiting patiently even while they monitor the early¦148184 and¦148185 the late rains¦148186.
\v 8 All of you should be patient¦148187 too, and encourage each other \add in your¦148194 faith\add* because¦148195 the \nd master's¦148199\nd* return is closer now.
\p
\v 9 And don't¦148209 moan about each other, my fellow¦148203 believers¦148203, so that you¦148210 all won't¦148209 be judged¦148210 for it, because truly, the judge¦148214 is just outside about to come in the doors¦148217.
\v 10 Look at the prophets¦148233 who spoke¦148235 out the messages from \nd Yahweh¦148239\nd*—they're good examples¦148219 of suffering and¦148228 patience¦148230 \add for you to follow\add*
\v 11 and now we consider them as heroes for their endurance. You all heard¦148248 about Yob's endurance and then you yourselves witnessed what happened to \add Yeshua our\add* master,\x + \xo 5:11: a \xt Yob 1:21-22; 2:10; \xo b \xt Psa 103:8.\x* and you saw his compassion and mercy.
\p
\v 12 But most importantly, brothers¦148265 and sisters¦148265, don't¦148267 swear¦148268 by heaven¦148271 or earth¦148274 or by any other¦148276 kind of oath but simply be honest so that ‘yes’ means yes and ‘no’ means no,\x + \xo 5:12: \xt Mat 5:34-37.\x* then you won't¦148267 end up getting judged¦148296.

\rem /s1 The Power of Prayer
\p
\v 13 Is anyone among¦148300 you¦148301 going through hard times? If so, they should be praying¦148302. Is anyone feeling cheerful¦148303? If so, they should be singing¦148307 praises¦148307.
\v 14 Is anyone¦148309 among¦148311 you¦148312 sick? If so, that person should¦148313 call the leaders \add of the assembly¦148317\add* and get them to anoint¦148323 them with oil and to pray for them\x + \xo 5:14: \xt Mrk 6:13.\x* in the name¦148328 and authority of \add Yeshua\add* \add &our\add* \nd master¦148330\nd*.
\v 15 Then¦148331 that declaration of faith¦148335 will save the weak person and the \nd master¦148343\nd* will lift him/her up, and if they've sinned, then¦148331 their sins¦148345 will also be forgiven¦148348.
\v 16 So¦148351 confess¦148350 your¦148353 sins¦148355 to each other and¦148357 pray for each other so that all of you¦148363 can be healed¦148363, because when an obedient believer prays, it has a real effect.
\v 17 Eliyah was a person just similar to us, and when he prayed¦148375 for the rain to stop, it stopped, and it didn't¦148378 rain again for three¦148388 and a half years¦148386.\x + \xo 5:17: \xt 1Ki 17:1; 18:1.\x*
\v 18 Then¦148392 he prayed¦148394 again, and the rain came down from the sky¦148397 and the land sprouted¦148405 and started to bear fruit¦148407 again.\x + \xo 5:18: \xt 1Ki 18:42-45.\x*
\rem /s1 Restore Wandering Believers
\p
\v 19 My¦148410 fellow¦148409 believers¦148409, if any of you¦148414 have wandered from the truth¦148420 and¦148421 someone¦148423 helps them back,
\v 20 then you should know that someone who helps a sinner¦148430 to come back from their deceitful ways will be saving¦148435 their soul¦148437 from death¦148440,\x + \xo 5:20: \xt Prv 10:12; 1Pe 4:8.\x* and¦148442 their many sins¦148445 can be forgiven.
