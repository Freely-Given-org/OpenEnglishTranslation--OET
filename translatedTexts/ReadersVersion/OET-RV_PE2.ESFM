\mt2 The first letter from
\mt1 Simon ‘the Rock’ (Peter)
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk The second letter from Simon ‘Peter’\bk* was sent to believers in various towns of Asia Minor (also called Anatolia, now part of modern Turkey) (1 Peter 1:1, 2 Peter 3:1). His purpose of writing this was to contradict the work of false teachers, and to scold the people for their bad behaviour as a result of following that teaching. Therefore he encouraged them to not believe that teaching because they should only believe the teaching concerning the messiah. They also need to be adding the following to their faith: good behaviour, wisdom/knowledge, self-control, patience, obeying God, and loving others.
\ip Those people taught that the messiah would not return since it had already been quite a while and he hadn't yet returned. But Simon answered by saying that the messiah would certainly return, but God doesn't want to punish everyone, but desires that people would turn away from their sins.

\rem /s1 Salutation; Greetings from Peter
\p
\v 1 This \add letter is from\add* Simon¦151463 Peter (Grk: Simeon Petros¦151465), a slave¦151466 and messenger of Yeshua the \nd messiah¦151470\nd* (Grk: Yesou Christos), writing to those who have faith in the sinlessness of our \nd God¦151482\nd* and saviour¦151485 Yeshua \nd Messiah¦151470\nd* that's just as precious as our faith.
\p
\v 2 May you¦151490 experience much grace¦151489 and peace¦151492 through your knowledge¦151495 of \nd God¦151497\nd* and \nd Yeshua¦151499\nd* our¦151503 Lord.
\s1 God's calling

\p
\v 3 He has given us everything necessary for life¦151518 and godliness through¦151522 his divine¦151510 power¦151511 as we know¦151524 the one who called¦151526 us to his own glory¦151530 and moral excellence.
\v 4 Through these¦151551 things, he has given us precious¦151538 and very great¦151542 promises¦151546 that you will become¦151552 participants of the divine¦151553 nature¦151555 after escaping¦151557 the corruption¦151568 in the world¦151562 of lust.
\v 5 For this same¦151571 reason, work hard to apply your¦151584 faith¦151583 adding moral excellence, and to that excellence add knowledge¦151592;
\v 6 to that knowledge¦151596 add self-control; to that self-control add endurance; to that endurance add godliness;
\v 7 to that godliness add brotherly concern; and to the brotherly concern add selfless love.
\v 8 Because¦151625 if these¦151624 things are part of you¦151626 and¦151629 continually increasing, your knowledge¦151644 of our¦151641 Lord \nd \nd Yeshua¦151642\nd* Messiah¦151643\nd* won't become useless or unproductive.
\v 9 But if these¦151649 things aren't part of someone, that person is shortsighted as if they've forgotten that prior cleansing of their sins¦151661.
\p
\v 10 So¦151662 then fellow Christians, work hard to make your¦151673 calling¦151676 and election certain—that way you will never fall away—
\v 11 and so you¦151692 will be richly¦151690 provided entry into the eternal¦151698 kingdom¦151700 of our¦151703 Lord and saviour¦151705 \nd \nd Yeshua¦151707\nd* Messiah¦151708\nd*.
\rem /s1 Paying Attention to Scripture; Prophecy of Scripture
\p
\v 12 Therefore¦151709 I intend to always¦151715 remind¦151717 you about these¦151719 things, even though you know them and are already established in the truth¦151730 that you know.
\v 13 But¦151732 I consider¦151733 it¦151733 right¦151731, as long¦151735 as I live in this tent, to get you¦151742 stirred up with a reminder,
\v 14 since I know that this tent of mine will soon be left behind as our¦151760 Lord \nd \nd Yeshua¦151761\nd* Messiah¦151762\nd* himself told me.
\v 15 And I will also make every effort to make sure that you¦151770 will always remember¦151777 these¦151776 things after¦151771 my departure¦151774.
\rem /s1 Eyewitnesses of Christ's Glory
\p
\v 16 We didn't follow¦151783 cleverly¦151781 crafted fables, but¦151795 rather having been eyewitnesses¦151796 of the majesty of our¦151789 Lord \nd \nd Yeshua¦151790\nd* Messiah¦151791\nd*, we¦151784 made his power¦151792 and¦151793 forthcoming return known¦151784 to you¦151785.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17-18: \xt Mat 17:1-5; Mrk 9:2-7; Luk 9:28-35.\x*Because¦151803 he received¦151802 the honour¦151808 and glory from \nd God¦151806\nd* the Father when a voice¦151811 spoke to him with magnificent glory saying, “This is my¦151824 son that I dearly love and who has pleased¦151833 me greatly.”
\v 18 Indeed we heard¦151840 this voice¦151838 from heaven¦151843 ourselves as we had been taken with him¦151847 to the holy mountain¦151854.
\p
\v 19 In addition there are the words of the prophets¦151859 that were fulfilled which you would do well to pay attention to—like a light that shines in the dark places¦151870—until¦151871 the day¦151874 dawns and the one who is the morning¦151877 star¦151877 rises in your¦151882 hearts¦151881.
\v 20 And know this foundational truth: all of the prophecy¦151888 in Scripture doesn't just come from our own interpretations¦151893
\v 21 or from the ideas of man, but¦151905 from \nd God¦151915\nd* speaking via men being¦151909 guided by the Holy Spirit.

\s1 False teachers
\rem /s1 God's judgement on false teaching; The Danger of False Teachers; False Teachers; False Teachers and Their Destruction; False Prophets and Their Punishment
\p
\v 1 But just like there were also false prophets¦151921 among the people¦151924, so also there will be false teachers¦151930 among you¦151928 who will sneakily¦151932 bring in destructive heresies—even denying the Master¦151939 and thus bringing¦151941 swift destruction upon themselves¦151943.
\v 2 Many people will follow¦151948 their¦151949 gross immorality causing evil to be spoken of about the true way¦151957.
\v 3 They will exploit you¦151966 with greed¦151963 and made-up words but the judgment¦151973 of old won't be idle and their¦151981 destroyer¦151980 won't be sleeping.
\p
\v 4 Because¦151986 if \nd God¦151988\nd* didn't spare¦151992 the messengers¦151989 when they sinned¦151990, but¦151993 chained them in darkness¦151996 and kept¦152002 them to be delivered to judgement in due course,
\v 5 \x + \xo 2:5: \xt Gen 6:1–7:24.\x*and if he didn't spare¦152010 the ancient¦152007 world but only preserved¦152016 the eight¦152012 including \nd Noah¦152013\nd* the proclaimer¦152015 of righteousness¦152014 when the flood¦152017 came upon the ungodly¦152020 world,
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6: \xt Gen 19:24.\x*and if he reduced¦152028 the cities¦152023 of Sodom¦152024 and Gomorrah¦152026 to ashes¦152028 by a catastrophe which condemned¦152030 them to being an example¦152031 of what the ungodly¦152036 will become,
\v 7 \x + \xo 2:7: \xt Gen 19:1-16.\x*and if he saved the righteous¦152040 man Lot¦152041 who was distressed¦152042 by the gross immorality of the lawless¦152047 people
\v 8 and whose righteous soul was tormented¦152069 by seeing¦152053 and hearing¦152056 their lawlessness¦152067 day after day,
\v 9 then the Lord knows how to rescue¦152076 godly¦152072 people from their trials, and knows how to keep the unrighteous¦152078 people to be punished¦152085 at the day¦152083 of judgement,
\v 10 especially those who follow their fleshly¦152091 lusts¦152093 that defile¦152096 themselves and despise¦152100 his Lordship.
\p Those bold, self-willed¦152103 people don't¦152106 worry about insulting¦152108 the glorious¦152104 ones,
\v 11 whereas¦152109 even messengers¦152110 who are greater¦152115 in both strength¦152111 and¦152112 power¦152113 don't¦152117 slander¦152124 or pass the Lord's judgement on those glorious ones.
\v 12 But these¦152126 men act like unthinking animals¦152131 that are born to be captured¦152137 and destroyed when they slander¦152144 concerning things they know nothing about, and they will bring about their¦152149 own destruction.
\v 13 The harm they did will lead to their own harm as payment as their indulgence in broad daylight. They've become spots and¦152168 blemishes¦152169 as they feast¦152177 together with you¦152178 yet take joy in their deception.
\v 14 Their eyes¦152179 are full of lust for adultery¦152182 and never cease to sin¦152186, and having trained¦152192 their hearts¦152191 in greed¦152193 they entice¦152188 unstable¦152190 people to become their cursed¦152196 offspring.
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15-16: \xt Num 22:4-35.\x*They have left the right path and gone astray, following¦152203 the path of Balaam the son of Bosor¦152209 who loved¦152214 the wages of unrighteousness¦152213,
\v 16 but he was scolded for his sin when a normally dumb donkey¦152221 spoke¦152227 to him with a man's voice¦152226 to stop his madness.
\p
\v 17 These¦152233 men are like waterless¦152236 fountains and like mists¦152238 driven¦152242 by storms¦152241, and the gloomy darkness is reserved for them
\v 18 because¦152252 they¦152256 speak¦152255 vane and inflated words to entice¦152256 people to fleshly¦152259 lusts¦152258. Those who have just escaped¦152265 from the errors of their living
\v 19 are promised¦152275 freedom¦152273, but they themselves have become slaves¦152277 to corruption¦152281, because¦152283 whatever a person has been defeated by is what they become a slave to.
\v 20 Because¦152290 if they have escaped¦152291 the defilements¦152293 of the world¦152295 by their knowledge¦152297 of our Lord and saviour¦152302 \nd \nd Yeshua¦152303\nd* Messiah¦152304\nd* and yet get entangled¦152308 again¦152307, they are defeated and have ended up worse¦152315 off than at the beginning.
\v 21 It would have been better¦152318 not to have known the way of righteousness¦152330, than having known it and to turn back from the holy instruction that was passed on to them.
\v 22 \x + \xo 2:22: \xt Prv 26:11.\x*The proverb¦152353 is correct in what it says and has happened¦152346 to them: “A dog returns¦152355 to its¦152357 own vomit¦152359,” and “A sow that's been washed¦152362 wallows¦152364 in the mud again.”

\p
\v 1 This is now my second¦152370 letter¦152373 to you my friends—both of which¦152375 were sent as reminders to stir up your¦152377 minds to sincerely¦152382
\v 2 remember the messages¦152387 spoken¦152386 in the past by the holy prophets¦152391 as well as the instruction of the Lord and saviour¦152402 that came via your¦152396 apostles.
\v 3 \x + \xo 3:3: \xt Jude 18.\x*Firstly you should know that mockers¦152418 will come during the last days¦152415, scoffing, following their¦152420 own lusts¦152423
\v 4 and¦152426 saying¦152427, “What about his¦152434 promised¦152431 return? Everything has just continued¦152443 as usual from the beginning¦152445 of creation¦152446 right past the time¦152436 when the ancestors¦152439 died.
\v 5 \x + \xo 3:5: \xt Gen 1:6-9.\x*But because¦152448 of their desires, the truth is hidden from them that the universe came into being long ago by God's spoken command and the earth¦152458 was formed out of water and through¦152462 water
\v 6 \x + \xo 3:6: \xt Gen 7:11.\x*and these same waters¦152477 deluged the ancient world¦152476 which¦152472 then perished¦152479.
\v 7 But the present universe and the earth¦152486 have been preserved by that same¦152489 command, to be kept¦152495 for fire¦152494 in the day¦152497 of judgement and destruction¦152501 of those who are ungodly¦152503.
\p
\v 8 \x + \xo 3:8: \xt Psa 90:4.\x*But don't¦152508 let this one thing escape¦152509 your attention my dear friends, that one day for us is like a thousand years with the Lord, and a thousand years is like one day.
\v 9 The Lord isn't slow in fulfilling his promise¦152533 as some consider¦152537 slowness¦152536, but is patient¦152539 toward¦152541 you¦152542—not wanting anyone to perish¦152548 but rather wanting everyone to come to repentance¦152553.
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10: \xt Mat 24:43; Luk 12:39; 1Th 5:2; Rev 16:15.\x*But the day¦152558 of the Lord will come like a thief¦152561, when the universe will suddenly pass away, its components will burn up and be destroyed¦152574, and the earth¦152578 and what happened on it¦152582 will be examined.
\v 11 Since all these¦152589 things will be destroyed¦152595, what kind of people¦152596 should you¦152599 be? Holy and¦152605 godly in conduct¦152604,

\v 15 And consider¦152670 the patience¦152668 of our Lord as leading to salvation¦152669 as our dear brother¦152677 Paul¦152678 wrote¦152685 to you¦152686 using the wisdom¦152684 that has been given¦152682 to him¦152683.
\v 16 He speaks¦152693 in all his letters¦152692 concerning¦152697 these¦152698 things, some of which are hard to understand¦152704 and which ignorant¦152708 and unstable¦152710 people twist just like they twist the other¦152716 scriptures¦152717 to their¦152719 own destruction¦152723.
