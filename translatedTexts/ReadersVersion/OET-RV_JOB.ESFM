\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk The account of Iyyov\bk* (but commonly as known as ‘Job’ which is the English evolution of the Germanic adaptation of the Greek adaptation Ἰώβ (Iōb) of his actual Hebrew name ‘אִיּוֹב’) is an account about a godly man who was struck by a series of tragedies: all his children and their families were killed, all his extensive wealth was lost, and then he was struck with a terrible disease. By means of this seven-part account, the reader is informed about how Iyyov and his friends react concerning those tragedies. Then finally, God reveals himself to Iyyov and the others.
\ip Near the beginning of this document, God is told by Satan that it's not good governing of his people if he always rewards those who obey him. What if people only obey God because they're after the material blessings that would always follow. This would mean that their obedience no longer comes from their hearts. Yes, that's what Satan said about Iyyov, so God allowed Satan to test Iyyov's heart to see if he'd continue to trust God in times of suffering and misery.
\ip Iyyov's traditional friends assumed that he must be suffering because he sinned. Surely he wouldn't suffer all that if he'd been honest and righteous. None of them could understand why God might allow sickness or disease to strike someone if he was truly a righteous person, but this is too simplistic for Iyyov to accept. Therefore he challenges God to present his case. In all of that, Iyyov's faith in God isn't lost, but he desires to regain his honour as an honest and godly person.
\ip God doesn't answer Iyyov's questions but he responds by displaying his own power and wisdom and knowledge. So then Iyyov acknowledges God as the wise creator and requests forgiveness for his angry words.
\ip The final segment of this account explains how Iyyov was restored to health, peace, and prosperity (all the elements of ‘shalom’/‘שָׁלוֹם’), and how he actually prospered even more than before. It also shows how God was angry at Iyyov's friends, because they had so much to say when none of them actually knew why Iyyov had suffered—only Iyyov had really sensed that God and his eventual (but eternal) justice is greater than simplistic proverbs and trite beliefs.

\mr (1:1–2:13)
\s1 Iyyov's prosperous life
\rem /s1 Prologue; Job and His Family; Satan Tests Job
\p
\v 1 \add Once\add* there was a man called Iyyov¦232252 \add (Job)\add* who lived in the Uz¦232251 region. \add He\add* was blameless¦232258 and righteous—both obeying God¦232261 and avoiding evil.
\v 2 He had seven¦232267 sons¦232268 and¦232269 three¦232269 daughters¦232270,
\v 3 and he owned 7,000 sheep¦232277, 3,000 camels¦232280, 1,000 cattle, and 500 donkeys¦232288, as well as many slaves. Iyyov was \add richer\add* than \add anyone else\add* who lived in the area east \add of the Jordan River\add*.
\v 4 \add Iyyov's\add* sons¦232303 \add regularly\add* held feasts in their¦232312 homes, and whenever any of them held a feast, he would invite¦232310 all his brothers and sisters¦232312 to share the meal with him.
\v 5 \add Then¦232318 once a feast¦232322 was over\add*, Iyyov would send \add for his children\add* and consecrate them—he got up early¦232326 in the morning¦232327 and offered burnt¦232329 offerings for each of them, because Iyyov said, “Perhaps my \add children\add* have sinned¦232336 and cursed\f + \fr 1:15 \ft Literally ‘blessed’ but it's possible that the original reading was ‘cursed’ and that scribes changed it to ‘blessed’ in order to avoid the uncomfortable concept of a person cursing God. Traditional manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible don't have a marginal notation about this (as they do in the case of 7:20), but LXX uses ‘ἐνενοήθησαν κακά’ which can be rendered as ‘have thought evil things’ and the Peshitta (Syriac) uses ‘reviled’. Many other translations also use ‘cursed’ since this is the kind of change that scribes are known to have made in similar cases.\f* God¦232339 in their¦232340 hearts¦232340.” \add ≈It was Job's regular habit to\add* \add intercede for his children\add*.
\s1 Satan's first attack on Iyyov
\rem /s1 Attack on Job's Character; Job's First Test
\p
\v 6 It was the day¦232350 that God's sons¦232352\f + \fr 1:6 \ft It's not clear from the text who these are.\f* came to present¦232354 themselves to Yahweh¦232357, and the adversary (Satan) was also there among them.\x + \xo 1:6: \xt Gen 6:2.\x*
\v 7 Yahweh¦232365 asked him, “Where have you¦232370 just come from?”
\p “I have come from the earth¦232378, where¦232369 I was travelling around¦232379 \add to see what was going on\add*.” Satan replied.
\p
\v 8 “Have you \add noticed\add* my servant¦232391 Iyyov¦232392?” Yahweh¦232383 asked. “There's no one else like him¦232395 on the \add whole\add* earth¦232396—a blameless¦232398 and righteous man¦232397 who obeys me God¦232401 and avoids \add anything\add* evil¦232403.”
\p
\v 9 “Does Iyyov¦232413 \add get\add* nothing¦232411 \add back\add* for respecting God¦232414?” Satan answered¦232405 Yahweh¦232409.
\v 10 “Don't you \add constantly protect\add* him and his household¦232424 and everything¦232431 that's his? You've blessed¦232434 \add what he works on\add*, and his \add livestock have multiplied prolifically\add*.
\v 11 However, just stretch¦232440 out your hand¦232443 and \add ruin\add* everything he has, then \add we'll see that\add* he'll curse¦232456 you¦232456 to your face¦232455.”
\p
\v 12 “Listen, \add I'll cede you control over\add* everything he has,” Yahweh replied. “Only \add just\add* don't¦232472 do \add anything\add* against \add Iyyov himself\add*.” \add So¦232458\add* the adversary went¦232476 away from Yahweh's \add presence¦232479\add*.
\s1 Satan destroys Iyyov's wealth and children
\rem /s1 Job Loses Property and Children; Job's Children and Wealth Are Destroyed
\p
\v 13 \add So¦232482 one\add* day¦232483 when \add Iyyov's\add* sons¦232484 and his daughters¦232485 were eating¦232486 and drinking¦232487 wine in their¦232490 eldest brother's¦232490 house¦232489,
\v 14 a messenger¦232493 came¦232494 to Iyyov¦232497 and \add reported\add*, “\add While\add* the oxen were plowing¦232501 and the donkeys¦232502 were feeding \add nearby\add*,
\v 15 the Sabeans¦232509 attacked¦232508 with their swords¦232517 and stole them \add all\add*. They killed all your slaves except that I \add managed to\add* escape¦232518 to tell you.”
\p
\v 16 \add While\add* he was still speaking¦232529, another \add messenger\add* came¦232531 and said¦232532, “The fire¦232533 of God¦232534 fell from the sky and burnt up the sheep¦232540 and the \add shepherds\add*. \add Only ashes are left\add*, except that I alone escaped¦232543 to tell you.”
\p
\v 17 \add While\add* he was still speaking¦232554, another \add one\add* came¦232556 and \add explained\add*, “The Chaldeans formed¦232559 into three¦232561 bands and \add raided\add* the camels¦232566 and took them, and they attacked the slaves with their swords¦232574, and I'm the only one who escaped¦232575 to \add come and\add* tell you.”
\p
\v 18 \add While\add* he was still speaking¦232585, another \add messenger\add* came¦232587 and said¦232588, “Your sons¦232589 and daughters¦232590 were eating¦232591 and drinking¦232592 wine in the house¦232594 of their¦232595 eldest brother¦232595
\v 19 when \add suddenly\add* a \add freak\add* wind¦232599 came¦232601 from across¦232603 the desert and struck¦232605 the house¦232608. It \add collapsed\add* on the young¦232612 people¦232612 and \add killed them\add*, and only I alone have escaped¦232614 to tell you.”
\p
\v 20 Then Iyyov¦232623 stood up and tore his robe¦232627 and shaved¦232628 his head. Then he knelt with his face to the ground and worshipped¦232634 \add God\add*,
\v 21 saying, “I came¦232638 naked from my mother's¦232641 womb, and I will \add leave this life\add* naked. Yahweh gave¦232647, and Yahweh has taken¦232649. May Yahweh's \add reputation???\add* be blessed¦232653.”
\p
\v 22 \add Through\add* all of that, Iyyov¦232661 didn't¦232658 \add disobey\add* God¦232666 or \add accuse him of being evil\add*.
\c 2
\s1 Satan's second attack on Iyyov
\rem /s1 Job's Second Test; Attack on Job's Health; Satan Tests Job Again
\p
\v 1 It was the day¦232670 that God's sons¦232672 came to present themselves to Yahweh¦232677 and the adversary (Satan) was also there among them.
\v 2 “Where have you come from?” Yahweh¦232689 \add asked\add* the adversary.
\p “From wandering on the earth¦232703 and going back and forth on it,” \add he\add* answered¦232696.
\p
\v 3 “Have you \add noticed\add* my servant¦232716 Iyyov¦232717 \add (Job)\add*?” Yahweh¦232708 asked Satan, “because there's¦232719 no one like him on the earth¦232721—a blameless¦232723 and righteous man¦232722, \add striving to obey\add* God¦232726 and turning from evil¦232728. And he's still¦232729 holding firmly to his integrity¦232731, even though you incited¦232732 me against him, to \add ruin\add* him for nothing.”
\p
\v 4 “Skin for skin,” replied the adversary, “\add actually, a person will give¦232750 everything they have to save their\add* life¦232752.
\v 5 However, just \add reach out\add* and touch¦232759 his flesh¦232765 and bones¦232762, \add and see\add* if he doesn't curse¦232772 you¦232772 to your face¦232771.”
\p
\v 6 “\add Listen\add*,” Yahweh¦232775 said¦232774 to \add him\add*, “\add I'll give you power¦232780 over him\add*, but you \add must\add* preserve¦232785 his life¦232784.”
\p
\v 7 So¦232793 the adversary went¦232787 away from Yahweh's¦232791 \add presence¦232790\add*, and he \add infected\add* Iyyov¦232795 with bad¦232797 boils from the sole of his foot¦232799 to \add the top of his head\add*.
\v 8 \add Iyyov picked up a piece of broken pottery\add* to \add scratch\add* himself with \add as\add* he sat \add down\add* in the middle¦232812 of a pile of ashes¦232814.
\p
\v 9 “Are you¦232819 still¦232819 holding tightly onto your¦232821 integrity¦232821?” his wife \add asked\add* him. “\add Just\add* curse God¦232823 and¦232824 die¦232824.”
\p
\v 10 “You're talking¦232831 like a foolish¦232830 \add person\add*,” Iyyov \add ≈replied\add*. “Should we \add only\add* accept good from God¦232838 and not receive the bad?” In all of that, Iyyov didn't¦232842 sin \add in what he said\add*.
\s1 Iyyov's three friends come

\p
\v 11 \add When\add* Iyyov's three¦232855 friends¦232857 heard¦232854 \add about all the troubles¦232862 that had happened to\add* him, they each came¦232866 from his place¦232868: Elifaz¦232869 from Teman¦232870, Bildad¦232871 from Shuah, and Zofar¦232873 from Naamah¦232874. They gathered together¦232876 to come¦232864 to console¦232878 and comfort¦232881 him.
\v 12 \add but when\add* they saw him from a distance¦232887, they \add barely\add* recognised¦232889 him. They \add wailed loudly\add*, and they \add ripped their own clothes\add*, and they threw¦232896 dust \add into the air so that it would fall\add* on their heads¦232900. \add (All three of those were traditional signs of mourning.)\add*
\v 13 Then¦232903 they sat with him \add there\add* on the ground¦232905 for seven days¦232907 and seven nights¦232909 without saying a \add single\add* word¦232914 to \add Iyyov\add* because they had seen that \add his\add* suffering¦232920 was extreme.

\v 1 Iyyov¦236788 \add ≈responded¦236789 to Bildad and companions again\add*:
\q1
\v 2 \add How much longer\add* will I be tormented¦236794
\q1 and¦236796 crushed¦236796 with words¦236797?
\q1
\v 3 You all have scolded me ten¦236800 times¦236801 now.
\q1 You all should be ashamed¦236805 for how you've ill-treated¦236806 me.
\q1
\v 4 And even if I had truly¦236812 done something wrong,
\q1 my error¦236816 would remain with \em me\em*.
\q1
\v 5 If you truly¦236820 think that you're all better than me,
\q1 and¦236823 use my disgrace¦236825 to argue against me,
\q1
\v 6 then you need to know¦236828 that God¦236831 has wronged¦236834 me,
\q1 and¦236835 he's closed¦236837 his net¦236835 around¦236836 me.
\q1
\v 7 There¦236839, I cry out that I'm being attacked and get no answer¦236843.
\q1 ≈I call for help but there's¦236845 no justice¦236846.
\q1
\v 8 He's blocked my road so I can't¦236850 get past,
\q1 ≈and he places darkness¦236854 over my paths¦236853.
\q1
\v 9 He's taken away \add all\add* my honour,
\q1 and¦236860 removed¦236860 the crown¦236861 from on my head.
\q1
\v 10 He's battered me from every direction and I'm gone.
\q1 He's removed my hope like a tree¦236868 that's been uprooted¦236867.
\q1
\v 11 He's directed his anger¦236873 against¦236872 me,
\q1 and¦236874 treats me as one of his enemies¦236876.
\q1
\v 12 His troops¦236881 advance \add in formation\add*.
\q1 They build up a siege¦236884 ramp against¦236883 me,
\q2 and set-up themselves up around¦236886 my tent.
\b
\q1
\v 13 He's moved my brothers far away from me,
\q1 ≈and¦236892 my acquaintances¦236892 have certainly kept out of my way.
\q1
\v 14 My relatives¦236899 have deserted me,
\q1 ≈and¦236900 my close¦236900 friends¦236900 have forgotten¦236901 me.
\q1
\v 15 Those who've stayed in my home, and¦236905 \add even\add* the female servants regard me as a stranger¦236906.
\q1 ≈I've become¦236909 a foreigner¦236908 in their¦236910 eyes¦236910.
\q1
\v 16 When I call my servant¦236912, he¦236915 doesn't answer¦236915.
\q1 ≈I try to persuade him with my \add words\add*.
\q1
\v 17 My breath¦236923 is repugnant to my wife¦236925,
\q1 and¦236926 abhorrent to my \add siblings\add*.
\q1
\v 18 Even young¦236932 boys¦236932 reject¦236933 me.
\q1 \add When\add* I stand they¦236933 speak \add against\add* me.
\q1
\v 19 All my closest friends abhor me,
\q1 and¦236945 those¦236945 I love¦236947 have turned¦236948 on me.
\q1
\v 20 My skin and flesh¦236953 cling¦236954 to my bones¦236955.
\q1 I've escaped¦236956 by the skin of my teeth¦236958.
\b
\q1
\v 21 Pity me, pity me, you¦236962 my friends¦236963,
\q1 \add because\add* God's hand¦236965 has touched¦236968 me.
\q1
\v 22 Why do you chase me as \add if you're God¦236975\add*?
\q1 Won't you be satisfied¦236978 with \add destroying\add* my body¦236976?
\b
\q1
\v 23 Who will permit that my words¦236985 be written¦236984 down?
\q1 ≈Who will allow them to be inscribed¦236990 onto a scroll¦236989
\q1
\v 24 with a pen¦236992 made of iron and¦236995 lead,
\q1 ≈or engraved¦236998 onto stone with a chisel.
\q1
\v 25 I \add do\add* know¦237001 that my redeemer¦237002 lives¦237003,
\q1 and that he will stand¦237008 on the dust at the end.
\q1
\v 26 After my skin has been struck¦237012 off,
\q1 then in my flesh¦237015, I'll see¦237016 God¦237017,
\q1
\v 27 \add yes,\add* I'll see him for myself.
\q1 My eyes¦237025 will see, and not a stranger¦237029.
\q1 My heart¦237031 will \add feel\add* faint¦237030 within my¦237032 chest.
\b
\q1
\v 28 You all will say¦237035, ‘How will we¦237039 persecute¦237039 him
\q1 because the root of the matter¦237043 is found¦237044 in \add him\add*?’
\q1
\v 29 You¦237061 all \add should\add* be afraid¦237048 of the sword,
\q2 because anger bring punishment by then sword,
\q1 so that \add you\add* will know that \add there is\add* judgement¦237061.

\s1 Zofar's second response to Iyyov
\rem /s1 Zophar Speaks: Wickedness Receives Just Retribution; Zophar; Zophar's Second Response to Job
\p
\v 1 Then Zofar (from Naamah¦237067) \add ≈responded¦237068 to Iyyov\add*:
\q1
\v 2 My anxious thoughts¦237071 \add force\add* me to answer¦237072,
\q1 because¦237073 of the turmoil that's within me.
\q1
\v 3 I've¦237079 heard¦237079 \add your\add* correction¦237077 \add and\add* it insults¦237078 me,
\q1 and a spirit¦237080 beyond¦237081 my¦237078 understanding¦237081 answers¦237082 me.
\q1
\v 4 Do you¦237085 know¦237085 this from long ago,
\q1 ≈from back when humankind¦237091 was placed on the earth¦237094:
\q1
\v 5 that the excited shout of wicked¦237098 \add people\add* is brief,
\q1 ≈and¦237100 the happiness of godless¦237101 \add people\add* only lasts a moment¦237104?
\q1
\v 6 Although \add their\add* arrogance¦237110 rises up to the sky,
\q1 and¦237111 \add their\add* heads reach¦237113 into the clouds¦237112,
\q1
\v 7 \add they\add* will vanish forever¦237116 like \add their\add* own dung—
\q1 ≈those who had seen¦237118 them will ask, ‘Where are \add they now\add*?’
\q1
\v 8 \add They'll\add* fly away like a dream¦237122 that can't¦237124 be found¦237125 \add again\add*,
\q1 ≈and be chased¦237126 away like a vision¦237127 in the night¦237128.
\q1
\v 9 Whoever saw¦237131 \add them\add* won't \add see them again\add*,
\q1 ≈and \add even\add* the place¦237138 \add where they lived\add* won't see \add them\add* again.
\q1
\v 10 \add Their\add* children will be seeking the favour¦237141 of poor \add people\add*,
\q1 ≈\add because their own\add* hands¦237143 \add must\add* return¦237144 \add their\add* wealth¦237145.
\q1
\v 11 \add Although their\add* bones were full of youthful¦237149 vigour,
\q1 that \add same strength\add* will lie down with \add them\add* in the dust.
\b
\q1
\v 12 Although \add their\add* evil¦237161 tastes¦237159 sweet¦237159 in \add their\add* mouths¦237160,
\q1 \add they\add* hide it under¦237163 \add their\add* tongues¦237164.
\q1
\v 13 \add They\add* would miss it too much to let it go¦237169,
\q1 and they keep it \add there\add* in the middle¦237171 of \add their\add* mouths¦237172.
\q1
\v 14 \add But that\add* food changes¦237176 in \add their\add* stomachs¦237175.
\q1 ≈It becomes like snake venom¦237177 inside¦237179 \add them\add*.
\q1
\v 15 \add They\add* swallow¦237182 up wealth \add but then\add* vomit¦237183 it up.
\q1 ≈God¦237186 forces it out of \add their\add* stomachs¦237184.
\q1
\v 16 \add They'll\add* suck on cobra¦237190 poison¦237188.
\q1 ≈The viper's¦237194 fangs will kill¦237192 \add them\add*.
\q1
\v 17 \add Those wicked people\add* won't enjoy the streams¦237199,
\q1 \add or the\add* fast-flowing rivers¦237200 of honey¦237202 and¦237203 yoghurt.
\q1
\v 18 \add They\add* will return what \add they've gained\add* and not swallow¦237208 it \add down\add*.
\q1 ≈\add They\add* won't¦237207 get any enjoyment from the profits¦237209 of \add their\add* trading¦237210.
\q1
\v 19 \add They've\add* oppressed \add others\add* and¦237221 ignored the poor.
\q1 ≈\add They've\add* seized¦237220 homes that they didn't¦237221 build¦237222.
\b
\q1
\v 20 \add Their\add* bellies¦237230 are never at ease.
\q1 \add They\add* never deliver¦237233 what \add they\add* desire¦237231.
\q1
\v 21 There's¦237235 nothing left over from \add their\add* eating,
\q1 so their prosperity¦237245 won't¦237235 endure¦237244.
\q1
\v 22 \add They'll\add* be so full \add but\add* it'll \add only\add* bring distress¦237249.
\q1 Every troublemaker will come¦237255 to \add them\add*.
\q1
\v 23 Maybe when \add they've\add* filled their bellies,
\q1 \add God\add* will send¦237261 his anger¦237266 against \add them\add*,
\q2 raining down on \add them and¦237267 their\add* meal.
\q1
\v 24 \add They\add* flee from weapons¦237272 made of iron.
\q1 ≈A bow made of brass \add sends its arrows\add* right through \add them\add*.
\q1
\v 25 \add They\add* pull them through and out \add their\add* backs.
\q1 The tips have shiny liver¦237282 on them—terrors¦237285 come¦237283 over \add them\add*.
\q1
\v 26 Total darkness¦237289 is reserved for \add their\add* treasures¦237291.
\q1 A fire¦237293 \add which¦237294 no one started\add* will devour¦237292 \add them\add*.
\q1 Only sorry remnants will survive¦237298 in \add their\add* tents.
\q1
\v 27 The heavens¦237302 will reveal¦237301 \add their\add* evils,
\q1 and¦237304 the earth¦237304 will rise up against \add them\add*.
\q1
\v 28 The contents of \add their\add* houses¦237310 will be removed—
\q1 washed away in his severe¦237313 anger¦237313.
\q1
\v 29 That's what God serves up to wicked¦237320 people,
\q1 ≈and¦237322 the heritage¦237322 that God has decreed¦237323 for them.

\p
\v 1 Then Iyyov¦237328 \add ≈responded¦237329 to Zofar and the others\add*:
\q1
\v 2 Listen¦237331 carefully¦237332 to my words¦237333,
\q1 and¦237334 let this be a consolation¦237337 for you all.
\q1
\v 3 Bear with me while I speak¦237341,
\q1 and after¦237342 I've \add finished\add*, you¦237344 can continue mocking then.
\q1
\v 4 As for me, is my complaint¦237348 against any person?
\q1 If it was, then \add you\add* might expect \add me to be impatient\add*.
\q1
\v 5 Turn \add and look\add* at me and be appalled¦237360.
\q1 ≈\add Yes,\add* put your hands over your mouths¦237365 \add in shock\add*.
\q1
\v 6 When I remember¦237369 \add what happened\add*, I'm horrified,
\q1 and my body¦237372 starts shuddering¦237373.
\q1
\v 7 Why do wicked¦237376 \add people\add* live¦237377?
\q1 ≈\add Why\add* do they grow old and become¦237381 more powerful?
\q1
\v 8 Their children become established¦237385 around them,
\q1 ≈and their offspring¦237388 \add become settled\add* in front of them.
\q1
\v 9 Their homes are safe and¦237394 \add free from\add* fear¦237393.
\q1 ≈God¦237396 isn't¦237394 punishing them.
\q1
\v 10 Their bulls mate \add productively\add*,
\q1 ≈and their cows calve¦237403 without miscarrying¦237406.
\q1
\v 11 They send¦237408 out their little¦237410 ones like a flock¦237409,
\q1 ≈and their children¦237411 dance¦237412 \add all around\add*.
\q1
\v 12 They pick up their tambourines¦237415 and harps,
\q1 ≈and they're happy to hear the sound¦237418 of the flutes¦237419.
\q1
\v 13 They¦237426 spend their¦237424 days¦237424 in prosperity¦237423,
\q1 and¦237425 they¦237427 go¦237427 peacefully¦237425 down \add to the grave\add*.
\q1
\v 14 They tell God¦237430, “Leave us alone.
\q1 We're not \add interested\add* in knowing about your¦237434 ways¦237434.
\q1
\v 15 Who is ‘the provider’ \add and why should\add* we serve¦237443 him.
\q1 What would we gain if we made requests to him?”
\b
\q1
\v 16 \add However,\add* their prosperity¦237455 isn't¦237453 in \em their\em* hands¦237454.
\q1 I keep far away from the advice of wicked¦237457 \add people\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 17 How often¦237461 is the lamp of wicked¦237465 \add people\add* extinguished¦237466 and calamity¦237469 hits them?
\q1 In his anger¦237472, does he dole out pain to them?
\q1
\v 18 Are they \add just\add* like straw¦237475 \add blown by\add* the wind,
\q1 ≈and like chaff¦237479 that's carried¦237480 away by a gale.
\b
\q1
\v 19 God saves up \add their\add* evil for \add their\add* children¦237486.
\q1 Let \add God\add* repay¦237488 \add them\add* so \add they'll\add* know¦237490.
\q1
\v 20 Let them watch \add their\add* own destruction¦237495,
\q1 and¦237496 let \add them\add* drink¦237498 the severe¦237496 anger¦237496 of the provider.
\q1
\v 21 After they're gone, why would \add they\add* care about their families¦237504?
\q1 ≈Why would they count the months¦237507 after¦237505 they've already been cut off?
\q1
\v 22 Can any \add person\add* teach¦237511 knowledge¦237513 to God¦237510
\q1 since he judges¦237516 the \add high and mighty\add*?
\b
\q1
\v 23 \add Some people\add* die¦237519 in full strength,
\q1 completely¦237522 secure and¦237524 at ease.
\q1
\v 24 Their buckets are full of milk,
\q1 and¦237529 their bone marrow¦237529 is \add nicely\add* moistened.
\q1
\v 25 \add But¦237533 others\add* die¦237534 full of bitterness¦237536,
\q1 and¦237537 \add they\add* haven't tasted prosperity¦237540.
\q1
\v 26 \add Both kinds of people\add* lie together in the dust,
\q1 and¦237547 worms¦237547 cover¦237548 them \add both\add*.
\q1
\v 27 \add Yes,\add* I know¦237552 what you're all thinking,
\q1 and¦237554 the schemes¦237554 that you'd all use against me.
\q1
\v 28 You all say¦237559, ‘\add Which\add* is the house¦237561 of that respected \add person\add*?
\q1 And \add ≈which\add* are the tents that the wicked¦237568 \add people\add* live in?’
\b
\q1
\v 29 Haven't you all asked¦237571 those¦237572 travelling on the roads?
\q1 Don't you all accept their¦237574 reports
\q1
\v 30 that evil \add people\add* are spared¦237581 from the day of calamity¦237580—
\q1 that they are led away from \add that\add* day of anger?
\q1
\v 31 Who will denounce \add their\add* actions to \add their\add* faces¦237592?
\q1 ≈Who will repay¦237598 \add them\add* for \add the evil they've\add* done?
\q1
\v 32 They'll be carried off to the cemetery,
\q1 ≈and¦237605 someone¦237608 will keep¦237608 watch¦237608 over \add their\add* tombs.
\q1
\v 33 The clods¦237613 of the riverbed will be sweet¦237610 to \add them\add*.
\q1 Everyone will follow¦237619 along behind \add them\add*,
\q2 ≈and \add no one\add* can count those who go in front of \add them\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 34 \add So¦237624\add* how can vanity¦237626 be of comfort¦237625 to me?
\q1 It's only faithlessness that remains¦237628 from the replies that you all \add have given\add*.

\v 1 Then Elifaz¦237634 (from Teman¦237635) responded¦237636 \add to Iyyov\add*:
\q1
\v 2 Can a human be of use to God¦237638?\x + \xo 22:2-3: \xt Yob 35:6-8.\x*
\q1 ≈Might a wise \add person\add* be of any use to him¦237645?
\q1
\v 3 Does it give pleasure¦237648 to the provider if you're innocent?
\q1 ≈Will he benefit if you're blameless¦237657 in your¦237658 actions?
\q1
\v 4 Does he scold you for your religiosity?
\q1 ≈Does he go¦237662 with you into judgement¦237664?
\q1
\v 5 Your wickedness¦237667 is really bad,
\q1 ≈and there's¦237669 no end¦237671 to your evil actions.
\q1
\v 6 You've forced your brothers¦237677 into unnecessary debt to you.
\q1 ≈You've demanded clothes¦237679 \add in payment\add* and left \add people\add* naked¦237680.
\q1
\v 7 You \add never\add* gave¦237687 exhausted \add people\add* anything to drink¦237687,
\q1 ≈and you refused to give food to those who were hungry¦237688.
\q1
\v 8 The land belongs to a powerful man.
\q1 ≈A man who \add was\add* honoured¦237697 lives on it.
\q1
\v 9 You sent¦237703 widows away empty-handed¦237704,
\q1 ≈and¦237705 the strength¦237705 of orphans has been crushed¦237707.
\q1
\v 10 Because of that there's traps set all around¦237712 you,
\q1 and sudden¦237716 fear terrifies¦237714 you,
\q1
\v 11 or darkness¦237720 so you can't¦237721 see¦237723,
\q1 and a flood¦237724 of water¦237726 covers¦237727 you.
\b
\q1
\v 12 Isn't¦237738 God¦237731 as high as the sky,
\q1 and¦237734 look at how high the tops of those stars¦237737 are!
\q1
\v 13 \add You might ask\add*, ‘What does God¦237746 know¦237745?
\q1 Will he judge¦237749 through¦237747 thick¦237748 darkness¦237748?
\q1
\v 14 Clouds¦237751 block things off from him so he can't¦237756 see¦237757.
\q1 He walks¦237760 around \add way up there\add* on top of the heavens¦237759.’
\q1
\v 15 Will you¦237764 stay on the ancient paths,
\q1 on which¦237765 wicked¦237769 \add people regularly\add* tred?
\q1
\v 16 They were captured at an inappropriate time¦237776—
\q1 a torrent \add of water\add* poured¦237778 over their¦237779 foundations¦237779.
\q1
\v 17 They had told God¦237782, ‘Leave us alone,’
\q1 and¦237785 ‘What can the provider do for us?’
\q1
\v 18 \add But¦237791\add* he had filled¦237792 their¦237793 houses¦237793 with good¦237794 \add things¦237794\add*,
\q1 and I keep far away from the advice of wicked¦237796 \add people\add*.
\q1
\v 19 \add Godly people\add* are happy when they see¦237800 that, WHAT?
\q1 ≈and innocent¦237803 \add people\add* mock them. WHO?

\v 20 If he¦237811 didn't¦237810 destroy our¦237812 enemies, MEANING?

\q1
\v 21 \add Now\add* be reconciled¦237817 with him and¦237821 at peace¦237821.

\v 21 It's hidden from the eyes¦238945 of every¦238946 living¦238948 creature.

\q1
\v 2 How I wish for \add my life\add* in the months¦239028 of the past,
\q1 ≈in the days¦239031 when God¦239032 watched¦239033 over me.
\q1
\v 3 When his lamp shone¦239035 over my head.
\q1 ≈When I walked¦239040 in the darkness¦239041 by his light¦239039.
\q1
\v 4 I was \add still\add* in my prime¦239046 in those days¦239045,

\q1
\v 5 When the provider was still¦239052 with me.
\q1 ≈When my¦239055 children¦239056 were all around¦239055 me.
\q1
\v 6 When my path was greased with butter¦239060,
\q1 ≈and¦239061 the rock¦239061 poured¦239062 streams¦239064 of olive oil out for me.
\q1
\v 7 When I went¦239068 to \add the gathering of the city elders at\add* the city gate.
\q1 ≈When I took my seat¦239075 in the public square¦239073.
\q1
\v 8 Young men¦239078 saw me and got out of the way,
\q1 ≈and the old people got up and remained standing.
\q1
\v 9 The leaders would stop their conversations,
\q1 and put their hands¦239087 over their mouths¦239089.
\q1
\v 10 The voices¦239091 of the nobles¦239093 were hushed,

\q1
\v 11 \add ≈Those who listened to me\add* commended¦239102 me,
\q1 ≈and \add ≈those who saw¦239104 me\add* approved¦239105 of me,

\v 12 because I¦239109 rescued¦239109 the poor who cried¦239111 out,
\q1 ≈and the fatherless who had no one to help¦239111 them.
\q1
\v 13 Those who were close to dying gave me their blessing¦239118,

\q1
\v 14 I put on obedience like a cloak.
\q1 ≈My justice¦239131 was like a robe¦239129 and a turban¦239130.

\v 15 I was the eyes for the blind¦239135,

\q1
\v 16 I was a father¦239140 for the needy¦239142,

\q1
\v 17 I¦239153 broke¦239149 the jaws\f + \fr 29:17 \ft Of course this is figurative language as you can see from the second line of the doublet.\f* of unjust¦239151 \add >people\add*,

\q1
\v 18 I had thought¦239156 that I would \add ≈die in my own home\add*,

\v 21 They listened¦239183 to me and they waited¦239184,

\q1
\v 22 After¦239190 my talk, they¦239192 \add still\add* didn't¦239191 speak,
\q1 \add because\add* my words slowly sunk into them like the dew.
\q1
\v 23 They waited¦239197 for me like \add a farmer\add* waits for rain,

\q1
\v 24 I smiled at them \add even when\add* they didn't believe¦239207 \add <me\add*,
\q1 and they didn't cause the \add ≈delight\add* on my face¦239209 to falter.
\q1
\v 25 I chose¦239213 their¦239214 path¦239214 and I sat¦239215 as a chief¦239216,
