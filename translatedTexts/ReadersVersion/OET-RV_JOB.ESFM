\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk The account of Iyyov\bk* (but commonly as known as ‘Job’ which is the English evolution of the Germanic adaptation of the Greek adaptation Ἰώβ (Iōb) of his actual Hebrew name ‘אִיּוֹב’.) is an account about a godly man who was struck by a series of tragedies: all his children and their families were killed, all his extensive wealth was lost, and then he was struck with a terrible disease. By means of this seven-part account, the reader is informed about how Iyyov and his friends react concerning those tragedies. Then finally, God reveals himself to Iyyov.
\ip Near the beginning of this document, God is told by Satan that it's not good governing of his people if he always rewards those who obey him. XXX Therefore there egpangkus of iyan just reason doing of righteous/honest/sensible the people due to gift. And/Now no longer from heart their the making ran of righteous/honest/sensible. And/Now this indeed the said by Satan concerning Iyyov. Therefore allowed of God Satan test the pegkamatinumanen of Iyyov if continue just pad he righteous/honest/sensible if suffers he.
\ip And/Now by means of ancient faith, understood of friends of Iyyov suffered he due to because sinned he. But for to Iyyov, not wishfully correct suffers he of that punishment because righteous/honest/sensible ma he person. Not/None din understood if why of allowed of God eggingumaan he of makaliyas-liyas sickness of righteous/honest/sensible ma he person. Therefore inhanggat din the God go there them of hukumanan. And/Now even pad due, not/none naawei the faith of Iyyov, but desire his eg-ileen he righteous/honest/sensible of God, and accepted din just the kabantug as righteous/honest/sensible person.
\ip God didn't answer Iyyov's questions. But inggehet just of God the faith of Iyyov, by means of power and wisdom/knowledge din. And/Now recognised by Iyyov greatest wise the God, other of humility din, and requested he of forgiveness of nenallalag din from anger din.
\ip The final segment of this account explains how Iyyov was restored to health, peace, and prosperity (all the elements of ‘shalom’/‘שָׁלוֹם’), and how he actually prospered even more than before. It also shows how God was angry at Iyyov's friends, because they had so much to say when none of them actually knew why Iyyov had suffered—only Iyyov had really sensed that God and his eventual (but eternal) justice is greater than simplistic proverbs and trite beliefs.

\ms1 SECTION ONE: The introduction
\mr (1:1–2:13)
\s1 Iyyov's prosperous life
\rem /s1 Prologue; Job and His Family; Satan Tests Job
\p
\v 1 \add Once\add* there was a man called Iyyov¦232252 \add (Job)\add* who lived in the Uz region. \add He\add* was blameless¦232258 and righteous—both obeying God¦232261 and avoiding evil.
\v 2 He had seven¦232267 sons¦232268 and¦232269 three¦232269 daughters¦232270,
\v 3 and he owned 7,000 sheep¦232277, 3,000 camels¦232280, 1,000 cattle, and 500 donkeys¦232288, as well as many slaves. Iyyov was \add richer\add* than \add anyone else\add* who lived in the area east \add of the Jordan River\add*.
\v 4 \add Iyyov's\add* sons¦232303 \add regularly\add* held feasts in their¦232312 homes, and whenever any of them held a feast, he would invite¦232310 all his brothers and sisters¦232312 to share the meal with him.
\v 5 \add Then once a feast¦232322 was over\add*, Iyyov would send \add for his children\add* and consecrate them—he got up early¦232326 in the morning¦232327 and offered burnt¦232329 offerings for each of them, because Iyyov said, “Perhaps my \add children\add* have sinned¦232336 and blessed God¦232339 in their¦232340 hearts¦232340.” Thus Job did all the days.
\s1 Satan's first attack on Iyyov
\rem /s1 Attack on Job's Character; Job's First Test
\p
\v 6 It was the day¦232350 that God's sons¦232352\f + \fr 1:6 \ft It's not clear from the text who these are.\f* came to present¦232354 themselves to Yahweh¦232357, and the adversary (Satan) was also there among them.\x + \xo 1:6: \xt Gen 6:2.\x*
\v 7 Yahweh asked him, “Where have you¦232370 just come from?”
\p “I have come from the earth¦232378, where¦232369 I was travelling around¦232379 \add to see what was going on\add*.” Satan replied.
\p
\v 8 “Have you \add noticed\add* my servant¦232391 Iyyov¦232392?” Yahweh¦232383 asked. “There's no one else like him¦232395 on the \add whole\add* earth¦232396—a blameless¦232398 and righteous man¦232397 who obeys me God¦232401 and avoids \add anything\add* evil¦232403.”
\p
\v 9 “Does Iyyov¦232413 \add get\add* nothing¦232411 \add back\add* for respecting God¦232414?” Satan answered¦232405 Yahweh¦232409.
\v 10 “Don't you \add constantly protect\add* him and his household¦232424 and everything¦232431 that's his? You've blessed¦232434 \add what he works on\add*, and his \add livestock have multiplied prolifically\add*.
\v 11 However, just stretch¦232440 out your hand¦232443 and \add ruin\add* everything he has, then \add we'll see that\add* he'll curse¦232456 you¦232456 to your face¦232455.”
\p
\v 12 “Listen, \add I'll cede you control over\add* everything he has,” Yahweh replied. “Only \add just\add* don't¦232472 do \add anything\add* against \add Iyyov himself\add*.” \add So\add* the adversary went¦232476 away from Yahweh's \add presence¦232479\add*.
\s1 Satan destroys Iyyov's wealth and children
\rem /s1 Job Loses Property and Children; Job's Children and Wealth Are Destroyed
\p
\v 13 \add So one\add* day¦232483 when \add Iyyov's\add* sons¦232484 and his daughters¦232485 were eating¦232486 and drinking¦232487 wine in their¦232490 eldest brother's¦232490 house¦232489,
\v 14 a messenger¦232493 came¦232494 to Iyyov¦232497 and \add reported\add*, “\add While\add* the oxen were plowing¦232501 and the donkeys¦232502 were feeding \add nearby\add*,
\v 15 the Sabeans¦232509 attacked¦232508 with their swords¦232517 and stole them \add all\add*. They killed all your slaves except that I \add managed to\add* escape¦232518 to tell you.”
\p
\v 16 \add While\add* he was still speaking¦232529, another \add messenger\add* came¦232531 and said¦232532, “The fire¦232533 of God¦232534 fell from the sky and burnt up the sheep¦232540 and the \add shepherds\add*. \add Only ashes are left\add*, except that I alone escaped¦232543 to tell you.”
\p
\v 17 \add While\add* he was still speaking¦232554, another \add one\add* came¦232556 and \add explained\add*, “The Chaldeans formed¦232559 into three¦232561 bands and \add raided\add* the camels¦232566 and took them, and they attacked the slaves with their swords¦232574, and I'm the only one who escaped¦232575 to \add come and\add* tell you.”
\p
\v 18 \add While\add* he was still speaking¦232585, another \add messenger\add* came¦232587 and said¦232588, “Your sons¦232589 and daughters¦232590 were eating¦232591 and drinking¦232592 wine in the house¦232594 of their¦232595 eldest brother¦232595
\v 19 when \add suddenly\add* a \add freak\add* wind¦232599 came¦232601 from across¦232603 the desert and struck¦232605 the house¦232608. It \add collapsed\add* on the young¦232612 people¦232612 and \add killed them\add*, and only I alone have escaped¦232614 to tell you.”
\p
\v 20 Then Iyyov¦232623 stood up and tore his robe¦232627 and shaved¦232628 his head. Then he knelt with his face to the ground and worshipped¦232634 \add God\add*,
\v 21 saying, “I came¦232638 naked from my mother's¦232641 womb, and I will \add leave this life\add* naked. Yahweh gave¦232647, and Yahweh has taken¦232649. May Yahweh's \add reputation???\add* be blessed¦232653.”
\p
\v 22 \add Through\add* all of that, Iyyov¦232661 didn't \add disobey\add* God¦232666 or \add accuse him of being evil\add*.
\c 2
\s1 Satan's second attack on Iyyov
\rem /s1 Job's Second Test; Attack on Job's Health; Satan Tests Job Again
\p
\v 1 It was the day¦232670 that God's sons¦232672 came to present themselves to Yahweh and the adversary (Satan) was also there among them.
\v 2 “Where have you come from?” Yahweh \add asked\add* the adversary.
\p “From wandering on the earth¦232703 and going back and forth on it,” \add he\add* answered¦232696.
\p
\v 3 “Have you \add noticed\add* my servant¦232716 Iyyov¦232717 \add (Job)\add*?” Yahweh¦232708 asked Satan, “because there's¦232719 no one like him on the earth¦232721—a blameless¦232723 and righteous man¦232722, \add striving to obey\add* God¦232726 and turning from evil¦232728. And he's still¦232729 holding firmly to his integrity¦232731, even though you incited¦232732 me against him, to \add ruin\add* him for nothing.”
\p
\v 4 “Skin for skin,” replied the adversary, “\add actually, a person will give¦232750 everything they have to save their\add* life¦232752.
\v 5 However, just \add reach out\add* and touch¦232759 his flesh¦232765 and bones¦232762, \add and see\add* if he doesn't curse¦232772 you¦232772 to your face¦232771.”
\p
\v 6 “\add Listen\add*,” Yahweh¦232775 said¦232774 to \add him\add*, “\add I'll give you power¦232780 over him\add*, but you \add must\add* preserve¦232785 his life¦232784.”
\p
\v 7 So¦232793 the adversary went¦232787 away from Yahweh's¦232791 \add presence¦232790\add*, and he \add infected\add* Iyyov¦232795 with bad¦232797 boils from the sole of his foot¦232799 to \add the top of his head\add*.
\v 8 \add Iyyov picked up a piece of broken pottery\add* to \add scratch\add* himself with \add as\add* he sat \add down\add* in the middle¦232812 of a pile of ashes¦232814.
\p
\v 9 “Are you¦232819 still¦232819 holding tightly onto your¦232821 integrity¦232821?” his wife \add asked\add* him. “\add Just\add* curse God¦232823 and¦232824 die¦232824.”
\p
\v 10 “You're talking¦232831 like a foolish¦232830 \add person\add*,” Iyyov \add replied\add*. “Should we \add only\add* accept good from God and not receive the bad?” In all of that, Iyyov didn't sin \add in what he said\add*.
\s1 Iyyov's three friends come
\rem /s1 Job's Friends Come; Job's Three Friends Share His Anguish; Job's Three Friends
\p
\v 11 \add When\add* Iyyov's three¦232855 friends¦232857 heard¦232854 \add about all the troubles¦232862 that had happened to\add* him, they each came¦232866 from his place¦232868: Elifaz from Teman¦232870, Bildad from Shuah, and Zofar¦232873 from Naamah¦232874. They gathered together¦232876 to come¦232864 to console¦232878 and comfort¦232881 him.
\v 12 \add but when\add* they saw him from a distance¦232887, they \add barely\add* recognised¦232889 him. They \add wailed loudly\add*, and they \add ripped their own clothes\add*, and they threw¦232896 dust \add into the air so that it would fall\add* on their heads¦232900. \add (All three of those were traditional signs of mourning.)\add*
\v 13 Then they sat with him \add there\add* on the ground¦232905 for seven days¦232907 and seven nights¦232909 without saying a \add single\add* word¦232914 to \add Iyyov\add* because they had seen that \add his\add* suffering¦232920 was extreme.

\v 2 He said:
\q1
\v 3 May the day¦232942 on which I was born perish¦232941,
\q1 and¦232946 the night¦232946 that said¦232947, ‘A boy has been conceived¦232948.’
\q1
\v 4 May that day¦232951 be dark.
\q1 May God¦232958 not search for it from above¦232959
\q2 and may no light shine¦232962 on it.
\q1
\v 5 May darkness¦232967 and a dark shadow¦232968 claim it.
\q1 May a cloud¦232972 dwell over it.
\q1 May the blacknesses of the day¦232975 terrify¦232973 it.
\q1
\v 6 May gloom¦232980 take that night¦232977.
\q1 May it not be happy among the days¦232984 of the year¦232985.
\q1 May it not enter into the number¦232986 of months¦232987.
\q1
\v 7 Listen, may that night¦232993 be barren¦232996.
\q1 May a happy shout never enter it.
\q1
\v 8 May¦233009 those who curse days, curse that one—
\q1 \add yes,\add* those \add people\add* who're skillful enough to wake up the large sea monster.
\q1
\v 9 May the stars¦233012 of its twilight be dark.
\q1 May it stay waiting for the light¦233016 that never \add arrives\add*.
\q1 May it not see the dawn \add breaking\add*.

\v 10 Because it¦233027 didn't close the doors¦233028 of my \add mother's\add* womb,

\v 2 If \add someone\add* tries \add to talk\add* with you, will it wear you out?
\q1 \add But\add* who can resist \add answering\add*?
\q1
\v 3 Listen, you've instructed¦233197 many \add other people\add*.
\q1 And you've \add encouraged those who were\add* weak.

\v 4 Your words¦233206 have encouraged those who were stumbling¦233203.

\q1 Or when were godly people \add ever\add* destroyed¦233237?
\b
\q1
\v 8 Just like I've seen¦233240 those who plant evil and¦233243 sow mischief¦233244 harvest it¦233245 \add back again\add*,

\q1

\q1 and the hairs on my body \add stood on end\add*.
\q1
\v 16 It stood¦233304 still¦233304, but I didn't recognise¦233308 what it was.
\q1 There was an image in front of my eyes¦233312.
\q1 It was silent and then I heard¦233315 a voice¦233314:
\q1
\v 17 ‘Can a mortal \add human\add* be innocent before¦233318 God¦233318?
\q1 Can a person be more pure than the creator of people?‘\f + \fr 4:17 \ft All speech marks in Bible translations are added by the translators. It's not certain from the text whether or not this was what ‘the voice’ said, and if it is (as we assumed), it's not clear where ‘the voice’ stopped speaking and Elifaz resumes. (Many translations put it at the end of the chapter, but remember that chapter breaks are also rather arbitrary and not in the original manuscripts.)\f*
\q1
\v 18 Listen, he doesn't \add even\add* trust¦233329 his \add own\add* servants¦233327,
\q1 and he accuses his \add own\add* messengers of making mistakes.

\v 1 \add After that\add* those three¦239930 men¦239931 stopped answering¦239933 Iyyov, because \add ≈they considered that he had just been trying to justify himself\add*.

\v 3 He was also \add ≈angry\add* at \add Iyyov's\add* three¦239962 friends¦239963, because they¦239970 had declared that he¦239965 was wrong, yet hadn't found¦239970 any \add reasonable justification for it¦239964\add*.

\q1 I'm \add only\add* young¦240010 and all of you are much older than me,

\q1 Even the livestock¦241381 know what's coming.
\c 37
\q1
\v 1 My heart¦241391 also pounds \add after\add* that
\q2 and¦241392 it¦241390 jumps away from its¦241393 place¦241393.
\q1
\v 2 Listen¦241395, hear his thunderous¦241397 voice¦241398,
\q1 and¦241399 the \add low\add* rumbling¦241399 that comes¦241401 from his mouth¦241400.
\q1
\v 3 He releases \add ?@the thundering\add* under all the skies,
\q1 ≈and his lightning¦241409 to the end of the earth¦241413.
\q1
\v 4 After¦241415 that, a voice roars¦241417 out.
\q1 He¦241425 thunders¦241420 with his majestic¦241422 voice,
\q1 and¦241423 he¦241420 doesn't restrain¦241424 \add ?@the lightning bolts\add*.
\q1
\v 5 \add ≈When God¦241431 speaks, it's awesome, like thunder¦241430\add*,
\q1 doing¦241434 amazing \add >things\add* that we¦241437 \add ≈can't even comprehend\add*.
\q1
\v 6 He tells the snow when to fall to the earth¦241445,
\q1 ≈and \add ≡commands\add* the shower of rain to become a downpour.
\q1
\v 7 He puts a seal on everyone¦241461's \add #hands\add*,
\q2 \add ?≈so that everyone knows that he made them\add*.
\q1
\v 8 The wild \add #animals\add* go into their \add #lairs\add*,
\q1 ≈and they stay inside their dens.
\q1
\v 9 A gale comes¦241475 out of its room,
\q1 and¦241477 the cold is brought by the north winds¦241477.
\q1
\v 10 God's breath¦241480 delivers ice,
\q1 and¦241486 the wide \add ≈lakes\add* freeze over.
\q1
\v 11 Indeed he loads the \add #clouds\add* with moisture¦241492.
\q1 He scatters¦241495 his lightning¦241497 through \add *them\add*.
\q1
\v 12 They go round¦241500 in circles \add then\add* turning¦241502 with his guidance¦241503—
\q1 following his instructions right across the earth,
\q1
\v 13 whether it¦241525's for correction¦241518 or for the land,
\q2 or because of his favour¦241524 that he causes¦241525 it to happen.
\b
\q1
\v 14 Just listen to this, Iyyov.
\q1 Stand still¦241530 and consider¦241531 how incredible God's actions are.
\q1
\v 15 Do you understand how God¦241539 makes these things happen,
\q1 and how his clouds¦241543 are able to flash¦241541 with lightning¦241542?
\q1
\v 16 Do you know how the \add #clouds\add* balance¦241548 \add at just that level\add*?
\q1 \add ≡Do you understand\add* the activities of the \add >one\add* who has perfect knowledge¦241553?
\q1
\v 17 You whose clothes \add get\add* hot
\q2 when the south¦241561 wind¦241561 brings \add hot\add*, still¦241559 \add air\add*.
\q1
\v 18 Can you¦241563 flatten out the \add #sky\add* like him,
\q1 as solid as a cast \add metal\add* mirror¦241567.
\q1
\v 19 Teach¦241570 us what we should say¦241574 to him.
\q1 We can't get organised \add here\add* in the darkness¦241581.
\q1
\v 20 Should he be informed that I want to speak¦241588,
\q1 or will anyone¦241592 who talks get swallowed¦241594 up?
\q1
\v 21 You know that people¦241599 can't look at the bright \add sun\add*light in the \add #sky\add*
\q2 when the wind has come through and cleared¦241606 it.
\q1
\v 22 Gold comes¦241610 from the north¦241608. ???
\q1 Awesome majesty¦241615 surrounds God¦241613.
\q1
\v 23 We don't¦241618 know how to find the provider.
\q1 He has incredible power¦241623.
\q2 and he¦241629 doesn't violate¦241629 justice¦241624 or \add ≈his integrity\add*.
\q1
\v 24 Because of that, people¦241633 \add ≈should obey\add* him¦241632.
\q1 He doesn't \add ≈pay attention\add* to those who are wise.
