\mt2 Paul's letter to the believers in
\mt1 Philippi
\is1 Introduction
\ip Paul wrote this letter to the believers in Philippi, a province of Macedonia (Acts 16:6-40). That group of believers was the first group planted by Paul in the Roman empire in Europe, and this letter was written while he was imprisoned in Rome for his preaching of the good message about Yeshua Messiah.
\ip The main reason for Paul's writing this letter was because he wanted to thank the believers there in Philippi for the gift that they had sent to help him in prison. His second reason for writing was so that he could encourage them and strengthen their faith despite difficulties that they would face, as well as his own difficulties. Paul advised them that they need to humble themselves like Yeshua had humbled himself when he was here on the earth. He reminds them again about the goodness and mercy of God, and how their faith in Messiah saves them. It's no longer necessary for them to be constrained by the Law of Mosheh and human beliefs. Then he wrote about the peace and happiness that God gives to those united in Messiah.
\ip Note that Paul (or his scribe) regularly refer to the ‘messiah’ (Greek ‘Χριστὸς’) in this letter without a preceding article, i.e., no preceding ‘the’, thus he uses the word (which originally meant ‘chosen or anointed one’) as another name for Yeshua (rather than as a title—for example, compare ‘Governor’ with ‘the governor’), hence we capitalise it here as ‘Messiah’.

\p
\v 3 I thank¦130750 my¦130753 \nd God¦130752\nd* every¦130755 time that \add I hear\add* you¦130758 mentioned¦130757
\v 4 and every¦130761 time that I pray for you¦130767 all, I'm always¦130759 glad when I make my¦130764 requests
\v 5 because the good¦130779 message¦130779 \add united\add* us in fellowship¦130775 from the first¦130782 day¦130783 until¦130784 now.
\v 6 I'm sure of this: that the one who started a good¦130796 work in you¦130794 all will ensure that it's continued through to the day¦130800 of \add the return of\add* \nd Messiah¦130801 Yeshua\nd*.
\v 7 It's right¦130806 for me to be thinking¦130810 this about¦130811 you because¦130814 I have you all in my¦130826 heart¦130820. \add You received\add* grace¦130840 along with me so whether I'm in chains or defending¦130830 and confirming¦130832 the good¦130834 message¦130834, we are fellow¦130837 recipients.
\v 8 \nd God¦130851\nd* is my¦130847 witness¦130845 that I long for you¦130856 with all the compassions¦130858 of \nd Messiah¦130859 Yeshua\nd*.
\p
\v 9 And this is what I'm praying¦130864: that your¦130868 love¦130867 would grow more and more with knowledge¦130876 and all insight¦130879
\v 10 so that you all will approve¦130882 what's of value¦130885 and so remain sincere¦130888 and blameless until \nd Messiah¦130894\nd* \add returns\add*,
\v 11 having¦130895 been filled¦130895 with the fruit¦130896 of righteousness¦130898 through¦130901 \nd Yeshua¦130903 Messiah¦130904\nd*, honouring and¦130908 praising¦130909 \nd God¦130911\nd*.
\s1 Paul's happiness that Messiah is proclaimed
\rem /s1 Paul's Chains Advance the Gospel; Paul in prison; Paul's Present Circumstances; To Live Is Christ; Paul's Joy That Christ Is Preached
\p
\v 12 Brothers¦130916 and¦130913 sisters, I want you¦130914 to know that the good¦130925 message¦130925 has progressed¦130923 more because of what's happened to me,
\v 13 \x + \xo 1:13: \xt Acts 28:30.\x*in that my¦130930 being in chains because of \nd Messiah¦130935\nd*, has become¦130936 \add known\add* in the governor's¦130941 residence¦130941 and¦130942 to all the rest.
\v 14 Now, because of my¦130956 imprisonment, more of the brothers¦130950 and¦130946 sisters¦130950 in \nd Yahweh¦130952\nd* have become much more daring¦130958 to fearlessly¦130959 tell \add others\add* God's message¦130961.
\p
\v 15 Some do proclaim¦130981 \nd Messiah¦130979\nd* because of envy and strife¦130972, but others¦130974 do it from their good will.
\v 16 The ones proclaiming¦130990 \nd Messiah¦130989\nd* out of selfish¦130987 ambition¦130987 don't¦130991 do it sincerely, but expect that it will add to my¦130999 troubles while I'm here in chains.
\v 17 The ones who do it out of love¦131004, know that I was appointed¦131011 to defend¦131008 the good¦131010 message¦131010.
\p
\v 18 What then? I will be happy, excited even, as long as \nd Messiah¦131023\nd* is being proclaimed¦131024 in any manner¦131017, whether¦131019 their reason for doing it is suspect or in truth¦131022.
\v 19 I know that this will turn out to be my SALVATION/DELIVERANCE due to your¦131044 prayers and¦131046 from the resources of the \nd spirit¦131049\nd* of \nd Yeshua Messiah¦131052\nd*,
\rem /s1 Paul's Life for Christ
\v 20 as my eager¦131055 expectation¦131055 and hope is that I won't be ashamed¦131062 of anything, but that \nd Messiah¦131072\nd* will be magnified¦131071 by my life¦131079, always¦131068 in boldness¦131066 and even now whether¦131077 I go on to live or to die,
\v 21 because¦131084 to me, to live is to \add serve\add* \nd Messiah¦131087\nd*, and¦131088 to die¦131090 is to \add also\add* gain.
\v 22 If I continue to live in this body¦131098, I can continue in productive work, but¦131094 I don't¦131107 really know which¦131095 is my preference.
\v 23 I \add feel\add* squeezed between the two¦131114: the desire¦131116 to depart¦131122 \add from here\add* and be with \nd Messiah¦131125\nd* which would be much better¦131130,
\v 24 or to remain¦131133 on in this body¦131137, which¦131131 \add is maybe\add* more necessary¦131138 because¦131139 of all of you¦131140.
\v 25 \add Yes,\add* I'm convinced: I know that I should remain¦131146 \add in this world\add* and continue¦131148 with you all \add to assist\add* in the progress¦131155 of your¦131154 faith¦131159 and the happiness that comes from that,
\v 26 so that when I come to visit you again, \add I'll hear\add* your¦131164 pride in how you are all growing in \nd Messiah¦131167 Yeshua\nd*.
\rem /s1 Unity and witness; Live as Citizens of Heaven
\p
\v 27 Live as citizen¦131184 who are worthy¦131179 of the good message of \nd Messiah¦131183\nd*, so that whether¦131186 I'm able to come and see you all, or even if I'm absent¦131192, I'll be able to hear¦131194 everything about you all: that you're standing¦131199 firm in one spirit¦131202, with one heart¦131204 contending¦131205 together¦131205 for the faith¦131207 of the good message
\v 28 and not being¦131212 frightened¦131212 about anything because of those in opposition¦131217. That will be a sign¦131223 to them that¦131218 they \add will face\add* destruction¦131224 but you¦131227 all will \add receive\add* salvation¦131229 from \nd God¦131233\nd*,
\v 29 because it's been granted¦131237 to you on Messiah's behalf for you to believe¦131246 in him, yet also to suffer¦131252 because of him—
\v 30 \x + \xo 1:30: \xt Acts 16:19-40.\x*the same¦131254 struggle¦131255 that you¦131259 all saw¦131259 in me, and¦131263 now hear¦131265 it from me.

\s1 Messiah's humility
\rem /s1 Christ's Humility and Greatness; Unity through Humility; Imitating Christ's Humility
\p
\v 1 So if you all \add feel\add* that \nd Messiah¦131273\nd* is encouraging you on and if \add his\add* love¦131277 brings comfort and the \nd spirit¦131281\nd* brings fellowship¦131280, if anyone¦131283 feels compassion,
\v 2 then complete my¦131289 happiness by being in agreement in your thinking and being united in the same love¦131298.\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Here Paul repeats about being united in thought, but the repetition seems to only clutter his argument.\f*
\v 3 Don't do anything from selfish¦131307 ambition¦131307 or in vain conceit¦131311, but¦131312 show humility¦131314 and consider¦131316 others to be more important than yourselves,
\v 4 not just looking¦131328 out for your own \add advantage\add*, but¦131329 for what others¦131332 \add need\add*.
\rem /s1 Christ's Humility and Exaltation
\v 5 This is how you¦131341 all who are also in \nd Messiah¦131345 Yeshua\nd* should be thinking¦131338:
\v 6 Yeshua, though he was in the form of God, didn't¦131352 take advantage¦131353 of being¦131351 considered¦131354 equal¦131357 with God,
\v 7 but¦131359 emptied¦131361 himself¦131360 and¦131370 becoming¦131369 like a human, took on the form of a slave¦131363. Then¦131370 in that human form,
\v 8 he humbled¦131376 himself¦131377 and became obedient¦131379 all the way to death, even death on the stake¦131385.
\v 9 That's why \nd God¦131389\nd* highly¦131391 praised him and gave him authority over every¦131399 other authority,
\v 10 \x + \xo 2:10-11: \xt Isa 45:23 (LXX).\x*so that every¦131407 \add being\add* in heaven¦131410 and earthly¦131412 and underwater \add realms¦131414\add* will bow when \nd Yeshua¦131405\nd* is announced
\v 11 and¦131415 will honour \nd God¦131427\nd* the father¦131428 by testifying that \nd Yeshua¦131422 Messiah¦131423\nd* is \nd Yahweh¦131421\nd*.

\p
\v 12 So then, my dear friends, work towards your salvation¦131457 with fear¦131452 and¦131453 trembling¦131454—you¦131435 always¦131434 did this in my presence¦131440, so now do it much more in my absence¦131449—
\v 13 because¦131475 \nd God¦131461\nd* is the one who works in you¦131468 all to both desire and¦131472 to be living out his good¦131477 pleasure¦131477.
\p
\v 14 Do everything without¦131481 grumbling¦131482 and¦131483 arguing
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Deu 32:5.\x*so that you'll all be blameless and innocent¦131490—blameless children¦131491 of \nd God¦131492\nd* among¦131502 a generation¦131498 that's crooked¦131499 and perverted¦131501. Then you'll shine like lights¦131506 in the world¦131508,
\v 16 as you live out the message¦131509 of life¦131510, and then I'll be able to boast¦131514 when \nd Messiah¦131518\nd* \add returns\add* because¦131519 I didn't¦131520 waste my time or work for nothing,
\v 17 but even if I'm \add to lose my life by\add* being¦131532 poured¦131532 out \add like wine\add* on your sacrifice¦131535 and on the ministry¦131537 of your faith¦131539, I'll be happy and celebrate along with all of you.

\v 19 I'm hoping¦131558 in \add the\add* \nd master¦131561 Yeshua\nd* to be able to send¦131566 Timothy¦131564 to you all soon, so that I can be encouraged¦131571 when I learn what you're all up to,
\v 20 because¦131577 I have no one \add else\add* so similar to me in spirit who will be genuinely¦131581 caring¦131585 for how you're all doing.
\v 21 (There's plenty who search out what they themselves¦131590 need instead of the things of \nd Yeshua Messiah¦131597\nd*.
\v 22 But you¦131603 all know that \add Timothy\add* has proven¦131600 himself and has served¦131610 with me in the good¦131617 message¦131617 like a son serving his¦131601 father¦131606.)
\v 23 So I'll send¦131624 him as soon as I can sort out what's happening to me,
\v 24 but I'm confident in \add the\add* \nd master¦131635\nd* that I myself¦131638 will also be coming¦131641 soon.
\rem /s1 Paul Commends Epaphroditus
\p
\v 25 Meanwhile I thought it was necessary¦131644 to send¦131664 Epaphroditus¦131647 to you all. He's my brother¦131649 and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your¦131655 ambassador¦131657 and minister¦131660 to my needs.
\v 26 He's been longing¦131668 to see you all \add again\add* and was upset that you heard¦131679 that he'd been sick
\v 27 because¦131683 he nearly¦131685 died from it, but \nd God¦131690\nd* showed¦131692 mercy¦131692 to him, and not only to him but also to me that I wouldn't have yet another hardship to go through.
\v 28 So¦131709 I sent¦131710 him willingly so that when you all see him again¦131715, you'll all be very happy and I'll be less anxious¦131718 \add here\add*.
\v 29 So¦131722 accept¦131720 him in \add the\add* \nd master¦131725\nd* with gratefulness and treat him with honour¦131732,
\v 30 because he nearly died after risking his life¦131747 doing the work of \nd Messiah¦131739\nd*, but he was able to minister¦131758 to me in a way that all of you \add there\add* couldn't.

\v 2 Watch out for \add those\add* dogs, \add those\add* evil¦131783 workers¦131784, \add those\add* who say you must be circumcised,\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Although it's possible that Paul had three different groups of people in mind here, it's much more likely that he used three different names to describe the one group of people.\f*
\v 3 because¦131789 we¦131788 are the ‘circumcised¦131792’ ones—those of us with God's \nd spirit¦131795\nd* and who worship¦131798 and boast¦131800 in \nd Messiah¦131802 Yeshua\nd*. We don't¦131805 trust¦131808 in the physical \add dimension\add*,
\v 4 although¦131809 I do have confidence¦131812 even in the physical. If anyone thinks they are more qualified in terms of physical attributes, I am more so:
\v 5 \x + \xo 3:5: a \xt Rom 11:1; \xo b \xt Acts 23:6; 26:5.\x*I was circumcised¦131826 \add as a baby\add* on the eighth¦131828 day¦131828, I'm a descendent¦131830 of Yisrael \add (Israel¦131831)\add* from the tribe¦131832 of Benyamin, I'm more ‘Hebrew¦131834’ than most Hebrews¦131834, obeyed the law as member¦131839 of the Pharisee party¦131839,
\v 6 \x + \xo 3:6: \xt Acts 8:3; 22:4; 26:9-11.\x*zealously persecuted¦131843 assembled¦131845 believers, and without fault in terms of obeying the law.
\v 7 However, all of those things which¦131854 were considered advantages, now because¦131861 of \nd Messiah¦131863\nd* I consider them disadvantages.
\v 8 In fact, I consider everything to be a loss to me because knowing Messiah \nd Yeshua\nd*, my¦131883 \nd master¦131882\nd*, is superior. It's because of him that I discard everything else, considering it \add all\add* to be rubbish¦131892 so that I can gain Messiah
\v 9 and will be found¦131898 in him. I don't¦131901 gain my own righteousness by means of the law, but the righteousness that¦131906 comes through¦131911 faith in \nd Messiah¦131913\nd*—God's righteousness which¦131906 depends on faith.
\v 10 \add I want\add* to know¦131922 him and the power¦131926 that¦131921 brought him back to life, and to join with him in his sufferings¦131935, \add even\add* to be conformed¦131937 to his death¦131939,

\v 12 I haven't already received¦131954 \add that\add*, or already reached perfection¦131960, but¦131962 I'm running hard to try to grab it¦131954, in the same way that I was grabbed by \nd Messiah¦131973 Yeshua\nd*.
\v 13 Brothers¦131975 and sisters¦131975, I'm not under the illusion that I've already grabbed it¦131982, but I do do this one thing: forgetting¦131988 what's behind¦131987 me, and taking long strides towards what's ahead¦131991 of me,
\v 14 I'm running hard toward the prize¦132000 of being called up to heaven by \nd God¦132005\nd* through \nd Messiah¦132007 Yeshua\nd*.
\p
\v 15 Those of us who are mature¦132012 should think that way, and if you don't \add yet\add*, then \nd God¦132025\nd* will reveal¦132027 everything to you,

\v 9 Continue to do everything you all learnt¦132290 or received¦132292 from me, and everything you heard¦132294 or saw¦132296 in me, and the \nd God¦132303\nd* of peace¦132305 will be with you all.

\p
\v 10 I was extremely happy in \nd Yahweh¦132312\nd* once you all reestablished your consideration for my \add situation\add*. \add Well\add*, you were thinking about it, but¦132310 lacked any opportunity \add to act\add*,
\v 11 not that I'm talking¦132332 about being in poverty¦132331, because¦132334 I've learnt¦132335 to be content¦132339 in any \add situation¦132337\add*.
\v 12 I've experienced being humbled¦132344 \add with little\add*, and I've experienced having plenty, \add but\add* I've grown through every¦132349 one of those \add experiences\add*, sometimes being satisfied¦132355 and sometimes hungry, sometimes having plenty and other times not enough.
\v 13 In every \add situation\add* I stay strong¦132363 because of the \add one\add* who strengthens¦132366 me.
\p
\v 14 However¦132369, you¦132371 all did well to participate¦132372 in my¦132373 hardships.
\v 15 I've know all you Philippians¦132380, that when I left¦132387 Macedonia¦132389 to begin¦132383 \add preaching\add* the good¦132385 message¦132385, no other assembly¦132392 shared¦132393 with me in giving¦132396 and receiving¦132398—only you \add there\add*.
\v 16 \x + \xo 4:16: \xt Acts 17:1.\x*Even when I was in Thessalonica¦132407, once you¦132416 sent¦132416 me what I needed—actually twice¦132411—
\v 17 not that¦132426 I was looking¦132419 for a gift¦132421 \add from my perspective\add*, but¦132422 because I was thrilled to see you¦132430 all accumulating \add heavenly\add* rewards.
\v 18 \x + \xo 4:18: \xt Exo 29:18.\x*But \add now\add* I've received¦132438 everything \add I need\add*. I have plenty¦132435 now that Epaphroditus¦132441 arrived with what you¦132444 all sent. It was like a fragrant¦132447 sacrifice¦132448 that's acceptable¦132449 to \nd God¦132452\nd* and¦132434 which pleases¦132450 him.
\v 19 My¦132456 \nd God¦132455\nd* will meet all of your¦132460 needs from his¦132466 riches¦132464 in heaven in \nd Messiah¦132470 Yeshua¦132471\nd*—
\v 20 may our¦132477 \nd God¦132474\nd* and¦132475 father¦132476 be honoured throughout all the ages.
