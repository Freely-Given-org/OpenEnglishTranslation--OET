\mt2 Paul's letter to the believers in
\mt1 Philippi
\is1 Introduction
\ip Paul wrote this letter to the believers in Philippi, a province of Macedonia (Acts 16:6-40). That group of believers was the first group planted by Paul in the Roman empire in Europe, and this letter was written while he was imprisoned in Rome for his preaching of the good message about Yeshua Messiah.
\ip The main reason for Paul's writing this letter was because he wanted to thank the believers there in Philippi for the gift that they had sent to help him in prison. His second reason for writing was so that he could encourage them and strengthen their faith despite difficulties that they would face, as well as his own difficulties. Paul advised them that they need to humble themselves like Yeshua had humbled himself when he was here on the earth. He reminds them again about the goodness and mercy of God, and how their faith in Messiah saves them. It's no longer necessary for them to be constrained by the Law of Mosheh and human beliefs. Then he wrote about the peace and happiness that God gives to those united in Messiah.
\ip Note that Paul (or his scribe) regularly refer to the ‘messiah’ (Greek ‘Χριστὸς’) in this letter without a preceding article, i.e., no preceding ‘the’, thus he uses the word (which originally meant ‘chosen or anointed one’) as another name for Yeshua (rather than as a title—for example, compare ‘Governor’ with ‘the governor’), hence we capitalise it here as ‘Messiah’.

\p
\v 3 I thank¦131697 my¦131700 \nd God¦131699\nd* every¦131702 time that \add I hear\add* you¦131705 mentioned¦131704
\v 4 and every¦131708 time that I pray for you¦131714 all, I'm always¦131706 glad when I make my¦131711 requests
\v 5 because the good¦131726 message¦131726 \add united\add* us in fellowship¦131722 from the first¦131729 day¦131730 until¦131731 now.
\v 6 I'm sure of this: that the one who started a good¦131743 work in you¦131741 all will ensure that it's continued through to the day¦131747 of \add the return of\add* \nd Messiah¦131748 Yeshua¦131749\nd*.
\v 7 It's right¦131753 for me to be thinking¦131757 this about¦131758 you because¦131761 I have you all in my¦131773 heart¦131767. \add You received\add* grace¦131787 along with me so whether I'm in chains or defending¦131777 and confirming¦131779 the good¦131781 message¦131781, we are fellow¦131784 recipients.
\v 8 \nd God¦131798\nd* is my¦131794 witness¦131792 that I long for you¦131803 with all the compassions¦131805 of \nd Messiah¦131806 Yeshua¦131807\nd*.
\p
\v 9 And this is what I'm praying¦131811: that your¦131815 love¦131814 would grow more and more with knowledge¦131823 and all insight¦131826
\v 10 so that you all will approve¦131829 what's of value¦131832 and so remain sincere¦131835 and blameless until \nd Messiah¦131841\nd* \add returns\add*,

\s1 Paul's happiness that Messiah is proclaimed
\rem /s1 Paul's Chains Advance the Gospel; Paul in prison; Paul's Present Circumstances; To Live Is Christ; Paul's Joy That Christ Is Preached
\p
\v 12 Brothers¦131863 and sisters, I want you¦131861 to know that the good¦131872 message¦131872 has progressed¦131870 more because of what's happened to me,
\v 13 \x + \xo 1:13: \xt Acts 28:30.\x*in that my¦131877 being in chains because of \nd Messiah¦131882\nd*, has become¦131883 \add known\add* in the governor's¦131888 residence¦131888 and¦131889 to all the rest.
\v 14 Now, because of my¦131903 imprisonment, more of the brothers¦131897 and¦131893 sisters¦131897 in the \nd master¦131899\nd* have become much more daring¦131905 to fearlessly¦131906 tell \add others\add* God's message¦131908.
\p
\v 15 Some do proclaim¦131928 \nd Messiah¦131926\nd* because of envy and strife¦131919, but others¦131921 do it from their good will.
\v 16 The ones proclaiming¦131937 \nd Messiah¦131936\nd* out of selfish¦131934 ambition¦131934 don't¦131938 do it sincerely, but expect that it will add to my¦131946 troubles while I'm here in chains.
\v 17 The ones who do it out of love¦131951, know that I was appointed¦131958 to defend¦131955 the good¦131957 message¦131957.
\p
\v 18 What then? I will be happy, excited even, as long as \nd Messiah¦131970\nd* is being proclaimed¦131971 in any manner¦131964, whether¦131966 their reason for doing it is suspect or in truth¦131969.
\v 19 I know that this will turn out to be my SALVATION/DELIVERANCE due to your¦131991 prayers and¦131993 from the resources of the \nd spirit¦131996\nd* of \nd Yeshua¦131998 Messiah¦131999\nd*,
\rem /s1 Paul's Life for Christ
\v 20 as my eager¦132002 expectation¦132002 and hope is that I won't be ashamed¦132009 of anything, but that \nd Messiah¦132019\nd* will be magnified¦132018 by my life¦132026, always¦132015 in boldness¦132013 and even now whether¦132024 I go on to live or to die,
\v 21 because¦132031 to me, to live is to \add serve\add* \nd Messiah¦132034\nd*, and¦132035 to die¦132037 is to \add also\add* gain.
\v 22 If I continue to live in this body¦132045, I can continue in productive work, but¦132041 I don't¦132054 really know which¦132042 is my preference.
\v 23 I \add feel\add* squeezed between the two¦132061: the desire¦132063 to depart¦132069 \add from here\add* and be with \nd Messiah¦132072\nd* which would be much better¦132077,
\v 24 or to remain¦132080 on in this body¦132084, which¦132078 \add is maybe\add* more necessary¦132085 because¦132086 of all of you¦132087.
\v 25 \add Yes,\add* I'm convinced: I know that I should remain¦132093 \add in this world\add* and continue¦132095 with you all \add to assist\add* in the progress¦132102 of your¦132101 faith¦132106 and the happiness that comes from that,
\v 26 so that when I come to visit you again¦132122, \add I'll hear\add* your¦132111 pride in how you are all growing in \nd Messiah¦132114 Yeshua¦132115\nd*.
\rem /s1 Unity and witness; Live as Citizens of Heaven
\p
\v 27 Live as citizen¦132131 who're worthy¦132126 of the good message of \nd Messiah¦132130\nd*, so that whether¦132133 I'm able to come and see you all, or even if I'm absent¦132139, I'll be able to hear¦132141 everything about you all: that you're standing¦132146 firm in one spirit¦132149, with one heart¦132151 contending¦132152 together¦132152 for the faith¦132154 of the good message
\v 28 and not being¦132159 frightened¦132159 about anything because of those in opposition¦132164. That will be a sign¦132170 to them that they \add will face\add* destruction¦132171 but you¦132174 all will \add receive\add* salvation¦132176 from \nd God¦132180\nd*,
\v 29 because it's been granted¦132184 to you on Messiah's behalf for you to believe¦132193 in him, yet also to suffer¦132199 because of him—
\v 30 \x + \xo 1:30: \xt Acts 16:19-40.\x*the same¦132201 struggle¦132202 that you¦132206 all saw¦132206 in me, and¦132210 now hear¦132212 it from me.

\s1 Messiah's humility
\rem /s1 Christ's Humility and Greatness; Unity through Humility; Imitating Christ's Humility
\p
\v 1 So if you all \add feel\add* that \nd Messiah¦132220\nd* is encouraging you on and if \add his\add* love¦132224 brings comfort and the \nd spirit¦132228\nd* brings fellowship¦132227, if anyone¦132230 feels compassion,
\v 2 then complete my¦132236 happiness by being in agreement in your thinking and being united in the same love¦132245.\f + \fr 2:2 \ft Here Paul repeats about being united in thought, but the repetition seems to only clutter his argument.\f*
\v 3 Don't do anything from selfish¦132254 ambition¦132254 or in vain conceit¦132258, but¦132259 show humility¦132261 and consider¦132263 others to be more important than yourselves,
\v 4 not just looking¦132275 out for your own \add advantage\add*, but¦132276 for what others¦132279 \add need\add*.
\rem /s1 Christ's Humility and Exaltation
\v 5 This is how you¦132288 all who are also in \nd Messiah¦132292 Yeshua¦132293\nd* should be thinking¦132285:
\v 6 Yeshua, though he was in the form of God, didn't take advantage¦132300 of being¦132298 considered¦132301 equal¦132304 with God,
\v 7 but¦132306 emptied¦132308 himself¦132307 and becoming¦132316 like a human, took on the form of a slave¦132310. Then¦132317 in that human form,
\v 8 he humbled¦132323 himself¦132324 and became obedient¦132326 all the way to death, even death on the stake¦132332.
\v 9 That's why \nd God¦132336\nd* highly¦132338 praised him and gave him authority over every¦132346 other authority,
\v 10 \x + \xo 2:10-11: \xt Isa 45:23 (LXX).\x*so that every¦132354 \add being\add* in heaven¦132357 and earthly¦132359 and underwater \add realms\add* will bow when \nd Yeshua¦132352\nd* is announced
\v 11 and¦132362 will honour \nd God¦132374\nd* the father¦132375 by testifying that the \nd master¦132368\nd* is \nd Yeshua¦132369 Messiah¦132370\nd*.

\p
\v 12 So then, my dear friends, work towards your salvation¦132404 with fear¦132399 and¦132400 trembling¦132401—you¦132382 always¦132381 did this in my presence¦132387, so now do it much more in my absence¦132396—
\v 13 because¦132422 \nd God¦132408\nd* is the one who works in you¦132415 all to both desire and¦132419 to be living out his good¦132424 pleasure¦132424.
\p
\v 14 Do everything without¦132428 grumbling¦132429 and¦132430 arguing
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Deu 32:5.\x*so that you'll all be blameless and innocent¦132437—blameless children¦132438 of \nd God¦132439\nd* among¦132449 a generation¦132445 that's crooked¦132446 and perverted¦132448. Then you'll shine like lights¦132453 in the world¦132455,
\v 16 as you live out the message¦132456 of life¦132457, and then I'll be able to boast¦132461 when \nd Messiah¦132465\nd* \add returns\add* because¦132466 I didn't waste my time or work for nothing,
\v 17 but even if I'm \add to lose my life by\add* being¦132479 poured¦132479 out \add like wine\add* on your sacrifice¦132482 and on the ministry¦132484 of your faith¦132486, I'll be happy and celebrate along with all of you.

\p
\v 19 I'm hoping¦132502 in the \nd master¦132505 Yeshua¦132507\nd* to be able to send¦132510 Timothy¦132508 to you all soon, so that I can be encouraged¦132515 when I learn what you're all up to,
\v 20 because¦132521 I have no one \add else\add* so similar to me in spirit who will be genuinely¦132525 caring¦132529 for how you're all doing.
\v 21 (There's plenty who search out what they themselves¦132534 need instead of the things of \nd Yeshua¦132540 Messiah¦132541\nd*.
\v 22 But you¦132547 all know that \add Timothy\add* has proven¦132544 himself and has served¦132554 with me in the good¦132561 message¦132561 like a son serving his¦132545 father¦132550.)
\v 23 So I'll send¦132568 him as soon as I can sort out what's happening to me,
\v 24 but I'm confident in the \nd master¦132579\nd* that I myself¦132582 will also be coming¦132585 soon.
\rem /s1 Paul Commends Epaphroditus
\p
\v 25 Meanwhile I thought it was necessary¦132588 to send¦132608 Epaphroditus¦132591 to you all. He's my brother¦132593 and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your¦132599 ambassador¦132601 and minister¦132604 to my needs.
\v 26 He's been longing¦132612 to see you all \add again\add* and was upset that you heard¦132623 that he'd been sick
\v 27 because¦132627 he nearly¦132629 died from it, but \nd God¦132634\nd* showed¦132636 mercy¦132636 to him, and not only to him but also to me that I wouldn't have yet another hardship to go through.
\v 28 So¦132653 I sent¦132654 him willingly so that when you all see him again¦132659, you'll all be very happy and I'll be less anxious¦132662 \add here\add*.
\v 29 So¦132666 accept¦132664 him in the \nd master¦132669\nd* with gratefulness and treat him with honour¦132676,
\v 30 because he nearly died after risking his life¦132691 doing the work of \nd Messiah¦132683\nd*, but he was able to minister¦132703 to me in a way that all of you \add there\add* couldn't.

\v 2 Watch out for \add those\add* dogs, \add those\add* evil¦132728 workers¦132729, \add those\add* who say you must be circumcised,\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Although it's possible that Paul had three different groups of people in mind here, it's much more likely that he used three different names to describe the one group of people.\f*
\v 3 because¦132734 we¦132733 are the ‘circumcised¦132737’ ones—those of us with God's \nd spirit¦132740\nd* and who worship¦132743 and boast¦132745 in \nd Messiah¦132747 Yeshua¦132748\nd*. We don't¦132750 trust¦132753 in the physical \add dimension\add*,
\v 4 although¦132754 I do have confidence¦132757 even in the physical. If anyone thinks they are more qualified in terms of physical attributes, I am more so:
\v 5 \x + \xo 3:5: a \xt Rom 11:1; \xo b \xt Acts 23:6; 26:5.\x*I was circumcised¦132771 \add as a baby\add* on the eighth¦132773 day¦132773, I'm a descendent¦132775 of Israel¦132776 from the tribe¦132777 of Benyamin, I'm more ‘Hebrew¦132779’ than most Hebrews¦132779, obeyed the law as member¦132784 of the Pharisee¦132784 party¦132784,
\v 6 \x + \xo 3:6: \xt Acts 8:3; 22:4; 26:9-11.\x*zealously persecuted¦132788 assembled¦132790 believers, and without fault in terms of obeying the law.
\v 7 However, all of those things which¦132799 were considered advantages, now because¦132806 of \nd Messiah¦132808\nd* I consider them disadvantages.
\v 8 In fact, I consider everything to be a loss to me because knowing Messiah \nd Yeshua¦132825\nd*, my¦132829 \nd master¦132828\nd*, is superior. It's because of him that I discard everything else, considering it \add all\add* to be rubbish¦132838 so that I can gain Messiah
\v 9 and will be found¦132844 in him. I don't¦132847 gain my own righteousness by means of the law, but the righteousness that comes through¦132857 faith in \nd Messiah¦132859\nd*—God's righteousness which¦132852 depends on faith.
\v 10 \add I want\add* to know¦132868 him and the power¦132872 that brought him back to life, and to join with him in his sufferings¦132881, \add even\add* to be conformed¦132883 to his death¦132886,

\p
\v 10 I was extremely happy in the \nd master¦133261\nd* once you all reestablished your consideration for my \add situation\add*. \add Well\add*, you were thinking about it, but¦133259 lacked any opportunity \add to act\add*,
\v 11 not that I'm talking¦133281 about being in poverty¦133280, because¦133283 I've learnt¦133284 to be content¦133288 in any \add situation\add*.
\v 12 I've experienced being humbled¦133293 \add with little\add*, and I've experienced having plenty, \add but\add* I've grown through every¦133298 one of those \add experiences\add*, sometimes being satisfied¦133304 and sometimes hungry, sometimes having plenty and other times not enough.
\v 13 In every \add situation\add* I stay strong¦133312 because of the \add one\add* who strengthens¦133315 me.
\p
\v 14 However¦133318, you¦133320 all did well to participate¦133321 in my¦133322 hardships.
\v 15 I've know all you Philippians¦133329, that when I left¦133336 Macedonia¦133338 to begin¦133332 \add preaching\add* the good¦133334 message¦133334, no other assembly¦133341 shared¦133342 with me in giving¦133345 and receiving¦133347—only you \add there\add*.
\v 16 \x + \xo 4:16: \xt Acts 17:1.\x*Even when I was in Thessalonica¦133356, once you¦133365 sent¦133365 me what I needed—actually twice¦133360—
\v 17 not that I was looking¦133368 for a gift¦133370 \add from my perspective\add*, but¦133371 because I was thrilled to see you¦133379 all accumulating \add heavenly\add* rewards.
\v 18 \x + \xo 4:18: \xt Exo 29:18.\x*But \add now\add* I've received¦133387 everything \add I need\add*. I have plenty¦133384 now that Epaphroditus¦133390 arrived with what you¦133393 all sent. It was like a fragrant¦133396 sacrifice¦133397 that's acceptable¦133398 to \nd God¦133401\nd* and¦133383 which pleases¦133399 him.
\v 19 My¦133405 \nd God¦133404\nd* will meet all of your¦133409 needs from his¦133415 riches¦133413 in heaven in \nd Messiah¦133419 Yeshua¦133420\nd*—
\v 20 may our¦133426 \nd God¦133423\nd* and¦133424 father¦133425 be honoured throughout all the ages.
