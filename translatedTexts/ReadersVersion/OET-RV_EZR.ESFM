\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk The account of Ezra\bk*, is like a continuation of \bk The Chronicles\bk*—it tells us about the returning home of other Jews who had been taken to Babylon as captives, and the restoration of daily life in Yerushalem (Jerusalem) and of worshipping at the temple. 
\ip It's divided into three main sections: 1.) The declaration of King Koresh (Cyrus) of Persia (Heb. Paras) to allow a group of exiled Jews to return to Yerushalem from Babylon. 2.) The rebuilding of the temple and its dedication, and the return to worshipping Yahweh there in Yerushalem. 3.) The return of a different group of Jewish descendants to Yerushalem under the leadership of Ezra—the one knowledgable about God's instructions. He assisted the Israelis to return to their beliefs and customs, so that their worshipping of the true God wouldn't be forgotten.

\v 15 \add Firstly,\add* I gathered¦220479 them \add ≈near\add* the river¦220482 that goes to Ahava¦220486, and we camped¦220487 there for three¦220490 days¦220489. I \add ≈interviewed\add* the people¦220492 and the priests¦220493 and \add ≈discovered that we didn't have any Levites included\add* \add in the group\add*.
\v 16 \add ≈So¦220501 I summoned\add* the following leaders¦220511: Eliezer¦220502, Ariel¦220503, Shemayah¦220504, Elnatan, Yarib¦220506, \add a second\add* Elnatan, Natan¦220508, Zekaryah, and Meshullam¦220510, as well as the wise men: Yoyariv and \add a third\add* Elnatan.
\v 17 I commanded them to go to Iddo, the leader¦220522 at Kasifya, and I \add ≈told them to tell\add* Iddo and his relatives (temple servants in Kasifya) to send us \add @some Levites\add* who would \add go to Yerushalem to\add* serve in our God's \add ≈temple\add*.
\v 18 \add ≈Then¦220544 since¦220546 we had God's¦220561 favour\add*, they sent us a \add ≈talented\add* man¦220551 (from the sons of Mahli¦220554, son of Levi¦220557, son of Israel¦220560) and eighteen¦220564 of his¦220563 sons and \add ≈other relatives\add*.

\v 21 Then¦220594 \add right\add* there¦220595 by the river¦220599 Ahava¦220600, I proclaimed¦220594 a fast to humble¦220601 ourselves \add ≈in front¦220602 of\add* our God¦220603 to \add ≈request that he'd smooth the\add* way \add ahead\add* for us, and for our children¦220609, and for all our property,

\v 23 \add ≈So¦220646\add* we fasted¦220646 and sought \add wisdom\add* from our God¦220648 concerning this, and he \add ≈listened¦220652 to our requests\add*.

\p
\v 24 Then¦220655 I chose twelve of the leaders of the priests¦220657 along¦220660 with Sherevyah and Hashavyah and ten of the other Levites,
\v 25 and \add as they watched,\add* I weighed¦220666 out the gold¦220675 and silver¦220672, and the \add valuable\add* utensils—the offering for the house¦220680 of our¦220682 God¦220682 that the king¦220684, and his counsellors¦220685 and officials, and all the \add ≈exiled Israelis who could be contacted\add*, had offered.
\v 26 \add ≈It came to\add* three tonnes of gold¦220707, twenty-one tonnes of silver, and another three tonnes of silver containers,
\v 27 as well as twenty¦220713 gold bowls¦220711 that weighed another eight kilograms, and two polished bronze¦220717 containers that were as valuable as gold.
\p
\v 28 “You are sacred to Yahweh,” I told them all, “and the \add ≈containers and utensils\add* are sacred, and the gold¦220732 and silver¦220731 are a freewill¦220733 offering¦220733 to Yahweh, the God¦220735 of your¦220736 ancestors¦220736.

\v 30 So¦220756 the priests¦220757 and the Levites¦220758 \add ≈accepted\add* the \add ≈receipt\add* of the gold¦220761 and silver¦220760, and the containers, to take them to Yerushalem¦220764—to the house¦220765 of our¦220766 God¦220766.

\v 35 The \add ≈descendants of the former captives¦220842 who had returned from\add* exile¦220845 offered burnt offerings to Israel's¦220850 God¦220849: twelve bulls¦220851 for all Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs¦220864, then twelve male goats for a sin¦220868 offering.
