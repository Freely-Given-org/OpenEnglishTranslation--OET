# Open English Translation Readers’ Version (OET-RV)

## Introduction

The _OET Reader’s Version_ is manually translated from the _OET Literal Version_
which is a word-for-word translation of the original Hebrew and Greek
where the words have been minimally reordered to make sense in English.

This translation methodology is based on the idea that it’s easier
to try to focus on creating a draft that’s natural English
and then to fix accuracy and consistency issues later, rather than the opposite.
There are so many Bible translations in the world,
including in English,
where the grammar and expressions of the translation are much more like Hebrew or Greek styles than being natural in the language that they’re being translated into.
For instance in modern English, it's far more natural for any non-churched person to say
‘God's kingdom’ than ‘kingdom of God’.

Currently (mid-2025), over 67% of the 66 books have been rough-drafted.

## TODO list

- Replace "whoever" with anyone
- Manually mark nomina sacra in OET-RV???
- Consider replacing J with Y, e.g., Jacob -> Yacob, John -> Yohan
- Consider changing names still quite recognisable with only one letter difference, e.g., Lazarus -> Lazaros
- Finish changing 'followers' to ‘apprentices’ where appropriate
- Check consistency of keyterms, e.g., how is ‘son of God’, ‘holy spirit’, ‘kingdom of the heavens’ translated everywhere?
- Compare parallel passages and choose the best renderings
- Define and check style of s1 section headings, i.e., tense, perfects, etc.
- Define and implement footnote classes
- Add word numbers for all remaining OET-RV words

### ‘Add’ classes

We use USFM \add markers but need to differentiate further—probably by using an additional symbol inside the marked-up text (similarly to what we do for the OET-LV). Some possibilities are:

- grammatical additions, e.g., replacing a pronoun with the (obvious) referrent (or vice versa)
- cultural additions, e.g., \add Roman\add* soldier
- contextual additions, e.g., and \add after that\add* he said
- application/interpretational additions, e.g., when we reword the concept to what we think the author was trying to say, but the final words that we use are not there at all in the original.

See our [formats page](https://OpenEnglishTranslation.Bible/Resources/Formats) for more information on how these things are implemented.

## Schedule

As of July 2025, about 2/3 of the Bible has been drafted. ([This page](https://OpenEnglishTranslation.Bible) is updated a few times per month with the progress.) Our goal is to complete the first draft and first check of the _OET_ by mid-2026.

## The inevitable event

It is my request to my family and executors of my will to place all of this work into the public domain, finished or unfinished, on the event of my death.
It has always been my desire that the _Open English Translation_ be a gift to the world, including the _Literal Version_, the _Readers’ Version_,
and any other versions made under my control or under the auspices of [Freely-Given.org](https://Freely-Given.org).

Please note that any contributions by others to this project will only be accepted on these same grounds.
