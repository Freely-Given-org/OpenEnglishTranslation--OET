\mt2 The first summary of the
\mt1 Kings of Yisrael and Yehudah
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk The first summary of the kings of Yisrael/Israel and Yehudah/Judah\bk* is a continuation of the account about the kingdom of Israeli started in the account by \bk Shemuel\bk*. It's divided into three main parts: 1. Shelomoh (Solomon) takes over as king of the nation of Yisrael after the death of his father David. 2. Shelomoh's kingdom and his prosperity, especially his construction of the temple in Yerushalem. 3. The kingdom of Yisrael becoming split into two: the northern kingdom (which goes on to continue to be called Israel), and the southern kingdom (named Yehudah after the largest of its two tribes), and the accounts about the kings who led them through until around 950 before Yeshua/Jesus (B.C.)
\ip Here in the first of the two \bk Summaries of the kings of Yisrael and Yehudah\bk*, each leader is evaluated according to their obedience of God's instructions, and the prosperity of their entire nations depends of that. Worshipping of false gods and the disobedience of God's instructions would lead to destruction. The northern kings failed this testing and didn't prosper, whereas the southern kingdom did have some good leaders and so had times of prosperity.
\ip Also revealed in \bk The first summary of the kings of Yisrael and Yehudah\bk*, are God's prophets who brought messages from Yahweh—often warning them against the worshipping of false gods and against disobeying God. The most famous of those in this document is Eliyyah (Elijah) and the account about his opposition to Baal's prophets (chapter 18).

\v 11 Then¦155765 Natan¦155766 \add ≈asked\add* Shelomoh's mother¦155772 Batsheva, “Haven't you¦155777 heard¦155777 that Haggit's¦155783 son Adoniyyah \add ≈has made himself king¦155779\add*, and¦155784 our¦155784 master¦155784 David¦155785 doesn't \add even\add* \add ≈realise\add*?\x + \xo 1:11: \xt 2Sam 12:24.\x*
\v 12 \add ≈So¦155789\add* please¦155792 let me advise you now \add ≈so that you can save your own life and that of your son Shelomoh\add* \add (Solomon¦155802)\add*.
\v 13 Go and \add ≈ask\add* King David¦155810, ‘My master¦155816 the king, didn't¦155813 you promise your female¦155819 servant, saying, “Surely your son Shelomoh will reign¦155825 after¦155826 me, and he will sit on my throne¦155831?” \add ≈So why has Adoniyyah become¦155833 king\add*?’

\p
\v 15 \add ≈So¦155852\add* Batsheva \add ≈went¦155852 to the king's bedroom where\add* Avishag (the Shunammite¦155864) was attending \add *him\add* \add ≈in his old age\add*.
\v 16 Batsheva¦155871 bowed¦155870 \add ≈low to show respect\add* to the king, and he \add ≈asked her what she wanted\add*.
\p
\v 17 “My master¦155884,” she \add ≈replied\add*, “you yourself \add ≈promised\add* to your female servant¦155889 \add ≈in front of\add* your God¦155888 Yahweh¦155884 that your son Shelomoh \add ≈would be the one to reign¦155894 after¦155895 you and sit¦155897 on your\add* throne¦155900.
\v 18 \add ≈But¦155902\add* now, listen, Adoniyyah¦155904 \add ≈has become¦155905 king\add* \add instead\add*, and you \add ≈haven't even been told about it\add*.
\v 19 He's sacrificing¦155912 \add ≈many\add* oxen and calves and sheep¦155916, and he invited¦155931 the priest¦155924 Evyatar, and Yoav¦155925 the commander¦155926 of the army, and all your sons¦155921 \add ≈except for\add* your servant¦155929 Shelomoh.

\p
\v 22 \add ≈Just\add* then, while she was still¦155968 talking¦155969 with the king, the prophet¦155974 Natan¦155973 \add ≈appeared\add*

\v 24 Then¦155993 \add *he\add* \add ≈asked\add*, “My master¦155995 the king¦155996, \add ≈did you announce that Adoniyyah will reign¦156000 after¦156001 you and sit¦156003 on your\add* throne¦156006?

\p
\v 28 Then King David¦156077 said¦156078, “Call Batsheva \add back in\add*.” \add ≈So\add* she came¦156085 \add back\add* into the king's \add room\add* and stood¦156088 in front of \add *him\add*.
\v 29 Then¦156092 the king¦156093 \add ≈promised\add*, “As¦156101 Yahweh¦156097 lives \add ≈and¦156094 has rescued me from every danger\add*,

\p
\v 31 Batsheva \add ≈knelt down and bowed¦156134 her face¦156138 to the floor\add* and said, “May my master¦156144, the king David¦156146 live \add ≈forever\add*.”
\p
\v 32 Then King David¦156153 \add ≈called out\add*, “\add ≈Summon\add* Tsadok¦156157 the priest¦156158 for me, and Natan¦156159 the prophet¦156160, and Yehoyada's son Benayah¦156161.” \add ≈So\add* they¦156165 came¦156165 \add ≈into the king's room\add*.
\v 33 “Take some of \add *my\add* servants¦156176,” the king¦156170 \add ≈instructed\add* them. “and put my son Shelomoh on my mule and lead him to the Gihon¦156193 \add Spring\add*.
\v 34 Then \add you two,\add* Tsadok¦156198 and Natan¦156200, must anoint¦156195 him there¦156197 as king over Yisrael¦156205. Then blow the horn and \add ≈shout\add*, ‘Let King Shelomoh live!’
\v 35 Then \add ≈follow him back here where he must\add* come¦156215 and sit¦156216 on my throne¦156219. Then he'll reign¦156221 in my place¦156222 as ruler¦156226 of Yisrael¦156229 and Yehudah¦156232.”
\p
\v 36 “\add ≈Certainly\add*,” Benayah¦156235 replied. “Just as Yahweh¦156249, the God¦156248 of my master¦156249 the king has instructed.
\v 37 Just as Yahweh¦156257 has been with my master the king, so may he be with Shelomoh. And may \add ≈his rule be\add* \add even\add* greater¦156265 than \add *that\add* of my master, the king David¦156272.”
\p
\v 38 \add ≈So¦156274\add* Tsadok¦156275 the priest¦156276 and Natan¦156277 the prophet¦156278 and Yehoyada's son Benayah¦156279 and the \add ≈kings bodyguards\add* went and put Shelomoh on the king's mule, and took him to Gihon¦156298.
\v 39 Tsadok¦156301 the priest¦156302 took¦156300 the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed¦156310 Shelomoh \add with it\add*, and they¦156316 blew the horn and all the people¦156319 \add ≈shouted\add*, “Let King Shelomoh live¦156320!”
\v 40 Then¦156324 all the people \add ≈followed\add* him \add back\add* uphill \add to the city\add*, and the people were playing¦156330 flutes¦156330 and were \add ≈so exuberant in their¦156337 celebrations that the ground shook¦156335 with the noise¦156337\add*.
\p
\v 41 \add ≈When\add* Adoniyyah and all \add ≈his invited guests¦156343\add* had finished¦156347 eating¦156348, they heard the noise, and Yoav¦156350 heard the sound of the horn and \add ≈asked\add*, “\add ≈What's all that commotion in\add* the city¦156359?”
\v 42 He was still speaking¦156363 when Yonatan the son of Evyatar the priest¦156369 \add suddenly turned up\add*, and Adoniyyah \add ≈called\add* \add >him\add*, “Come \add over here\add* because you're a \add ≈good fellow\add* and you'll bring good news¦156379.”
\p
\v 43 “\add Actually, no,\add*” Yonatan answered¦156381. “Our master¦156386 the king David¦156389 has \add just\add* made Shelomoh \add ≈king\add*.
\v 44 The king sent¦156395 Tsadok¦156401 the priest¦156402 and Natan¦156405 the prophet¦156406 and Yehoyada's son Benayah¦156407 and the \add ≈king's bodyguards\add*, and they placed \add @Shelomoh\add* on the king's mule.
\v 45 Then¦156419 Tsadok¦156421 and Natan¦156423 anointed¦156419 him as king¦156425 at Gihon¦156426. \add Now\add* they've \add ≈gone back\add* from there¦156428 \add ≈cheering\add* \add all the way\add*, and the \add whole\add* city¦156431 is \add happily\add* \add ≈celebrating\add*.

\v 46 \add ≈What's more\add*, Shelomoh's sitting on the royal¦156442 throne¦156441 \add right now\add*.
\v 47 \add ≈As well as that\add*, the king's servants¦156447 \add ≈went in\add* to bless our master¦156452 the king David¦156454, saying, ‘May God make Shelomoh's \add ≈reputation\add* \add even\add* better than yours, and may he make his \add ≈reign\add* \add even\add* greater¦156464 than yours.’ Then¦156444 the king in his bed, bowed¦156469 down
\v 48 and said¦156478, ‘Blessed be Yisrael's¦156483 God¦156482 Yahweh¦156481 who has \add ≈provided\add* \add a son\add* to sit on my throne¦156490 today, and \add ≈I've been able to see it\add* \add before my death\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 49 Then¦156494 all Adoniyyah's¦156500 invited guests¦156498 started trembling¦156494, and they all got up and \add ≈quietly slipped back to their homes\add*.
\v 50 Adoniyyah \add himself\add* was now afraid¦156506 of what Shelomoh would do, \add ≈so\add* he went¦156510 \add to the sacred tent\add* and held on to the horns¦156512 of the altar¦156513.
\v 51 Shelomoh was told, “Listen, Adoniyyah \add ≈is afraid of the new king because\add* he's grabbed the horns¦156527 of the altar¦156528 and said, ‘Let Shelomoh the king promise me as soon as \add ≈possible\add*, that he won't \add ≈execute\add* his servant¦156541 with the sword¦156542.’ ”
\p
\v 52 “If he \add ≈shows himself as a loyal subject\add*,” Shelomoh \add ≈responded¦156544\add*, “\add ≈then he'll be able to keep his head\add*. \add ≈But¦156544\add* if \add ≈he's found¦156559 to be a traitor\add*, then he'll die¦156562.”

\p
\v 6 Then¦164111 King Rehavam consulted¦164111 with the elders¦164116 (who'd \add ≈served\add* his father¦164125 Shelomoh while he was alive¦164127), asking them for advice on how to respond.
\p
\v 7 “If you \add ≈want to serve these people¦164152 well\add*,” they replied¦164140, “answer¦164155 them \add ≈with kindness now\add* then they'll \add ≈serve you well in the future\add*.”
\p
\v 8 \add ≈However¦164168 he decided to ignore that advice from\add* the elders¦164171, and he consulted¦164174 with the young men who were standing \add ≈in front of him\add* and that he'd grown¦164179 up with,

\p
\v 10 “You should tell \add *them\add* this,” \add ≈his young companions replied\add*. “\add ≈They've asked that you should lighten¦164232 the load on them from what your father demanded, but on the contrary, you should tell them that your little¦164237 finger¦164237 is thicker¦164238 than your father's thigh bone was\add*.

\v 12 \add ≈So¦164262 when\add* Yarave'am¦164264 and all the \add ≈leaders\add* came \add back\add* to \add King\add* Rehavam on the third day as \add *he'd\add* \add ≈instructed them\add*,

\v 1 At that time¦165504, \add one of\add* Yarave'am's sons, Aviyyah, became¦165506 very sick¦165506
\v 2 and Yarave'am¦165513 told his wife, “\add ≈Go and get changed so that no one will recognise you as\add* \add *my\add* wife. Then¦165512 go to Shiloh¦165527 where the prophet Ahiyyah is—he's \add ≈the one who prophesied that I'd become¦165537 king¦165537\add*.
\v 3 Take ten¦165545 loaves of bread¦165546 and \add some\add* cakes¦165547 and a jar of honey¦165549 to give to him. He'll tell you¦165544 what will happen¦165557 to the boy¦165558.”
\p
\v 4 \add ≈So¦165560\add* \add *his\add* wife¦165562 \add ≈got ready\add* and went¦165565 to Ahiyyah's house¦165568 at Shiloh¦165566. Ahiyyah was \add ≈now very elderly and\add* not able to see¦165574,
\v 5 \add ≈but\add* Yahweh had told \add *him\add*, “Listen, Yarave'am's wife¦165587 will be coming to \add ≈ask for your guidance\add* about¦165589 her son, because he's sick¦165598. \add ≈I want you to tell her so-and-so. And when she comes, she won't be dressed like a queen\add*.”
\p
\v 6 \add ≈So¦165609\add* as soon as Ahiyyah heard¦165610 her¦165615 \add ≈walk through the doorway\add*, he said¦165618, “Come in, wife¦165620 of Yarave'am¦165621. Why \add ≈did you get changed like that\add*? Now I've been \add ≈instructed to pass bad news¦165629 onto\add* you—
\v 7 go \add back\add* and \add ≈give Yarave'am¦165633 this message from\add* Yisrael's¦165639 God¦165638 Yahweh¦165637, ‘I \add ≈chose you out from\add* the people and \add ≈placed\add* you as a leader over my people Yisrael,
\v 8 and I tore the kingdom¦165654 away from \add ≈David's¦165656 descendants\add* and gave¦165657 it to you. \add ≈But¦165651\add* you haven't been like my servant¦165662 David who \add ≈obeyed my instructions and followed me with integrity—only doing¦165674 what he knew that I approved of\add*.
\v 9 \add ≈However,\add* you've done more evil¦165679 \add things\add* than any of those¦165682 who \add ≈ruled before you\add*. You've \add ≈rejected me\add* and made cast images¦165692 of other¦165691 gods¦165690, and have provoked¦165693 me into anger.
\v 10 \add ≈Because of that\add*, I'm about¦165702 to bring¦165702 calamity¦165703 to \add *your\add* \add ≈family\add*: I'll \add ≈cause all your male descendants to die, either before or after they've left home\add*.

\p
\v 12 \add ≈So¦165741 go¦165743 back home\add*, \add but\add* \add ≈as soon as you¦165741 set foot in\add* the city¦165747, your son will die¦165748.
\v 13 All Yisrael will \add ≈mourn¦165751\add* for him and¦165757 they'll bury¦165757 him. \add ≈He'll be the only one of your children to be buried\add*, because¦165768 \add ≈out of all of Yarave'am's descendants, he's the only one that\add* Yisrael's¦165756 God¦165777 Yahweh¦165776 found¦165769 good¦165773 in.
\v 14 \add ≈In the future,\add* Yahweh¦165783 will \add ≈appoint\add* for himself, a king¦165785 over Yisrael¦165788 who will \add ≈get rid of Yarave'am's descendants\add*—\add in fact\add* \add ≈it's beginning to come about\add* even now.
\v 15 And Yahweh will strike¦165802 Yisrael just like the \add #reeds\add* \add ≈bend over in the swamps\add*, and he'll uproot¦165811 Yisrael from this good¦165817 soil that he gave¦165820 to their ancestors¦165821 and he'll scatter¦165822 them beyond¦165823 the Euphrates, because¦165825 they made their Asherah \add statues\add* which¦165819 provoked¦165831 Yahweh to anger¦165831.
\v 16 He will hand Yisrael over \add to their enemies\add* because of Yarave'am's sins¦165841 and \add how\add* he \add ≈encouraged\add* Yisrael to sin¦165846.”

\v 2 He sent¦169293 messengers¦169294 to Yisrael's¦169300 King Ahav \add who was inside\add* the city¦169301
\v 3 to tell him, “Ben¦169307-Hadad¦169309 says¦169306 that your gold¦169312 and silver¦169311 are mine, as well as the best of your wives¦169316 and sons.”

\v 3 \add ≈But¦170241\add* Navot \add ≈replied\add*, “Far be it for me \add ≈to disobey\add* Yahweh¦170248 by giving up the inheritance¦170252 \add ≈entrusted to\add* my ancestors¦170253.”
\p
\v 4 \add ≈So¦170256\add* Ahav went \add back\add* to his palace bitter and angry¦170262 \add ≈because of Navot's refusal to turn over the land\add*. He \add ≈refused to eat\add* and \add ≈went\add* to bed with his face towards the wall,

\p
\v 6 “\add ≈Well,\add* I talked with Navot the Yezreelite¦170317,” he \add ≈replied\add*. “\add ≈I offered to pay cash for his vineyard or to exchange it for another one if he preferred, but he wouldn't let me have it\add*.”

\v 8 \add ≈So¦170372\add* she wrote¦170372 letters¦170373 in Ahav's name¦170374 and sealed¦170376 them with his seal. Then¦170372 she sent¦170378 them to the city¦170389 elders¦170383 and nobles¦170387 who lived¦170390 near Navot.
\v 9 \add ≈This is what\add* she wrote¦170395, “Announce a fast, and¦170401 seat¦170401 Navot hear the head \add ≈of the table\add*.
\v 10 Then seat¦170408 two¦170409 \add ≈troublemakers opposite¦170414\add* him, and get them to testify¦170415 against him that he cursed God¦170418 and the king¦170419. Then take¦170420 him outside and \add ≈pelt him with rocks until he's dead\add*.
\p
\v 11 Then¦170424 the elders¦170427 and nobles¦170428 of the city did what Izevel¦170435 had instructed them via the letters¦170438:

\v 17 Then Yahweh¦170544 told Eliyyah (from Tishbe¦170548),

\v 21 \add Yahweh says that\add* \add ≈he's about¦170619 to send disaster on you to destroy\add* you and \add ≈every male in your household—whether they're slaves or free\add*.
