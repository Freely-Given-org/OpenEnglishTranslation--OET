\mt2 Yohan's
\mt1 Revelation
\mt2 of Yeshua the messiah
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk Yohan's (John's) revelation of Yeshua (Jesus) the messiah\bk* concerns events that will happen in the future. This was written long ago in a time when the believers were persecuted due to their faith in the master Yeshua, the messiah, and Yohan himself had been forcibly exiled to Patmos Island by the Roman authorities and held there. Yohan's main purpose for writing this was to give hope to the believers and to encourage them to persevere in their faith despite their persecution.
\ip A major portion of what's written in this document is the revelation by Yeshua the messiah to Yohan about incredible signs and all those symbols have a meaning and interpretation. At the time of writing, some were likely understood by the Christians of the time, but now, some of the symbols are very hard to interpret, and there's been a large range of interpretations from different people. But even though it's like that, there are also some signs that are easier to understand like ‘horns’ which denote power and authority, and ‘sword’ which denotes war. The themes are repeated throughout this document in various different forms. But it's important to just understand the main points of what's written here: God will indeed destroy all of his enemies through the messiah Yeshua, and also, he will reward all his people who persevere in serving him, and then he'll bring them to live with him. The final major them concerns the new sky and earth that God will create, and concerning the new Yerushalem that will descend from heaven.

\s1 Yohan sees the messiah
\rem /s1 Vision of the Son of Man; A Vision of Christ; One like a Son of Man
\p
\v 9 I, Yohan, am your¦155562 brother¦155561 and partner in the suffering \add that's typical of those who follow\add* Yeshua. \add I've been exiled to\add* Patmos¦155588 Island where I endure¦155574 because¦155589 I believe God's message¦155592 and \nd Yeshua's\nd* testimony¦155598 and \add look forward to\add* his kingdom¦155572.
\v 10 One Sunday \add while I was meditating\add*, \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦155604\nd* gave me a vision, and¦155609 I heard¦155610 a voice¦155614 behind¦155612 me that seemed as loud¦155615 as a trumpet¦155619 blast
\v 11 that said, “Write down what you¦155635 see \add here\add* on a scroll¦155640 and send¦155642 it to the seven¦155644 assemblies¦155645 \add of believers\add*—to \add the cities of\add* Ephesus¦155650, Smyrna¦155653, Pergamum¦155656, Thyatira¦155659, Sardis¦155666, Philadelphia¦155669, and to Laodicea¦155672.”
\p
\v 12 Then¦155673 I turned to see who was talking¦155680 to me, and¦155673 I saw¦155687 seven¦155688 golden¦155690 lamp holders,
\v 13 and standing among them was a man who looked like humanity's child,\f + \fr 1:13 \ft It's not certain what was meant here: either ‘a man who looked like humanity's child’ or ‘a form that looked like a human man’.\f* wearing a long robe with a golden¦155711 sash around His¦155702 chest.\x + \xo 1:13: a \xt Dan 7:13; \xo b \xt Dan 10:5.\x*
\v 14 His¦155716 hair¦155719 was gleaming white like wool or snow and¦155714 his¦155716 eyes¦155729 were \add bright\add* like a fiery flame¦155732.\x + \xo 1:14: \xt Dan 7:9.\x*
\v 15 His¦155737 feet¦155736 shone like bronze¦155739 that had been refined¦155743 in a furnace¦155742, and his¦155737 voice was like the sound of a \add river of rushing\add* water¦155752.\x + \xo 1:15: \xt Eze 1:24; 43:2.\x*
\v 16 He was holding¦155755 seven¦155764 stars¦155763 in his right¦155759 hand¦155761 and a sharp¦155772 sword¦155770 was extending from his mouth¦155768, and his face¦155776 was like the sun¦155781 shining¦155782 at its¦155786 brightest.
\v 17 And when I saw¦155789 him, I quickly lay at his feet¦155795, \add breathless\add* like a dead¦155799 man, but he placed his right¦155804 hand¦155804 on me, and told me, “Don't be afraid. \em I am\em* the first¦155817 and the last.\x + \xo 1:17: \xt Isa 44:6; 48:12; Rev 2:8; 22:13.\x*
\v 18 I lived and died \add here on the earth\add*, but look, \add now\add* I'm alive \add again\add* and will live for all eternity, and I control the keys over death¦155842 and over hell.

\v 2 “I know about your activities and work, and your endurance¦155947 and that you can't¦155951 tolerate evil¦155954 people, and that you've investigated the ones who call themselves¦155961 missionaries but are not, and you've found¦155969 them to be frauds.
\v 3 \add I'm aware that\add* you've endured¦155975 and even suffered \add persecution\add* because¦155982 you've \add believed in\add* me, but you've never given up.
\v 4 However, I do have something against¦155994 you: you've abandoned the love¦155998 that you first¦156001 had.
\v 5 So¦156019 \add now, you need to\add* remember¦156006 where¦156008 you've fallen¦156009 from, and repent and repeat how you behaved at the beginning, but if you don't, I'll come to you and if you don't repent, I'll remove¦156026 your¦156029 lampstand¦156028 from its¦156033 place¦156032.
\v 6 But you do have this going for you: you hate what the \add disciples of\add* Nicolaus are doing,\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Nicolaus' disciples ate food that had been sacrificed to idols and committed sexual sins.\f* just like I do.

\v 10 Don't be afraid about what you're¦156144 going to suffer¦156146.

\p The truth, the faithful¦157043 and¦157044 true witness¦157041, the originator of God's creation¦157052, says:
\v 15 “I'm aware of what you've been doing \add and\add* that you're¦157062 neither¦157060 hot nor cold. (You'd benefit\f + \fr 3:15 \ft TC: Some manuscripts don't have this parenthesised sentence at all, and some later manuscripts have ‘I wish’ instead of ‘You'd benefit’.\f* if you were hot or cold.)
\v 16 So because¦157073 you're¦157076 lukewarm¦157075, neither¦157078 hot nor cold¦157083, I'll spit you out of my¦157094 mouth¦157092.

\v 18 I advise you to buy gold¦157131 from me that's been refined¦157132 by fire¦157134 so that you might get rich, and buy white¦157139 clothes¦157138 so that you can dress yourself¦157141 so that the shame¦157146 of your nakedness¦157148 might not be displayed, and buy ointment to rub on your eyes¦157157 so that you'll be able to see.

\v 1 After¦157239 that, I looked¦157241 and wow¦157243, a door¦157244 opening in heaven¦157248, and the first¦157254 voice¦157252 that I'd heard¦157256 that sounded like a trumpet¦157258 told me, “Come up here and I'll show you what must happen after¦157274 those things.”
\v 2 Immediately¦157277 I was in the \nd spirit¦157280\nd* and wow¦157282, a throne was appearing in heaven¦157287 with someone sitting¦157295 on it.\x + \xo 4:2-3: \xt Eze 1:26-28; 10:1.\x*
\v 3 The one sitting¦157299 there \add sparkled like jewels\add*, and an emerald-looking rainbow¦157313 encircled the throne¦157316.
\v 4 Surrounding that throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on them sat twenty-four elders¦157342 dressed in white¦157347 and with golden¦157355 crowns¦157354 on their¦157353 heads¦157352.
\v 5 From the \add centre\add* throne came lightning¦157361 flashes and thunderous¦157366 sounds and voices¦157364. In front of it, seven torches were burning, which¦157378 are God's seven spirits¦157383.\x + \xo 4:5: a \xt Exo 19:16; Rev 8:5; 11:19; 16:18; \xo b \xt Eze 1:13; \xo c \xt Rev 1:4; Zech 4:2.\x*
\v 6 In front of the throne was something¦157386 like a sea¦157391 of glass¦157392 that was as clear as crystal¦157394.
\p Around the throne were four living¦157405 creatures¦157405, covered \add both\add* front and¦157395 back with eyes¦157407.\x + \xo 4:6: \xt Eze 1:22.\x*
\v 7 This first¦157415 living creature resembled a lion¦157417, the second¦157420 resembled a bull, the third¦157426 had a face¦157431 like a man, and¦157411 the fourth¦157439 one resembled a flying¦157443 eagle¦157442.
\v 8 Each of the four¦157446 living¦157447 creatures¦157447 had six¦157459 wings¦157458 with eyes¦157465 all around¦157460 and underneath them. Day and night¦157472 they never stop saying¦157473:\x + \xo 4:8: a \xt Eze 1:18; 10:12; \xo b \xt Isa 6:2-3.\x*

\v 10 the twenty-four elders¦157529 drop to their knees with their faces to the ground in front of the one sitting¦157532 on the throne and worship the one who lives through all the ages. They place their crowns¦157551 down in front of the throne and say:

\p
\v 1 Then¦157592 I saw¦157593 a scroll¦157603 in the right-hand of the one sitting¦157599 on the throne¦157602. It had writing on both sides, and¦157592 had been sealed¦157610 with seven¦157612 \add wax\add* seals¦157611.\x + \xo 5:1: \xt Eze 2:9-10; Isa 29:11.\x*

\v 3 But¦157634 there wasn't any person on earth or \add in the place of the dead\add* who was permitted to open the scroll¦157653 and¦157642 read it¦157657.
\v 4 I began to cry loudly, because¦157662 no one could be found¦157666 who was worthy¦157664 to open the scroll¦157671 or look inside it¦157674.
\v 5 Then¦157675 one of the elders¦157679 said to me, “Stop crying. Look¦157684, here's the lion¦157687 from the tribe¦157692 of Yudah¦157693.

\v 6 Then¦157711 I saw¦157712 a lamb standing there between the throne¦157717 and the four¦157720 living¦157721 creatures¦157721 and the elders¦157726. The lamb looked like it had been slaughtered, and it had seven horns¦157734 and seven eyes¦157737 which¦157739 are God's seven spirits¦157744 that¦157739 had been sent¦157751 throughout the world.\x + \xo 5:6: a \xt Isa 53:7; \xo b \xt Zech 4:10.\x*
\v 7 The lamb went¦157757 up to the throne and¦157756 accepted \add the scroll\add* from the right¦157764 hand¦157764 of the one sitting¦157767 on the throne.
\v 8 When he'd taken the scroll¦157775, the four living¦157778 creatures¦157778 and the twenty-four elders knelt down in front of the lamb. Each elder held a harp and a bowl that¦157798 was full of incense¦157797 (which¦157798 symbolised the prayers¦157802 of the believers).\x + \xo 5:8: \xt Psa 141:2.\x*
\v 9 They sung a new song \add like this\add*:\x + \xo 5:9: \xt Psa 33:3; 98:1; Isa 42:10.\x*
\q1 “It's you who's worthy to take the scroll¦157815 and break its¦157820 seals¦157819,
\q1 because¦157821 you were slaughtered and with your¦157831 blood¦157830 you purchased \add people\add* for \nd God¦157826\nd*

\p
\v 11 Then¦157860 I looked¦157861 and I heard¦157863 the voices¦157865 of the living¦157874 creatures¦157874 and elders¦157877 that were around¦157869 the throne¦157871 along with millions of \add God's\add* messengers¦157866\x + \xo 5:11: \xt Dan 7:10.\x*

\p
\v 14 Then¦157982 the four¦157984 living¦157985 creatures¦157985 said, “May¦157989 it¦157989 be¦157989 so¦157989,” and the elders¦157994 knelt down and worshipped.

\v 1 Then¦158004 I saw¦158005 the lamb breaking the first of the seven¦158014 seals¦158015, and¦158016 I heard¦158017 one of the four¦158021 living¦158022 creatures¦158022 say, “Come,” in a thunderous¦158029 voice¦158026.
\v 2 So¦158035 I looked¦158036, and wow¦158038, there was a white¦158040 horse¦158039 with someone sitting¦158043 on it holding a bow \add and arrow\add*. A crown¦158053 was given¦158051 to him, and then¦158035 he went¦158055 out as a conqueror to conquer.\x + \xo 6:2: \xt Zech 1:8; 6:3,6.\x*
\v 3 And when \add the lamb\add* broke the second seal, I heard¦158070 the second living¦158073 creature¦158073 say, “Come,”
\v 4 and another horse came out. It was a red horse, and the one sitting¦158091 on it was given permission to withdraw peace¦158099 from the earth¦158103 so that \add people\add* would slaughter each other, and a large sword¦158112 was given to him.\x + \xo 6:4: \xt Zech 1:8; 6:2.\x*
\v 5 Then¦158115 \add the lamb\add* broke the third seal and I heard¦158123 the third living¦158126 creature¦158126 say, “Come.” I looked¦158133, and wow¦158135, there was a black¦158137 horse¦158136, and the one sitting¦158141 on it¦158143 held balancing scales¦158146 in his¦158150 hand¦158149.\x + \xo 6:5: \xt Zech 6:2,6.\x*

But¦158151 don't¦158178 harm the oil and¦158151 wine \add supplies\add*.”
\p
\v 7 When \add the lamb\add* broke the fourth seal, I heard¦158187 the voice¦158188 of the fourth living¦158193 creature¦158193 saying¦158195, “Come.”
\v 8 Then¦158201 I looked¦158202, and wow¦158204, there was a green¦158206 horse¦158205. The one sitting on it was named ‘Death¦158216’, and Hades¦158219 was \add sitting\add* behind him.

\p
\v 9 When \add the lamb\add* broke the fifth¦158256 seal, under the altar¦158263 I saw¦158259 the souls¦158265 of everyone who had been killed because of God's word and¦158275 because of the testimony¦158278 that¦158268 they¦158286 had upheld.
\v 10 These souls called out loudly¦158292, “You, master¦158297, always do what is right and decide what is right! So¦158288 please condemn and punish the people on the earth¦158317 who killed us.”
\v 11 Then¦158318 each of them was given¦158319 a white¦158326 robe¦158324, and told to wait a little¦158338 longer until¦158339 the full number was reached of their¦158348 fellow¦158347 servants and brothers¦158351 and sisters¦158351 who would also be killed¦158356 like they were.

\p
\v 6 Then¦159124 the seven messengers¦159127 who had the seven trumpets¦159132, got ready to blow them.
\p
\v 7 Then¦159138 the first¦159140 messenger blew his trumpet¦159142 and then¦159138 hail and fire¦159147 mixed¦159148 together with blood¦159151 was thrown¦159153 \add down\add* on the earth and a third of the earth was burnt up along with a third of the trees¦159167, and all the green¦159172 grass¦159171 got burnt up.\x + \xo 8:7: \xt Exo 9:23-25; Eze 38:22.\x*
\p
\v 8 Then¦159174 the second¦159176 messenger¦159177 blew his trumpet¦159178, and something¦159179 was thrown¦159185 into the ocean that was like a huge¦159182, burning mountains¦159181, and a third¦159193 of the sea turned into blood¦159196.
\v 9 One third of the living creatures¦159204 in the sea¦159208 died¦159198, and a third of the ships¦159217 were destroyed.
\p
\v 10 Then¦159220 the third messenger¦159223 blew his trumpet¦159224 and a huge¦159231 star¦159230, burning like a torch¦159234, fell \add down\add* from the sky¦159229 and landed on a third of the rivers¦159241 and on the springs¦159245 of water¦159247.\x + \xo 8:10: \xt Isa 14:12.\x*
\v 11 That star¦159252 is named ‘Bitterness’ and¦159259 a third¦159263 of those waters turned bitter¦159279. Many people¦159272 died from the waters, because¦159278 they \add became¦159260 poisonous\add*.\x + \xo 8:11: \xt Jer 9:15.\x*
\p
\v 12 Then¦159280 the fourth¦159282 messenger¦159283 blew his trumpet¦159284 and a third of the sun and the moon were struck and the sun didn't¦159312 shine for a third of the day¦159308, nor the moon for a third of the night¦159323.

\v 13 Then¦159325 as I watched, I heard¦159328 an eagle¦159330 that¦159357 was flying¦159332 high in the sky, shouting loudly¦159337, “Three terrible things will happen to the people who are living¦159344 on the earth¦159347 when the three¦159355 remaining messengers¦159356 blow their trumpets¦159353.”
\c 9
\s1 The fifth trumpet brings the first terror
\p
\v 1 Then¦159360 the fifth¦159362 messenger blew his trumpet¦159364 and I saw¦159366 a star that had fallen¦159372 from the sky¦159371 to the earth¦159376, and he/it\f + \fr 9:1 \ft It's ambiguous in the Greek whether the key was given to the messenger or the star, or possibly the falling star was the messenger.\f* was given the key to the deep, dark pit.
\v 2 When he/it \add unlocked and\add* opened¦159387 that pit, smoke came up out of it like the smoke of a large furnace¦159402, and the smoke darkened¦159407 the sun¦159409 and the air.\x + \xo 9:2: \xt Gen 19:8.\x*
\v 3 Then¦159418 locusts¦159423 came out of the smoke¦159421 and \add descended\add* on the land, and they were given¦159428 \add stinging\add* power like the large scorpions¦159436 of the earth.\x + \xo 9:3: \xt Exo 10:12-15.\x*
\v 4 \add However the locusts\add* were told that they¦159445 shouldn't¦159464 harm the grass¦159448 or any green¦159454 plants or trees, but only those people¦159461 who didn't¦159464 have God's mark on their¦159471 foreheads¦159472.\x + \xo 9:4: \xt Eze 9:4.\x*
\v 5 They weren't given¦159475 power to kill¦159480 them, but only to torment them for five¦159487 months¦159486, and¦159474 their¦159491 torment was like that of a scorpion¦159494 when it strikes¦159497 a person¦159498.
\v 6 People in those¦159503 days¦159502 will try to die, but won't¦159514 be able to—they will long to die, but death will run away from them.\x + \xo 9:6: \xt Yob 3:21; Jer 8:3.\x*
\p
\v 7 The locusts¦159535 looked like horses¦159539 that had been prepared¦159540 for battle, with something¦159543 on their heads¦159546 that were similar to golden crowns¦159549 and¦159531 their faces being like human¦159559 faces.\x + \xo 9:7: \xt Yoel 2:4.\x*
\v 8 Their¦159569 hair was like women's¦159565 hair and their¦159569 teeth were like lions' teeth.\x + \xo 9:8: \xt Yoel 1:6.\x*
\v 9 They wore chestplates that seemed to be made of iron, and the sound of their¦159584 wings¦159583 was like the roar of many horses¦159588 rushing into battle pulling chariots¦159587.\x + \xo 9:9: \xt Yoel 2:5.\x*
\v 10 They had tails with stingers¦159600 like scorpions¦159598 which had the power¦159609 to harm people¦159616 for five¦159618 months¦159617.
\v 11 They had a king¦159627 in charge of them who's the messenger¦159631 of the deep pit—his name is ‘Destroyer’. (‘Abaddon¦159640’ in Hebrew and ‘Apollyon¦159651’ in Greek.)
\p
\v 12 The first terrible event has now passed, but there are still¦159660 two¦159662 more to follow.
\s1 The sixth trumpet brings the second terror
\p
\v 13 Then¦159667 the sixth¦159669 messenger¦159670 blew his trumpet¦159671 and¦159672 I heard¦159673 a voice¦159674 coming from the corners of the golden¦159683 altar¦159681 in front of \nd God¦159687\nd*,\x + \xo 9:13: \xt Exo 30:1-3.\x*
\v 14 that was telling the sixth¦159691 messenger (with the trumpet¦159698), “Release¦159699 the four¦159701 messengers that are tied up by the large Euphrates¦159714 River.”
\v 15 So¦159716 the four¦159720 messengers¦159721 who had been prepared¦159723 for this exact time were released to kill¦159737 a third¦159739 of humankind.
\v 16 I heard¦159757 someone say how many mounted soldiers there were—there were 200 million of them,
\v 17 and this is what the horses and their riders looked like in my vision¦159768: the soldiers \add wore\add* chestplates that were \add red like\add* fire, \add blue like\add* sapphire, and \add yellow like\add* sulfur. The heads of the horses were like lions' heads, and fire, smoke¦159799, and fumes of burning sulfur came out of their mouths¦159794.
\v 18 These three¦159805 plagues¦159806 (fire¦159817, smoke¦159821, and burning sulfur¦159825 coming out of their¦159831 mouths¦159830) killed¦159808 one third¦159811 of humankind
\v 19 because the horses' power¦159837 is in their mouths¦159847 and in their tails, because their tails are like snakes, having¦159864 heads¦159867 that injure¦159871 \add people\add*.
\p
\v 20 \add However,\add* the rest of humankind that hadn't been killed¦159879 by those plagues¦159882, didn't repent¦159888 of their¦159894 actions and didn't stop worshipping demons¦159900 and idols \add made\add* of gold and silver¦159908 and bronze¦159911 and stone¦159915 and wood—idols that can't see, can't hear¦159926, and can't walk¦159928.\x + \xo 9:20: \xt Psa 115:4-7; 135:15-17; Dan 5:23.\x*
\v 21 They \add also\add* didn't repent¦159931 of their murdering¦159935 or of their sorcery¦159940, nor of their sexual immorality or of their stealing.

\s1 The messenger and the small scroll
\rem /s1 The Angel with the Little Scroll; The Angel and the Small Scroll
\p
\v 1 Then¦159954 \add in the vision\add* I saw¦159955 another¦159956 powerful messenger¦159957 coming¦159959 down from heaven¦159962 wrapped in a cloud¦159964 and with a rainbow¦159968 above his head. His¦159974 face¦159978 was like the sun¦159982 and his feet¦159985 were like pillars¦159988 of fire¦159990,
\v 2 and he was holding a small¦159999 opened¦160000 scroll¦159999. He set his right¦160007 foot \add down\add* on the ocean and his left \add foot down\add* on the land
\v 3 and shouted in a loud¦160024 voice like a lion¦160026 roaring¦160027, and when he shouted, the seven¦160034 thunders¦160036 spoke¦160032 out in their own voices.
\v 4 When the seven thunders spoke, I was going¦160054 to write \add down what they said\add* but I heard¦160059 a voice¦160060 from heaven¦160064 that said, “Keep what the seven thunders have said secret, and¦160042 don't¦160076 write it down.”
\p
\v 5 Then¦160080 the messenger¦160082 that I'd seen straddling the ocean and¦160080 the land raised his¦160096 right¦160098 hand¦160095\x + \xo 10:5-7: \xt Exo 20:11; Deu 32:40; Dan 12:7; Amos 3:7.\x*
\v 6 and made an oath by the one living¦160106 through all the ages and who created¦160113 heaven¦160115 and everything in it and the earth¦160122 and everything in it, and the sea¦160129 and everything in it, saying, “There won't be any more delay,
\v 7 but¦160141 at the time when the seventh¦160148 messenger¦160149 will speak and blow his trumpet¦160155, then the hidden purposes of \nd God¦160162\nd* will come to be, just like he told his slaves¦160168 the prophets¦160174 \add long ago\add*.”
\p
\v 8 Then¦160176 the one whom I had heard¦160180 speak¦160185 from heaven¦160183 spoke to me again¦160184, saying¦160190, “Go and get the open scroll¦160195 from the hand¦160201 of the messenger¦160203 who is straddling the ocean and the land.”\x + \xo 10:8-10: \xt Exo 2:8–3:3.\x*
\v 9 So¦160213 I went¦160214 to the messenger¦160218 and asked him to give¦160221 me the little¦160226 scroll¦160226, and he answered, “Take it and eat it. At first it'll taste sweet¦160247 like honey¦160249, but afterwards it'll be uncomfortable in your¦160237 stomach¦160240.”
\v 10 So¦160250 I took¦160251 that little¦160254 scroll¦160254 from the messenger's¦160259 hand¦160257 and ate¦160275 it, and it tasted sweet¦160272 like honey¦160271, but my¦160268 stomach¦160280 hurt afterwards
\v 11 and they¦160283 told me, “You have to speak out God's message about many nations¦160294 and people¦160291 groups and language groups and kings¦160298.”

\p
\v 1 Then¦160302 I was given¦160303 a measuring stick and told, “Go and measure God's temple¦160319 and the altar¦160324 and the people who are worshipping there,\x + \xo 11:1: \xt Exo 40:3; Zech 2:1-2.\x*

\v 3 Then¦160368 I'll give my¦160373 two witnesses¦160372 \add the ability\add* to speak out God's message for six months, while dressed in mourning garb.

\v 6 Those witnesses have the power to stop the rain so that it doesn't rain while they're speaking out, and they have power to turn \add rivers and lakes\add* into blood¦160472, and to damage the earth¦160476 with every¦160478 type of plague¦160479 just as often¦160480 as they want.\x + \xo 11:6: a \xt 1Ki 17:1; \xo b \xt Exo 7:17-19; \xo c \xt 1Sam 4:8.\x*

\v 10 Those who are living¦160585 on the earth will be happy about it and celebrate and send gifts¦160597 to each another¦160601 because¦160603 those two¦160606 prophets¦160607 had tormented¦160611 them,
\v 11 but after¦160619 three¦160621 and a half days¦160622, God's breath of life¦160628 will enter into them and they'll stand up. The people who see that will be terrified.\x + \xo 11:11: \xt Eze 37:10.\x*

\v 3 One of the heads¦161528 of the sea creature looked as if someone had wounded it so that it had died, but that wound had healed¦161542 and as a result, all the people of the earth¦161551 marvelled¦161545 at the sea creature and \add obeyed\add* it.
\v 4 They worshipped the dinosaur¦161561 because¦161563 he had given authority¦161569 to the sea creature, and they worshipped the sea creature, saying¦161578, “Who is like this sea creature and who is able to battle against it?”
\p

\v 11 Then¦161742 I saw¦161743 a second wild animal¦161745 come up from the earth¦161750. It had two¦161754 small horns¦161753 on its head like a lamb, but it spoke like a dinosaur¦161763.
\v 12 This land animal carries out all the orders¦161785 of the sea creature and¦161779 insists that the people who live on the earth¦161778 worship the sea creature—the one that almost died except its¦161799 wound¦161796 healed¦161794.
\v 13 The land animal also did amazing miracles and¦161800 it even caused fire¦161806 to fall from the sky¦161815 down to the earth¦161822 that people¦161825 could see.
\v 14 The dinosaur gave¦161839 the land animal the power to do these miracles on behalf of the sea creature. The land animal used the miracles to deceive¦161827 the people who live on the earth, telling¦161845 them to make an idol that looked like the sea creature that had survived a sword¦161867 wound¦161861 that seemed to kill it.
\v 15 The dinosaur \add also\add* gave¦161872 the land animal the power to make that idol live and¦161889 so the idol that looked like the sea creature was able to speak¦161884. The land animal was able to execute anyone who refused to worship the idol
\v 16 and it¦161909 \add also\add* required each person, whether important or not, and whether rich or poor, free or slave¦161929, to have a mark on their right¦161942 hand¦161939 or on their forehead¦161948.

\v 18 This \add calls for\add* wisdom¦161986: Let anyone who has understanding calculate the number of the creature, because¦162001 it's the number of a man¦162002 and¦162004 his number is 666.\f + \fr 13:18 \ft There are some manuscripts that have the number as 616 (XIS) rather than 666 (XES).
