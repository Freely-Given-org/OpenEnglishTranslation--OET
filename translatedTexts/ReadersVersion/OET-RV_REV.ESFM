\mt2 Yohan's
\mt1 Revelation
\mt2 of Yeshua the messiah
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk Yohan's (John's) revelation of Yeshua (Jesus) the messiah\bk* concerns events that will happen in the future. This was written long ago in a time when the believers were persecuted due to their faith in the master Yeshua, the messiah, and Yohan himself had been forcibly exiled to Patmos Island by the Roman authorities and held there. Yohan's main purpose for writing this was to give hope to the believers and to encourage them to persevere in their faith despite their persecution.
\ip A major portion of what's written in this document is the revelation by Yeshua the messiah to Yohan of incredible signs and all those symbols have a meaning and interpretation. At the time of writing, some were likely understood by the Christians of the time, but now, some of the symbols are very hard to interpret, and there's been a large range of interpretations from different people. But even though it's like that, there are also some signs that are easier to understand like ‘horns’ which denote power and authority, and ‘sword’ which denotes war. The themes are repeated throughout this document in various different forms. But it's important to just understand the main points of what's written here: God will indeed destroy all of his enemies through the messiah Yeshua, and also, he will reward all his people who persevere in serving him, and then he'll bring them to live with him. The final major them concerns the new sky and earth that God will create, and concerning the new Yerushalem that will descend from heaven.

\s1 Yohan sees the messiah
\rem /s1 Vision of the Son of Man; A Vision of Christ; One like a Son of Man
\p
\v 9 I, Yohan, am your¦156574 brother¦156573 and partner in the suffering \add that's typical of those who follow\add* Yeshua. \add I've been exiled to\add* Patmos¦156601 Island where I endure¦156586 because¦156602 I believe God's message¦156605 and \nd Yeshua's\nd* testimony¦156611 and \add look forward to\add* his kingdom¦156584.
\v 10 One Sunday \add while I was meditating\add*, \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦156617\nd* gave me a vision, and¦156622 I heard¦156623 a voice¦156627 behind¦156625 me that seemed as loud¦156628 as a trumpet¦156632 blast
\v 11 that said, “Write down what you¦156649 see \add here\add* on a scroll¦156654 and send¦156656 it to the seven¦156658 assemblies¦156659 \add of believers\add*—to \add the cities of\add* Ephesus¦156664, Smyrna¦156667, Pergamum¦156671, Thyatira¦156674, Sardis¦156679, Philadelphia¦156682, and to Laodicea¦156685.”
\p
\v 12 Then¦156686 I turned to see who was talking¦156693 to me, and I saw¦156700 seven¦156701 golden¦156703 lamp holders,
\v 13 and standing among them was a man who looked like humanity's child,\f + \fr 1:13 \ft It's not certain what was meant here: either ‘a man who looked like humanity's child’ or ‘a form that looked like a human man’.\f* wearing a long robe with a golden¦156726 sash around His¦156715 chest.\x + \xo 1:13: a \xt Dan 7:13; \xo b \xt Dan 10:5.\x*
\v 14 His¦156732 hair¦156735 was gleaming white like wool or snow and his¦156732 eyes¦156745 were \add bright\add* like a fiery flame¦156748.\x + \xo 1:14: \xt Dan 7:9.\x*
\v 15 His¦156753 feet¦156752 shone like bronze¦156755 that had been refined¦156759 in a furnace¦156758, and his¦156753 voice was like the sound of a \add river of rushing\add* water¦156768.\x + \xo 1:15: \xt Eze 1:24; 43:2.\x*
\v 16 He was holding¦156771 seven¦156780 stars¦156779 in his right¦156775 hand¦156777 and a sharp¦156788 sword¦156786 was extending from his mouth¦156784, and his face¦156792 was like the sun¦156797 shining¦156798 at its¦156802 brightest.
\v 17 And when I saw¦156805 him, I quickly lay at his feet¦156811, \add breathless\add* like a dead¦156815 man, but he placed his right¦156820 hand¦156820 on me, and told me, “Don't be afraid. \em I am\em* the first¦156833 and the last.\x + \xo 1:17: \xt Isa 44:6; 48:12; Rev 2:8; 22:13.\x*
\v 18 I lived and died \add here on the earth\add*, but look, \add now\add* I'm alive \add again\add* and will live for all eternity, and I control the keys over death¦156858 and over hell.

\v 2 “I know about your activities and work, and your endurance¦156964 and that you can't¦156968 tolerate evil¦156971 people, and that you've investigated the ones who call themselves¦156978 missionaries but are not, and you've found¦156986 them to be frauds.
\v 3 \add I'm aware that\add* you've endured¦156992 and even suffered \add persecution\add* because¦156999 you've \add believed in\add* me, but you've never given up.
\v 4 However, I do have something against¦157011 you: you've abandoned the love¦157015 that you first¦157018 had.
\v 5 So¦157037 \add now, you need to\add* remember¦157023 where¦157025 you've fallen¦157026 from, and repent and repeat how you behaved at the beginning, but if you don't, I'll come to you and if you don't repent, I'll remove¦157044 your¦157047 lampstand¦157046 from its¦157051 place¦157050.
\v 6 But you do have this going for you: you hate what the \add disciples of\add* Nicolaus are doing,\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Nicolaus' disciples ate food that had been sacrificed to idols and committed sexual sins.\f* just like I do.

\p The one who's the first¦157118 and the last, who died but lived¦157126 \add again\add*, says these things:
\v 9 “I know about your suffering and your poverty¦157136, but you're¦157140 \add actually\add* rich! I also know how about the slander¦157143 of those who consider themselves¦157151 to be Jews, but they're not \add true\add* Jews because \add their\add* master is Satan¦157158.
\v 10 Don't be afraid about what you're¦157163 going to suffer¦157165.

\v 14 But I do have a few things against¦157286 you: you have some people there¦157292 who hold to \add the ancient prophet\add* Balaam's teaching.\x + \xo 2:14: a \xt Num 22:5,7; 31:16; Deu 23:4; \xo b \xt Num 25:1-3.\x* He taught¦157295 \add Moab's king\add*, Balak¦157303, how to tempt¦157307 the Israelis and to eat \add food\add* that had been sacrificed¦157314 to idols, and to be sexually¦157316 immoral¦157316.

\v 20 But I have against¦157451 you that you tolerate that woman Jezebel¦157462 who calls herself¦157468 a prophetess¦157471, and she deceives my servants by teaching¦157474 them to be sexually¦157482 immoral¦157482 and to eat \add food that's been\add* offered to idols.\x + \xo 2:20: \xt 1Ki 16:31; 2Ki 9:22,30.\x*

\v 14 To the assembly's¦158055 messenger¦158051 in Laodicea¦158054 write¦158057:\x + \xo 3:14: \xt Prv 8:22.\x*
\p The truth, the faithful¦158066 and¦158067 true witness¦158064, the originator of God's creation¦158075, says:
\v 15 “I'm aware of what you've been doing \add and\add* that you're¦158085 neither¦158083 hot nor cold. (You'd benefit\f + \fr 3:15 \ft TC: Some manuscripts don't have this parenthesised sentence at all, and some later manuscripts have ‘I wish’ instead of ‘You'd benefit’.\f* if you were hot or cold.)
\v 16 So because¦158096 you're¦158099 lukewarm¦158098, neither¦158101 hot nor cold¦158106, I'll spit you out of my¦158117 mouth¦158115.
\v 17 You brag, ‘I'm rich, \add yes\add* I've grown rich and don't have any needs,’ but you don't realise that you're¦158119 \add actually\add* miserable¦158137 and pitiable, and poor and blind¦158145 and naked¦158147.
\v 18 I advise you to buy gold¦158154 from me that's been refined¦158155 by fire¦158157 so that you might get rich, and buy white¦158162 clothes¦158161 so that you can dress yourself¦158164 so that the shame¦158169 of your nakedness¦158171 might not be displayed, and buy ointment to rub on your eyes¦158181 so that you'll be able to see.
\v 19 I tell off and discipline¦158192 those that I love, so be earnest and turn away from your disobedience.\x + \xo 3:19: \xt Prv 3:12; Heb 12:6.\x*
\v 20 Yes, I stand at the door and knock¦158204—if anyone¦158206 hears my¦158210 voice¦158209 and opens the door, I will come in and eat with him, and he'll eat with me.
\v 21 Anyone who overcomes¦158229, I'll give the right to sit with me on my throne, just like when I conquered and sat with my father¦158247 on his¦158252 throne.
\p
\v 22 Everyone who wants¦158254 to understand¦158254 needs¦158256 to listen¦158256 to what \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦158259\nd* is saying¦158260 to the assemblies¦158262.

\s1 Worshipping in heaven
\rem /s1 Visions of heaven; Worship in Heaven; The Heavenly Worship; The Throne in Heaven
\p
\v 1 After¦158263 that, I looked¦158265 and wow¦158267, a door¦158268 opening in heaven¦158273, and the first¦158279 voice¦158277 that I'd heard¦158281 that sounded like a trumpet¦158283 told me, “Come up here and I'll show you what must happen after¦158300 those things.”
\v 2 Immediately¦158303 I was in the \nd spirit¦158306\nd* and wow¦158308, a throne was appearing in heaven¦158313 with someone sitting¦158321 on it.\x + \xo 4:2-3: \xt Eze 1:26-28; 10:1.\x*
\v 3 The one sitting¦158325 there \add sparkled like jewels\add*, and an emerald-looking rainbow¦158339 encircled the throne¦158342.
\v 4 Surrounding that throne were twenty-four other thrones, and on them sat twenty-four elders¦158368 dressed in white¦158373 and with golden¦158381 crowns¦158380 on their¦158379 heads¦158378.
\v 5 From the \add centre\add* throne came lightning¦158388 flashes and thunderous¦158393 sounds and voices¦158391. In front of it, seven torches were burning, which¦158405 are God's seven spirits¦158410.\x + \xo 4:5: a \xt Exo 19:16; Rev 8:5; 11:19; 16:18; \xo b \xt Eze 1:13; \xo c \xt Rev 1:4; Zech 4:2.\x*
\v 6 In front of the throne was something¦158413 like a sea¦158418 of glass¦158419 that was as clear as crystal¦158421.
\p Around the throne were four living¦158432 creatures¦158432, covered \add both\add* front and back with eyes¦158434.\x + \xo 4:6: \xt Eze 1:22.\x*
\v 7 This first¦158442 living creature resembled a lion¦158444, the second¦158447 resembled a bull, the third¦158453 had a face¦158458 like a man, and the fourth¦158466 one resembled a flying¦158470 eagle¦158469.
\v 8 Each of the four¦158473 living¦158474 creatures¦158474 had six¦158486 wings¦158485 with eyes¦158492 all around¦158487 and underneath them. Day and night¦158499 they never stop saying¦158500:\x + \xo 4:8: a \xt Eze 1:18; 10:12; \xo b \xt Isa 6:2-3.\x*
\q1 ‘Holy, holy, holy,
\q2 is the \nd master¦158510\nd*, almighty¦158514 \nd God¦158512\nd*,
\q1 who was and is and is to come.’
\p
\v 9 Whenever the living creatures¦158529 praise the one sitting¦158537 on the throne¦158542 and honour¦158532 him and thank¦158534 him (the one who lives through all the ages),
\v 10 the twenty-four elders¦158557 drop to their knees with their faces to the ground in front of the one sitting¦158560 on the throne and worship the one who lives through all the ages. They place their crowns¦158579 down in front of the throne and say:
\q1
\v 11 “You, our¦158593 \nd God¦158592\nd* and \nd master¦158589\nd*, are worthy to receive¦158596 praise and honour¦158601 and power¦158604,
\q2 because¦158605 you created everything.
\q1 Everything exists just as you determined to create it.”

\s1 The scroll and the lamb
\rem /s1 The Lamb Opens the Scroll; The Scroll and the Lamb
\p
\v 1 Then¦158620 I saw¦158621 a scroll¦158631 in the right-hand of the one sitting¦158627 on the throne¦158630. It had writing on both sides, and had been sealed¦158638 with seven¦158640 \add wax\add* seals¦158639.\x + \xo 5:1: \xt Eze 2:9-10; Isa 29:11.\x*
\v 2 I also saw¦158642 a powerful messenger¦158643 who was asking in a loud¦158649 voice¦158648, “Who's worthy¦158652 to break¦158658 the seals¦158660 and¦158657 open the scroll¦158656?”
\v 3 But¦158662 there wasn't any person on earth or \add in the place of the dead\add* who was permitted to open the scroll¦158682 and¦158671 read it¦158686.
\v 4 I began to cry loudly, because¦158692 no one could be found¦158696 who was worthy¦158694 to open the scroll¦158701 or look inside it¦158704.
\v 5 Then¦158705 one of the elders¦158709 said to me, “Stop crying. Look¦158714, here's the lion¦158717 from the tribe¦158722 of Yudah¦158723. He's the descendant of \add King\add* David¦158726 who's a conqueror \add who's competent\add* to break the seals¦158736 and¦158732 open the scroll¦158731.”\x + \xo 5:5: a \xt Gen 49:9; \xo b \xt Isa 11:1,10.\x*
\p
\v 6 Then¦158741 I saw¦158742 a lamb standing there between the throne¦158747 and the four¦158750 living¦158751 creatures¦158751 and the elders¦158756. The lamb looked like it had been slaughtered, and it had seven horns¦158763 and seven eyes¦158766 which¦158768 are God's seven spirits¦158773 that had been sent¦158780 throughout the world.\x + \xo 5:6: a \xt Isa 53:7; \xo b \xt Zech 4:10.\x*
\v 7 The lamb went¦158786 up to the throne and accepted \add the scroll\add* from the right¦158793 hand¦158793 of the one sitting¦158796 on the throne.
\v 8 When he'd taken the scroll¦158804, the four living¦158807 creatures¦158807 and the twenty-four elders knelt down in front of the lamb. Each elder held a harp and a bowl that was full of incense¦158828 (which¦158829 symbolised the prayers¦158833 of the believers).\x + \xo 5:8: \xt Psa 141:2.\x*
\v 9 They sung a new song \add like this\add*:\x + \xo 5:9: \xt Psa 33:3; 98:1; Isa 42:10.\x*
\q1 “It's you who's worthy to take the scroll¦158846 and break its¦158851 seals¦158850,
\q1 because¦158852 you were slaughtered and with your¦158862 blood¦158861 you purchased \add people\add* for \nd God¦158857\nd*
\q2 from every¦158864 tribe¦158865 and language and people group and nation¦158871.
\q1
\v 10 You've made them to be a kingdom¦158879\x + \xo 5:10: \xt Exo 19:6; Rev 1:6.\x*
\q2 and to be priests¦158883 to \add serve\add* our¦158878 \nd God¦158877\nd*,
\q2 and they¦158886 will reign¦158886 on the earth¦158890.”
\p
\v 11 Then¦158891 I looked¦158892 and I heard¦158894 the voices¦158896 of the living¦158905 creatures¦158905 and elders¦158908 that were around¦158900 the throne¦158902 along with millions of \add God's\add* messengers¦158897\x + \xo 5:11: \xt Dan 7:10.\x*
\v 12 saying¦158919 with loud¦158921 voices¦158920:
\q1 “The lamb that was slaughtered is worthy to receive¦158929 power¦158931 and riches¦158934,
\q1 and wisdom¦158936 and strength¦158938 and honour¦158940 and praise and blessing¦158944.”
\p
\v 13 Then¦158945 I heard¦158982 every creature¦158947 in heaven¦158953 and on earth, and under the earth and in the sea¦158971—everything everywhere—saying¦158983,
\q1 “To the one sitting¦158986 on the throne¦158990
\q2 and to the lamb,
\q1 be praise and honour¦158999 and GLORY and power
\q2 forever and ever.”
\p
\v 14 Then¦159013 the four¦159015 living¦159016 creatures¦159016 said, “May¦159020 it¦159020 be¦159020 so¦159020,” and the elders¦159025 knelt down and worshipped.

\s1 The lamb breaks the first six seals
\rem /s1 The Seven Seals
\p
\v 1 Then¦159036 I saw¦159037 the lamb breaking the first of the seven¦159046 seals¦159047, and¦159048 I heard¦159049 one of the four¦159053 living¦159054 creatures¦159054 say, “Come,” in a thunderous¦159061 voice¦159058.
\v 2 So¦159067 I looked¦159068, and wow¦159070, there was a white¦159072 horse¦159071 with someone sitting¦159075 on it holding a bow \add and arrow\add*. A crown¦159085 was given¦159083 to him, and then he went¦159087 out as a conqueror to conquer.\x + \xo 6:2: \xt Zech 1:8; 6:3,6.\x*
\v 3 And when \add the lamb\add* broke the second seal, I heard¦159102 the second living¦159105 creature¦159105 say, “Come,”
\v 4 and another horse came out. It was a red horse, and the one sitting¦159123 on it was given permission to withdraw peace¦159131 from the earth¦159135 so that \add people\add* would slaughter each other, and a large sword¦159144 was given to him.\x + \xo 6:4: \xt Zech 1:8; 6:2.\x*
\v 5 Then¦159147 \add the lamb\add* broke the third seal and I heard¦159155 the third living¦159158 creature¦159158 say, “Come.” I looked¦159165, and wow¦159167, there was a black¦159169 horse¦159168, and the one sitting¦159173 on it¦159175 held balancing scales¦159178 in his¦159182 hand¦159181.\x + \xo 6:5: \xt Zech 6:2,6.\x*
\v 6 Then¦159183 I heard¦159184 \add something¦159184\add* like a voice¦159186 from among the four¦159190 living¦159191 creatures¦159191 that said, “A kilo of wheat¦159194 for a day's pay, or three¦159197 kilos of barley¦159200 for the same price. But¦159183 don't¦159210 harm the oil and wine \add supplies\add*.”
\p
\v 7 When \add the lamb\add* broke the fourth seal, I heard¦159220 the voice¦159221 of the fourth living¦159226 creature¦159226 saying¦159228, “Come.”
\v 8 Then¦159234 I looked¦159235, and wow¦159237, there was a green¦159239 horse¦159238. The one sitting on it was named ‘Death¦159249’, and Hades¦159252 was \add sitting\add* behind him. They were given¦159259 authority¦159262 over a quarter of the earth: to execute people with the sword¦159271, with famine¦159274, with death¦159277, and with the wild animals on the earth.\x + \xo 6:8: \xt Eze 14:21.\x*
\p
\v 9 When \add the lamb\add* broke the fifth¦159290 seal, under the altar¦159298 I saw¦159294 the souls¦159300 of everyone who had been killed because of God's word and¦159310 because of the testimony¦159313 that they¦159321 had upheld.
\v 10 These souls called out loudly¦159327, “You, master¦159332, always do what is right and decide what is right! So¦159323 please condemn and punish the people on the earth¦159352 who killed us.”
\v 11 Then¦159353 each of them was given¦159354 a white¦159361 robe¦159359, and told to wait a little¦159373 longer until¦159374 the full number was reached of their¦159383 fellow¦159382 servants and brothers¦159386 and sisters¦159386 who would also be killed¦159391 like they were.
\p
\v 12 When \add the lamb\add* broke the sixth¦159406 seal, there¦159411 was a violent earthquake¦159409 and the sun¦159415 went black like black cloth, and the moon¦159424 which was full, went \add red\add* like blood¦159428.\x + \xo 6:12: a \xt Rev 11:13; 16:18; \xo b \xt Isa 13:10; Yoel 2:10,31; 3:15; Mat 24:29; Mrk 13:24-25; Luk 21:25.\x*
\v 13 \add Also\add* the stars¦159431 fell out of the sky¦159434, just like how a fig¦159442 tree¦159442 out of season drops its¦159448 fruit when it¦159448 gets shaken¦159456 by a strong wind¦159452.\x + \xo 6:13-14: \xt Isa 34:4.\x*
\v 14 The sky was split apart like a scroll¦159462 being¦159463 rolled¦159463 up, and all the mountains¦159468 and islands¦159471 were moved¦159477 out of their¦159475 places¦159474.\x + \xo 6:14: \xt Rev 16:20.\x*
\v 15 Then¦159479 the kings¦159481 on the earth¦159483, and high-ranking officials, military officers, rich \add people\add* and \add influential individuals\add*, all slaves¦159501 and free \add people\add* hid in caves¦159509 and among¦159511 rocks¦159513 on the mountains¦159515.\x + \xo 6:15: \xt Isa 2:19,21.\x*
\v 16 They told the mountains¦159519 and rocks¦159522, “Fall \add down\add* on us and hide us so that the one sitting¦159533 on the throne¦159537 can't see us, and \add also\add* from the lamb's anger¦159543\x + \xo 6:16: \xt Hos 10:8; Luk 23:30.\x*
\v 17 because¦159546 today is the terrible day¦159549 when their¦159555 anger¦159553 has eventuated, and¦159556 who can stand up to that?”\x + \xo 6:17: \xt Yoel 2:11; Mal 3:2.\x*

\p
\v 1 After¦159561 that I saw¦159564 four messengers¦159566 standing around the earth, holding \add back\add* the four winds¦159577 of the earth so that no wind¦159585 would blow on land or sea¦159592 or on any tree¦159598.\x + \xo 7:1: \xt Jer 49:36; Dan 7:2; Zech 6:5.\x*

He called out loudly¦159619 to the four¦159621 messengers that God had permitted to damage the earth¦159629 and the sea¦159632,
\v 3 saying¦159633, “Don't harm the earth¦159639 or the sea¦159644 or the trees¦159648 until¦159649 we¦159652 can \add mark the\add* seal on the foreheads¦159660 of God's servants.”\x + \xo 7:3: \xt Eze 9:4,6.\x*

\v 5 There were 12,000 from the tribes of Yehudah, Reuben¦159690, Gad¦159696,

\p
\v 9 After¦159758 that, I looked¦159760 and wow¦159762, there was a huge¦159765 crowd¦159763 too large to count, from every¦159776 nation¦159777 and tribe¦159779 and people¦159781 and language, standing in front of the throne¦159790 and the lamb, having been dressed in white¦159798 robes¦159797 and holding palm branches¦159800,
\v 10 and they¦159807 were shouting loudly¦159810, “Our¦159818 \nd God¦159816\nd* who's sitting¦159820 on the throne¦159824 has saved us! The lamb has saved us!”
\v 11 Then¦159838 all the messengers stood¦159842 around the throne, and around the elders¦159849 and the four living¦159853 beings. The messengers all knelt down in front of the throne with their¦159864 faces¦159862 to the ground and worshipped \nd God¦159868\nd*
\v 12 saying¦159869, “Yes, may it be so. May praise and GLORY and wisdom¦159878 and thanks¦159881 and honour¦159884 and power¦159887 and strength¦159890 be \add given\add* to our¦159893 \nd God¦159892\nd* who lives through all the ages! May it be so.”
\p
\v 13 Then¦159900 one of the elders¦159905 asked me, “Who are those people in white¦159915 robes¦159913 and where¦159919 have they come from?”
\p
\v 14 “Sir, you are the one who knows,” I answered.\x + \xo 7:14: \xt Dan 12:1; Mat 24:21; Mrk 13:19.\x*
\p And then he told me, “Those are the ones who've come through the terrible tribulation¦159940, and they've washed¦159944 their¦159947 robes¦159946 in the blood¦159955 of the lamb and made them white¦159949.
\v 15 That's why they're here in front of God's throne, and they worship him day¦159969 and night¦159971 in his temple¦159974, and the one sitting¦159978 on the throne will extend his protection over them.

\v 1 Then¦160038 the lamb broke the seventh¦160045 seal and there was silence¦160047 in heaven¦160050 for about¦160051 half an hour¦160053.

\v 2 And I saw¦160055 the seven messengers¦160058 who stand in front of \nd God¦160062\nd* and they were each given¦160065 a trumpet¦160069.
\p
\v 3 Then¦160070 another¦160071 messenger¦160072 came¦160073 and stood¦160075 at the altar holding a golden bowl for burning incense.

\p
\v 6 Then¦160162 the seven messengers¦160165 who had the seven trumpets¦160170, got ready to blow them.
\p
\v 7 Then¦160176 the first¦160178 messenger blew his trumpet¦160180 and then hail and fire¦160185 mixed¦160186 together with blood¦160189 was thrown¦160191 \add down\add* on the earth and a third of the earth was burnt up along with a third of the trees¦160205, and all the green¦160210 grass¦160209 got burnt up.\x + \xo 8:7: \xt Exo 9:23-25; Eze 38:22.\x*
\p
\v 8 Then¦160212 the second¦160214 messenger¦160215 blew his trumpet¦160216, and something¦160217 was thrown¦160223 into the ocean that was like a huge¦160220, burning mountains¦160219, and a third¦160231 of the sea turned into blood¦160234.
\v 9 One third of the living creatures¦160242 in the sea¦160246 died¦160236, and a third of the ships¦160255 were destroyed.
\p
\v 10 Then¦160258 the third messenger¦160261 blew his trumpet¦160262 and a huge¦160269 star¦160268, burning like a torch¦160272, fell \add down\add* from the sky¦160267 and landed on a third of the rivers¦160279 and on the springs¦160283 of water¦160285.\x + \xo 8:10: \xt Isa 14:12.\x*
\v 11 That star¦160290 is named ‘Bitterness’ and a third¦160301 of those waters turned bitter¦160317. Many people¦160310 died from the waters, because¦160316 they \add became¦160298 poisonous\add*.\x + \xo 8:11: \xt Jer 9:15.\x*
\p
\v 12 Then¦160318 the fourth¦160320 messenger¦160321 blew his trumpet¦160322 and a third of the sun and the moon were struck and the sun didn't¦160350 shine for a third of the day¦160346, nor the moon for a third of the night¦160361.

\p
\v 13 Then¦160363 as I watched, I heard¦160366 an eagle¦160368 that was flying¦160370 high in the sky, shouting loudly¦160375, “Three terrible things will happen to the people who're living¦160382 on the earth¦160385 when the three¦160393 remaining messengers¦160394 blow their trumpets¦160391.”
\c 9
\s1 The fifth trumpet brings the first terror
\p
\v 1 Then¦160398 the fifth¦160400 messenger blew his trumpet¦160402 and I saw¦160404 a star that had fallen¦160410 from the sky¦160409 to the earth¦160414, and he/it\f + \fr 9:1 \ft It's ambiguous in the Greek whether the key was given to the messenger or the star, or possibly the falling star was the messenger.\f* was given the key to the deep, dark pit.
\v 2 When he/it \add unlocked and\add* opened¦160425 that pit, smoke came up out of it like the smoke of a large furnace¦160440, and the smoke darkened¦160445 the sun¦160447 and the air.\x + \xo 9:2: \xt Gen 19:8.\x*
\v 3 Then¦160456 locusts¦160461 came out of the smoke¦160459 and \add descended\add* on the land, and they were given¦160466 \add stinging\add* power like the large scorpions¦160474 of the earth.\x + \xo 9:3: \xt Exo 10:12-15.\x*
\v 4 \add However the locusts\add* were told that they¦160483 shouldn't¦160502 harm the grass¦160486 or any green¦160492 plants or trees, but only those people¦160499 who didn't¦160502 have God's mark on their¦160510 foreheads¦160511.\x + \xo 9:4: \xt Eze 9:4.\x*
\v 5 They weren't given¦160514 power to kill¦160519 them, but only to torment them for five¦160526 months¦160525, and their¦160530 torment was like that of a scorpion¦160533 when it strikes¦160536 a person¦160537.
\v 6 People in those¦160542 days¦160541 will try to die, but won't¦160553 be able to—they will long to die, but death will run away from them.\x + \xo 9:6: \xt Yob 3:21; Jer 8:3.\x*
\p
\v 7 The locusts¦160574 looked like horses¦160578 that had been prepared¦160579 for battle, with something¦160582 on their heads¦160585 that were similar to golden crowns¦160588 and their faces being like human¦160598 faces.\x + \xo 9:7: \xt Yoel 2:4.\x*
\v 8 Their¦160609 hair was like women's¦160605 hair and their¦160609 teeth were like lions' teeth.\x + \xo 9:8: \xt Yoel 1:6.\x*
\v 9 They wore chestplates that seemed to be made of iron, and the sound of their¦160625 wings¦160624 was like the roar of many horses¦160629 rushing into battle pulling chariots¦160628.\x + \xo 9:9: \xt Yoel 2:5.\x*
\v 10 They had tails with stingers¦160641 like scorpions¦160639 which had the power¦160650 to harm people¦160657 for five¦160659 months¦160658.
\v 11 They had a king¦160668 in charge of them who's the messenger¦160671 of the deep pit—his name is ‘Destroyer’. (‘Abaddon¦160680’ in Hebrew and ‘Apollyon¦160691’ in Greek.)
\p
\v 12 The first terrible event has now passed, but there are still¦160700 two¦160702 more to follow.
\s1 The sixth trumpet brings the second terror
\p
\v 13 Then¦160707 the sixth¦160709 messenger¦160710 blew his trumpet¦160711 and¦160712 I heard¦160713 a voice¦160714 coming from the corners of the golden¦160723 altar¦160721 in front of \nd God¦160727\nd*,\x + \xo 9:13: \xt Exo 30:1-3.\x*
\v 14 that was telling the sixth¦160731 messenger (with the trumpet¦160738), “Release¦160740 the four¦160742 messengers that are tied up by the large Euphrates¦160755 River.”
\v 15 So¦160757 the four¦160761 messengers¦160762 who had been prepared¦160764 for this exact time were released to kill¦160778 a third¦160780 of humankind.
\v 16 I heard¦160798 someone say how many mounted soldiers there were—there were 200 million of them,
\v 17 and this is what the horses and their riders looked like in my vision¦160809: the soldiers \add wore\add* chestplates that were \add red like\add* fire, \add blue like\add* sapphire, and \add yellow like\add* sulfur. The heads of the horses were like lions' heads, and fire, smoke¦160840, and fumes of burning sulfur came out of their mouths¦160835.
\v 18 These three¦160846 plagues¦160847 (fire¦160858, smoke¦160862, and burning sulfur¦160866 coming out of their¦160872 mouths¦160871) killed¦160849 one third¦160852 of humankind
\v 19 because the horses' power¦160878 is in their mouths¦160888 and in their tails, because their tails are like snakes, having¦160905 heads¦160908 that injure¦160912 \add people\add*.
\p
\v 20 \add However,\add* the rest of humankind that hadn't been killed¦160920 by those plagues¦160923, didn't repent¦160929 of their¦160935 actions and didn't stop worshipping demons¦160941 and idols \add made\add* of gold and silver¦160950 and bronze¦160954 and stone¦160959 and wood—idols that can't see, can't hear¦160970, and can't walk¦160972.\x + \xo 9:20: \xt Psa 115:4-7; 135:15-17; Dan 5:23.\x*
\v 21 They \add also\add* didn't repent¦160975 of their murdering¦160979 or of their sorcery¦160984, nor of their sexual immorality or of their stealing.
\c 10
\s1 The messenger and the small scroll
\rem /s1 The Angel with the Little Scroll; The Angel and the Small Scroll
\p
\v 1 Then¦160998 \add in the vision\add* I saw¦160999 another¦161000 powerful messenger¦161001 coming¦161003 down from heaven¦161006 wrapped in a cloud¦161008 and with a rainbow¦161012 above his head. His¦161018 face¦161022 was like the sun¦161026 and his feet¦161029 were like pillars¦161032 of fire¦161034,
\v 2 and he was holding a small¦161043 opened¦161045 scroll¦161043. He set his right¦161053 foot \add down\add* on the ocean and his left \add foot down\add* on the land
\v 3 and shouted in a loud¦161070 voice like a lion¦161072 roaring¦161073, and when he shouted, the seven¦161080 thunders¦161082 spoke¦161078 out in their own voices.
\v 4 When the seven thunders spoke, I was going¦161100 to write \add down what they said\add* but I heard¦161105 a voice¦161106 from heaven¦161110 that said, “Keep what the seven thunders have said secret, and don't¦161122 write it down.”
\p
\v 5 Then¦161126 the messenger¦161128 that I'd seen straddling the ocean and the land raised his¦161143 right¦161145 hand¦161141\x + \xo 10:5-7: \xt Exo 20:11; Deu 32:40; Dan 12:7; Amos 3:7.\x*
\v 6 and made an oath by the one living¦161153 through all the ages and who created¦161160 heaven¦161162 and everything in it and the earth¦161169 and everything in it, and the sea¦161176 and everything in it, saying, “There won't be any more delay,
\v 7 but¦161188 at the time when the seventh¦161195 messenger¦161196 will speak and blow his trumpet¦161202, then the hidden purposes of \nd God¦161209\nd* will come to be, just like he told his slaves¦161215 the prophets¦161221 \add long ago\add*.”
\p
\v 8 Then¦161223 the one whom I had heard¦161227 speak¦161232 from heaven¦161230 spoke to me again¦161231, saying¦161237, “Go and get the open scroll¦161242 from the hand¦161250 of the messenger¦161252 who is straddling the ocean and the land.”\x + \xo 10:8-10: \xt Exo 2:8–3:3.\x*
\v 9 So¦161262 I went¦161263 to the messenger¦161267 and asked him to give¦161270 me the little¦161275 scroll¦161275, and he answered, “Take it and eat it. At first it'll taste sweet¦161298 like honey¦161300, but afterwards it'll be uncomfortable in your¦161288 stomach¦161291.”
\v 10 So¦161301 I took¦161302 that little¦161305 scroll¦161305 from the messenger's¦161311 hand¦161309 and ate¦161327 it, and it tasted sweet¦161324 like honey¦161323, but my¦161320 stomach¦161332 hurt afterwards
\v 11 and they¦161335 told me, “You have to speak out God's message about many nations¦161346 and people¦161343 groups and language groups and kings¦161350.”

\p
\v 1 Then¦161354 I was given¦161355 a measuring¦161369 stick and told, “Go and measure God's temple¦161371 and the altar¦161376 and the people who're worshipping there,\x + \xo 11:1: \xt Exo 40:3; Zech 2:1-2.\x*
\v 2 but exclude the outer courtyard¦161385. Don't measure¦161402 that because¦161403 it's been given¦161404 to the non-Jews, and they'll tread¦161413 \add around\add* the holy city¦161410 for three and a half years.\x + \xo 11:2: \xt Luk 21:24.\x*
\v 3 Then¦161420 I'll give my¦161425 two witnesses¦161424 \add the ability\add* to speak out God's message for six months, while dressed in mourning garb.

\v 6 Those witnesses have the power to stop the rain so that it doesn't rain while they're speaking out, and they have power to turn \add rivers and lakes\add* into blood¦161524, and to damage the earth¦161528 with every¦161530 type of plague¦161532 just as often¦161533 as they want.\x + \xo 11:6: a \xt 1Ki 17:1; \xo b \xt Exo 7:17-19; \xo c \xt 1Sam 4:8.\x*

\v 8 Their¦161578 corpses¦161576 will \add lie\add* on the road¦161581 of the great¦161585 city¦161583, which¦161586 in spiritual¦161588 terms is called¦161587 Sodom¦161589 and¦161590/or Egypt¦161591 \add (Mitsrayim)\add*—where¦161592 their¦161578 \nd master¦161595\nd* was executed¦161598 \add by being¦161587 nailed to\add*\x + \xo 11:8: \xt Jhn 20:25.\x* a stake¦161598.\x + \xo 11:8: \xt Isa 1:9-10.\x*
\v 9 People from every nation¦161612 and tribe¦161608 and language will look at their corpses for three¦161620 and a half days¦161619 and will prevent their corpses from being put into a tomb¦161634.
\v 10 Those who're living¦161638 on the earth will be happy about it and celebrate and send gifts¦161650 to each another¦161654 because¦161656 those two¦161659 prophets¦161660 had tormented¦161664 them,
\v 11 but after¦161672 three¦161674 and a half days¦161675, God's breath of life¦161681 will enter into them and they'll stand up. The people who see that will be terrified.\x + \xo 11:11: \xt Eze 37:10.\x*

\p
\v 15 Then¦161795 the seventh¦161798 messenger¦161799 blew his trumpet¦161800, and voices¦161804 in heaven¦161808 shouted loudly, “The kingdom of the world¦161818 has become the kingdom of our¦161821 \nd master¦161820\nd* and of his \nd messiah¦161824\nd*, and he will reign¦161827 through all the ages.”\x + \xo 11:15: \xt Exo 15:18; Dan 2:44; 7:14,27.\x*

\v 13 When the dinosaur¦162360 realised that God had thrown¦162362 him \add down\add* to the earth¦162365, he tried to attack the woman¦162371 who had given birth to the son.
\v 14 But¦162379 two¦162385 large, eagle¦162390 wings¦162387 were given¦162380 to the woman¦162383 so that she could fly \add away\add* to the wilderness¦162397, to her¦162401 place¦162400 where¦162403 she'll be nourished¦162404 away from the snake for three and a half \add years\add*.\x + \xo 12:14: \xt Dan 7:25; 12:7.\x*
\v 15 Then¦162418 the snake poured water¦162434 out of his¦162430 mouth¦162429 like a river¦162436 towards the woman¦162433 so that the current would sweep her¦162439 away,
\v 16 but the ground helped the woman by opening up a big hole, and so the flood that the dinosaur¦162468 poured out from his¦162473 mouth disappeared into it.
\v 17 The dinosaur¦162477 was furious with the woman and went¦162482 away to battle against the rest of her¦162492 children¦162491, the ones obeying God's commands¦162496 and \add believing\add* \nd Yeshua's\nd* testimony¦162502.

\p
\v 1 and I saw¦162516 a wild creature coming up out of the water. It had ten horns and seven¦162530 heads, and on its horns were ten crowns¦162538, and anti-God name\add s were written\add* on \add each of\add* its heads.\x + \xo 13:1: a \xt Dan 7:3; \xo b \xt Rev 17:3,7-12.\x*
\rem /s1 The Beast out of the Sea
\v 2 The sea creature that I saw was like a leopard¦162555 with feet¦162558 like a bear and a mouth like a lion¦162569, and the dinosaur¦162575 gave it his power¦162577 and his throne¦162581 and wide-ranging authority¦162584.\x + \xo 13:2: \xt Dan 7:4-6.\x*
\v 3 One of the heads¦162593 of the sea creature looked as if someone had wounded it so that it had died, but that wound had healed¦162607 and as a result, all the people of the earth¦162616 marvelled¦162610 at the sea creature and \add obeyed\add* it.
\v 4 They worshipped the dinosaur¦162626 because¦162628 he had given authority¦162634 to the sea creature, and they worshipped the sea creature, saying¦162643, “Who is like this sea creature and who is able to battle against it?”
\p
\v 5 The sea creature was given a mouth¦162658 so it could speak¦162659 out arrogant and anti-God statements, and it was given authority¦162669 to act for three and a half years.\x + \xo 13:5-6: \xt Dan 7:8,25; 11:36.\x*
\v 6 So¦162678 it started speaking out anti-God statements, as well as speaking out against¦162687 God's name¦162692 and his¦162693 \add home and\add* those \add who live\add* in heaven¦162703.
\v 7 It was given permission to battle against the believers and to conquer them, and it¦162720 was given authority¦162721 over every¦162724 tribe¦162725 and people¦162727 and language and nation¦162732.\x + \xo 13:7: \xt Dan 7:21.\x*

\p
\v 11 Then¦162809 I saw¦162810 a second wild animal¦162812 come up from the earth¦162817. It had two¦162821 small horns¦162820 on its head like a lamb, but it spoke like a dinosaur¦162830.
\v 12 This land animal carries out all the orders¦162852 of the sea creature and¦162846 insists that the people who live on the earth¦162845 worship the sea creature—the one that almost died except its¦162866 wound¦162863 healed¦162861.
\v 13 The land animal also did amazing miracles and it even caused fire¦162873 to fall from the sky¦162882 down to the earth¦162889 that people¦162892 could see.
\v 14 The dinosaur gave¦162906 the land animal the power to do these miracles on behalf of the sea creature. The land animal used the miracles to deceive¦162894 the people who live on the earth, telling¦162912 them to make an idol that looked like the sea creature that had survived a sword¦162936 wound¦162929 that seemed to kill it.
\v 15 The dinosaur \add also\add* gave¦162941 the land animal the power to make that idol live and¦162958 so the idol that looked like the sea creature was able to speak¦162953. The land animal was able to execute anyone who refused to worship the idol
\v 16 and it¦162978 \add also\add* required each person, whether important or not, and whether rich or poor, free or slave¦162998, to have a mark on their right¦163012 hand¦163009 or on their forehead¦163018.
\v 17 Then the land beast ordered that no one could buy or sell anything if they don't¦163024 have that mark. The mark was the name of the sea creature or the number¦163050 that stood for its¦163053 name.
\p
\v 18 This \add calls for\add* wisdom¦163056: Let anyone who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, because¦163071 it's the number of a man¦163072 and¦163074 his number is 666.\f + \fr 13:18 \ft There are some manuscripts that have the number as 616 (XIS) rather than 666 (XES).

\v 6 Then¦163251 I saw another¦163254 messenger¦163255 flying¦163256 through the air, having¦163259 the good message that's eternal¦163261 to proclaim to those living¦163267 on the earth¦163270, even to every¦163273 nation¦163274 and tribe¦163276 and language and people¦163282,

\v 14 Then¦163544 I looked and wow¦163547, there was a white¦163549 cloud, and someone who looked like a human was sitting¦163555 on the cloud with a golden¦163571 crown¦163570 on his head and a sharp¦163578 sickle¦163577 (harvesting tool) in his hand¦163575.\x + \xo 14:14: \xt Dan 7:13.\x*

\v 5 and a name was written¦164735 on her¦164733 forehead¦164732. The name was a mystery: ‘Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth.’
\v 6 I noticed that the woman¦164753 was drunk¦164754 from the blood of the believers and from the blood of the witnesses¦164768 of \nd Yeshua\nd*. and, having¦164772 seen her, I wondered a great¦164775 wonder.

\v 8 The wild animal that you saw used to be \add here\add* and isn't \add anymore\add* but is about to come up from the abyss¦164823.
