\mt1 Revelation
\mt2 of Yeshua the messiah
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk Yohan's (John's) revelation of Yeshua (Jesus) the messiah\bk* concerns events that will happen in the future. This was written long ago in a time when the believers were persecuted due to their faith in the master Yeshua, the messiah, and Yohan himself had been forcibly exiled to Patmos Island by the Roman authorities and held there. Yohan's main purpose for writing this was to give hope to the believers and to encourage them to persevere in their faith despite their persecution.
\ip A major portion of what's written in this document is the revelation by Yeshua the messiah to Yohan of incredible signs and all those symbols have a meaning and interpretation. At the time of writing, some were likely understood by the Christians of the time, but now, some of the symbols are very hard to interpret, and there's been a large range of interpretations from different people. But even though it's like that, there are also some signs that are easier to understand like ‘horns’ which denote power and authority, and ‘sword’ which denotes war. The themes are repeated throughout this document in various different forms. But it's important to just understand the main points of what's written here: God will indeed destroy all of his enemies through the messiah Yeshua, and also, he will reward all his people who persevere in serving him, and then he'll bring them to live with him. The final major them concerns the new sky and earth that God will create, and concerning the new Yerushalem that will descend from heaven.

\rem /s1 Vision of the Son of Man; A Vision of Christ; One like a Son of Man
\p
\v 9 I, John, am your¦156574 brother¦156573 and partner in the suffering \add that's typical of those who follow\add* Yeshua. \add I've been exiled to\add* Patmos¦156601 Island where I endure¦156586 because¦156602 I believe God's message¦156605 and \nd Yeshua's\nd* testimony¦156611 and \add look forward to\add* his kingdom¦156584.
\v 10 One Sunday \add while meditating\add*, \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦156617\nd* gave me a vision, and¦156622 I heard¦156623 a voice¦156627 behind¦156625 me that seemed as loud¦156628 as a trumpet¦156632 blast
\v 11 that said, “Write down what you¦156649 see \add here\add* on a scroll¦156654 and send¦156656 it to the seven¦156658 assemblies¦156659 \add of believers\add*—to \add the cities of\add* Ephesus¦156664, Smyrna¦156667, Pergamum¦156671, Thyatira¦156674, Sardis¦156679, Philadelphia¦156682, and to Laodicea¦156685.”
\p
\v 12 Then¦156686 I turned to see who was talking¦156693 to me, and I saw¦156700 seven¦156701 golden¦156703 lamp holders,
\v 13 and standing among them was a man who looked like humanity's child,\f + \fr 1:13 \ft It's not certain what was meant here: either ‘a man who looked like humanity's child’ or ‘a form that looked like a human man’.\f* wearing a long robe with a golden¦156726 sash around His¦156715 chest.\x + \xo 1:13: a \xt Dan 7:13; \xo b \xt Dan 10:5.\x*
\v 14 His¦156732 hair¦156735 was gleaming white like wool or snow and his¦156732 eyes¦156745 were \add bright\add* like a fiery flame¦156748.\x + \xo 1:14: \xt Dan 7:9.\x*
\v 15 His¦156753 feet¦156752 shone like bronze¦156755 that had been refined¦156759 in a furnace¦156758, and his¦156753 voice was like the sound of a \add river of rushing\add* water¦156768.\x + \xo 1:15: \xt Eze 1:24; 43:2.\x*
\v 16 He was holding¦156771 seven¦156780 stars¦156779 in his right¦156775 hand¦156777 and a sharp¦156788 sword¦156786 was extending from his mouth¦156784, and his face¦156792 was like the sun¦156797 shining¦156798 at its¦156802 brightest.
\v 17 And when I saw¦156805 him, I quickly lay at his feet¦156811, \add breathless\add* like a dead¦156815 man, but he placed his right¦156820 hand¦156820 on me, and told me, “Don't be afraid. \em I am\em* the first¦156833 and the last.\x + \xo 1:17: \xt Isa 44:6; 48:12; Rev 2:8; 22:13.\x*

\v 2 “I know about your activities and work, and your endurance¦156964 and that you can not tolerate evil¦156971 people, and that you have investigated the ones calling themselves¦156978 missionaries but are not, and you have found¦156986 them to be frauds.
\v 3 \add I'm aware that\add* you've endured¦156992 and even suffered \add persecution\add* because¦156999 you've \add believed in\add* me, but you've never given up.
\v 4 However, I do have something against¦157011 you: you've abandoned the love¦157015 that you first¦157018 had.
\v 5 So¦157037 \add now, you need to\add* remember¦157023 where¦157025 you've fallen¦157026 from, and repent and repeat how you behaved at the beginning, but if you don't, I'll come to you and if you don't repent, I'll remove¦157044 your¦157047 lampstand¦157046 from its¦157051 place¦157050.
\v 6 But you do have this going for you: you hate what the \add disciples of\add* Nicolaus are doing,\f + \fr 2:7 \ft Nicolaus' disciples ate food that had been sacrificed to idols and committed sexual sins.\f* just like I do.

\v 10 Don't be afraid about what you're¦157163 going to suffer¦157165.

\v 14 But I do have a few things against¦157286 you: you have some people there¦157292 who hold to \add the ancient prophet\add* Balaam's teaching.\x + \xo 2:14: a \xt Num 22:5,7; 31:16; Deu 23:4; \xo b \xt Num 25:1-3.\x* He taught¦157295 \add Moab's king\add*, Balak¦157303, how to tempt¦157307 the Israelis and to eat \add food\add* that had been sacrificed¦157314 to idols, and to be sexually¦157316 immoral¦157316.

\v 15 “I'm aware of what you've been doing \add and\add* that you're¦158085 neither¦158083 hot nor cold. (You'd benefit\f + \fr 3:15 \ft TC: Some manuscripts don't have this parenthesised sentence at all, and some later manuscripts have ‘I wish’ instead of ‘You'd benefit’.\f* if you were hot or cold.)
\v 16 So because¦158096 you're¦158099 lukewarm¦158098, neither¦158101 hot nor cold¦158106, I'll spit you out of my¦158117 mouth¦158115.

\v 18 I advise you to buy gold¦158154 from me that's been refined¦158155 by fire¦158157 so that you might get rich, and buy white¦158162 clothes¦158161 so that you can dress yourself¦158164 so that the shame¦158169 of your nakedness¦158171 might not be displayed, and buy ointment to rub on your eyes¦158181 so that you'll be able to see.

\v 1 After¦158263 that, I looked¦158265 and wow, a door¦158268 opening in heaven¦158273, and the first¦158279 voice¦158277 that I'd heard¦158281 that sounded like a trumpet¦158283 told me, “Come up here and I'll show you what must happen after¦158300 those things.”
\v 2 Immediately¦158303 I was in the \nd spirit¦158306\nd* and wow, a throne was appearing in heaven¦158313 with someone sitting¦158321 on it.\x + \xo 4:2-3: \xt Eze 1:26-28; 10:1.\x*

\v 5 From the \add centre\add* throne came lightning¦158388 flashes and thunderous¦158393 sounds and voices¦158391.

\v 5 Then¦158705 one of the elders¦158709 said to me, “Stop crying. Look¦158714, here's the lion¦158717 from the tribe¦158722 of Judah.

\v 8 When he'd taken the scroll¦158804, the four living¦158807 creatures¦158807 and the twenty-four elders knelt down in from of the lamb. Each elder held a harp and a bowl that was full of incense¦158828 (which¦158829 symbolised the prayers¦158833 of the believers).\x + \xo 5:8: \xt Psa 141:2.\x*

\v 2 So¦159067 I looked¦159068, and wow, there was a white¦159072 horse¦159071 with someone sitting¦159075 on it holding a bow \add and arrow\add*. A crown¦159085 was given¦159083 to him, and then he went¦159087 out as a conqueror to conquer.\x + \xo 6:2: \xt Zech 1:8; 6:3,6.\x*

\p
\v 7 Then¦160176 the first¦160178 messenger blew his trumpet¦160180 and then hail and fire¦160185 mixed¦160186 together with blood¦160189 was thrown¦160191 \add down\add* on the earth and third of the earth was burnt up along with a third of the trees¦160205, and all the green¦160210 grass¦160209 got burnt up.\x + \xo 8:7: \xt Exo 9:23-25; Eze 38:22.\x*
\p
\v 8 Then¦160212 the second¦160214 messenger¦160215 blew his trumpet¦160216, and something¦160217 was thrown¦160223 into the ocean that was like a huge, burning mountains¦160219, and a third¦160231 of the sea turned into blood¦160234.
\v 9 One third of the living creatures¦160242 in the sea¦160246 died¦160236, and a third of the ships¦160255 were destroyed.
\p
\v 10 Then¦160258 the third messenger¦160261 blew his trumpet¦160262 and a huge star¦160268, burning like a torch¦160272, fell \add down\add* from the sky¦160267 and landed on a third of the rivers¦160279 and on the springs¦160283 of water¦160285.\x + \xo 8:10: \xt Isa 14:12.\x*
\v 11 That star¦160290 is named ‘Bitterness’ and a third¦160301 of those waters turned bitter¦160317. Many people¦160310 died from the waters, because¦160316 they \add became¦160298 poisonous\add*.\x + \xo 8:11: \xt Jer 9:15.\x*
\p
\v 12 Then¦160318 the fourth¦160320 messenger¦160321 blew his trumpet¦160322 and a third of the sun and the moon were struck and the sun didn't shine for a third of the day¦160346, nor the moon for a third of the night¦160361.

\p
\v 13 Then¦160363 as I watched, I heard¦160366 an eagle¦160368 that was flying¦160370 high in the sky, shouting loudly¦160375, “Three terrible things will happen to the people who're living¦160382 on the earth¦160385 when the three¦160393 remaining messengers¦160394 blow their trumpets¦160391.”

\s1 The fifth trumpet brings the first terror
\p
\v 1 Then¦160398 the fifth¦160400 messenger blew his trumpet¦160402 and I saw¦160404 a star that had fallen¦160410 from the sky¦160409 to the earth¦160414, and he/it\f + \fr 9:1 \ft It's ambiguous in the Greek whether the key was given to the messenger or the star, or possibly the falling star was the messenger.\f* was given the key to the deep, dark pit.
\v 2 When he/it \add unlocked and\add* opened¦160425 that pit, smoke came up out of it like the smoke of a large furnace¦160440, and the smoke darkened¦160445 the sun¦160447 and the air.\x + \xo 9:2: \xt Gen 19:8.\x*
\v 3 Then¦160456 locusts¦160461 came out of the smoke¦160459 and \add descended\add* on the land, and they were given¦160466 \add stinging\add* power like the large scorpions¦160474 of the earth.\x + \xo 9:3: \xt Exo 10:12-15.\x*
\v 4 \add However the locusts\add* were told that they¦160483 shouldn't harm the grass¦160486 or any green¦160492 plants or trees, but only those people¦160499 who didn't have God's mark on their¦160510 foreheads¦160511.\x + \xo 9:4: \xt Eze 9:4.\x*
\v 5 They weren't given¦160514 power to kill¦160519 them, but only to torment them for five¦160526 months¦160525, and their¦160530 torment was like that of a scorpion¦160533 when it strikes¦160536 a person¦160537.
\v 6 People in those¦160542 days¦160541 will try to die, but won't be able to—they will long to die, but death will run away from them.\x + \xo 9:6: \xt Yob 3:21; Jer 8:3.\x*
\p
\v 7 The locusts¦160574 looked like horses¦160578 that had been prepared¦160579 for battle, with something¦160582 on their heads¦160585 that were similar to golden crowns¦160588 and their faces being like human¦160598 faces.\x + \xo 9:7: \xt Yoel 2:4.\x*
\v 8 Their¦160609 hair was like women's¦160605 hair and their¦160609 teeth were like lions' teeth.\x + \xo 9:8: \xt Yoel 1:6.\x*
\v 9 They wore chestplates that seemed to be made of iron, and the sound of their¦160625 wings¦160624 was like the roar of many horses¦160629 rushing into battle pulling chariots¦160628.\x + \xo 9:9: \xt Yoel 2:5.\x*
\v 10 They had tails with stingers¦160641 like scorpions¦160639 which had the power¦160650 to harm people¦160657 for five¦160659 months¦160658.
\v 11 They had a king¦160668 in charge of them who's the messenger¦160671 of the deep pit—his name is ‘Destroyer’. (‘Abaddon¦160680’ in Hebrew and ‘Apollyon¦160691’ in Greek.)
\p
\v 12 The first terrible event has now passed, but there are still¦160700 two¦160702 more to follow.
\s1 The sixth trumpet brings the second terror
\p
\v 13 Then¦160707 the sixth¦160709 messenger¦160710 blew his trumpet¦160711 and¦160712 I heard¦160713 a voice¦160714 coming from the corners of the golden¦160723 altar¦160721 in front of \nd God¦160727\nd*,\x + \xo 9:13: \xt Exo 30:1-3.\x*
\v 14 that was telling the sixth¦160731 messenger (with the trumpet¦160738), “Release¦160740 the four¦160742 messengers that are tied up by the large Euphrates¦160755 River.”
\v 15 So¦160757 the four¦160761 messengers¦160762 who had been prepared¦160764 for this exact time were released to kill¦160778 a third¦160780 of humankind.
\v 16 I heard¦160798 someone say how many mounted soldiers there were—there were 200 million of them,
\v 17 and this is what the horses and their riders looked like in my vision¦160809: the soldiers \add wore\add* chestplates that were \add red like\add* fire, \add blue like\add* sapphire, and \add yellow like\add* sulfur. The heads of the horses were like lions' heads, and fire, smoke¦160840, and fumes of burning sulfur came out of their mouths¦160835.
\v 18 These three¦160846 plagues¦160847 (fire¦160858, smoke¦160862, and burning sulfur¦160866 coming out of their¦160872 mouths¦160871) killed¦160849 one third¦160852 of humankind
\v 19 because the horses' power¦160878 is in their mouths¦160888 and in their tails, because their tails are like snakes, having¦160905 heads¦160908 that injure¦160912 \add people\add*.
\p
\v 20 \add However,\add* the rest of humankind that hadn't been killed¦160920 by those plagues¦160923, didn't repent¦160929 of their¦160935 actions and didn't stop worshipping demons¦160941 and idols \add made\add* of gold and silver¦160950 and bronze¦160954 and stone¦160959 and wood—idols that can't see, can't hear¦160970, and can't walk¦160972.\x + \xo 9:20: \xt Psa 115:4-7; 135:15-17; Dan 5:23.\x*
\v 21 They \add also\add* didn't repent¦160975 of their murdering¦160979 or of their sorcery¦160984, nor of their sexual immorality or of their stealing.

\s1 The messenger and the small scroll
\rem /s1 The Angel with the Little Scroll; The Angel and the Small Scroll
\p
\v 1 Then¦160998 \add in the vision\add* I saw¦160999 another¦161000 powerful messenger¦161001 coming¦161003 down from heaven¦161006 wrapped in a cloud¦161008 and with a rainbow¦161012 above his head. His¦161018 face¦161022 was like the sun¦161026 and his feet¦161029 were like pillars¦161032 of fire¦161034,
\v 2 and he was holding a small¦161043 opened¦161045 scroll¦161043. He set his right¦161053 foot \add down\add* on the ocean and his left \add foot down\add* on the land
\v 3 and shouted in a loud¦161070 voice like a lion¦161072 roaring¦161073, and when he shouted, the seven¦161080 thunders¦161082 spoke¦161078 out in their own voices.
\v 4 When the seven thunders spoke, I was going¦161100 to write \add down what they said\add* but I heard¦161105 a voice¦161106 from heaven¦161110 that said, “Keep what the seven thunders have said secret, and don't¦161122 write it down.”
\p
\v 5 Then¦161126 the messenger¦161128 that I'd seen straddling the ocean and the land raised his¦161143 right¦161145 hand¦161141\x + \xo 10:5-7: \xt Exo 20:11; Deu 32:40; Dan 12:7; Amos 3:7.\x*
\v 6 and made an oath by the one living¦161153 through all the ages and who created¦161160 heaven¦161162 and everything in it and the earth¦161169 and everything in it, and the sea¦161176 and everything in it, saying, “There won't be any more delay,
\v 7 but¦161188 at the time when the seventh¦161195 messenger¦161196 will speak and blow his trumpet¦161202, then the hidden purposes of \nd God¦161209\nd* will come to be, just like he told his slaves¦161215 the prophets¦161221 \add long ago\add*.”
\p
\v 8 Then¦161223 the one whom I had heard¦161227 speak¦161232 from heaven¦161230 spoke to me again¦161231, saying¦161237, “Go and get the open scroll¦161242 from the hand¦161250 of the messenger¦161252 who is straddling the ocean and the land.”\x + \xo 10:8-10: \xt Exo 2:8–3:3.\x*
\v 9 So¦161262 I went¦161263 to the angel and asked him to give¦161270 me the little¦161275 scroll¦161275, and he answered, “Take it and eat it. At first it'll taste sweet¦161298 like honey¦161300, but afterwards it'll be uncomfortable in your¦161288 stomach¦161291.”
\v 10 So¦161301 I took¦161302 that little¦161305 scroll¦161305 from the angel's hand¦161309 and ate¦161327 it, and it tasted sweet¦161324 like honey¦161323, but my¦161320 stomach¦161332 hurt afterwards
\v 11 and they¦161335 told me, “You have to speak out God's message about many nations¦161346 and people¦161343 groups and language groups and kings¦161350.”

\p
\v 1 Then¦161354 I was given¦161355 a measuring¦161369 stick and told, “Go and message God's temple¦161371 and the altar¦161376 and the people who're worshipping there,\x + \xo 11:1: \xt Exo 40:3; Zech 2:1-2.\x*
\v 2 but exclude the outer courtyard¦161385. Don't measure¦161402 that because¦161403 it's been given¦161404 to the non-Jews, and they'll tread¦161413 \add around\add* the holy city¦161410 for three and a half years.\x + \xo 11:2: \xt Luk 21:24.\x*
\v 3 Then¦161420 I'll give my¦161425 two witnesses¦161424 \add the ability\add* to speak out God's message for six months, while dressed in mourning garb.
\p
\v 4 Those are the two olive¦161440 trees¦161440 and the two lampstands¦161445 that stand before¦161447 the \nd master¦161449\nd* of the earth¦161452.\x + \xo 11:4: \xt Zech 4:3,11-14.\x*

\v 6 Those witnesses have the power to stop the rain so that it doesn't rain while they're speaking out, and they have power to turn \add rivers and lakes\add* into blood¦161524, and to damage the earth¦161528 with every¦161530 type of plague¦161532 just as often¦161533 as they want.\x + \xo 11:6: a \xt 1Ki 17:1; \xo b \xt Exo 7:17-19; \xo c \xt 1Sam 4:8.\x*

\v 8 Their¦161578 corpses¦161576 will \add lie\add* on the road¦161581 of the great¦161585 city¦161583, which¦161586 in spiritual¦161588 terms is called¦161587 Sodom¦161589 and¦161590/or Egypt¦161591 \add (Mitsrayim)\add*—where¦161592 their¦161578 \nd master¦161595\nd* was executed¦161598 on a stake¦161598.\x + \xo 11:8: \xt Isa 1:9-10.\x*
\v 9 People from every nation¦161612 and tribe¦161608 and language will look at their corpses for three¦161620 and a half days¦161619 and will prevent their corpses from being put into a tomb¦161634.
\v 10 Those who're living¦161638 on the earth will be happy about it and celebrate and send gifts¦161650 to each another¦161654 because¦161656 those two¦161659 prophets¦161660 had tormented¦161664 them,
\v 11 but after¦161672 three¦161674 and a half days¦161675, God's breath of life¦161681 will enter into them and they'll stand up. The people who see that will be terrified.\x + \xo 11:11: \xt Eze 37:10.\x*
\v 12 Then the two witnesses will hear a loud voice¦161712 from the sky¦161729 telling them, “Come up here.” Then they'll go up to heaven¦161718 in a cloud¦161732 as their¦161739 enemies¦161738 watch them go up.\x + \xo 11:12: \xt 2Ki 2:11.\x*
\v 13 At that same time, there will be a huge earthquake which will cause a tenth¦161753 of the city¦161755 to collapse. That'll kill 7,000 people¦161763 and the rest will be terrified and will acknowledge the \nd God¦161777\nd* of heaven¦161779.\x + \xo 11:13: \xt Rev 6:12; 16:18.\x*

\v 14 The second¦161783 terror has then passed, but the third¦161791 will be coming¦161793 soon.

\p
\v 15 Then¦161795 the seventh¦161798 messenger¦161799 blew his trumpet¦161800, and voices¦161804 in heaven¦161808 shouted loudly, “The kingdom of the world¦161818 has become the kingdom of our¦161821 \nd master¦161820\nd* and of his \nd messiah¦161824\nd*, and he will reign¦161827 through all the ages.”\x + \xo 11:15: \xt Exo 15:18; Dan 2:44; 7:14,27.\x*
\v 16 The twenty-four elders¦161839 sitting¦161848 on their thrones¦161851 in front of God knelt down with their faces¦161858 to the ground and¦161860 worshipped God,

\v 8 however the dinosaur couldn't beat them, so after that they weren't able to stay in heaven¦162204 anymore¦162201.
\v 9 Thus the huge dinosaur was thrown \add out\add*—that ancient¦162216 snake called¦162218 ‘the devil’ and ‘Satan¦162222’—the one who deceived¦162224 the whole¦162227 world¦162226.

\v 13 When the dinosaur realised that God had thrown¦162362 him \add down\add* to the earth¦162365, he tried to attack the woman¦162371 who had given birth to the son.

\rem /s1 The Beast out of the Sea
\v 2 The sea creature that I saw was like a leopard¦162555 with feet¦162558 like a bear and a mouth like a lion¦162569, and the dinosaur gave it his power¦162577 and his throne¦162581 and wide-ranging authority¦162584.\x + \xo 13:2: \xt Dan 7:4-6.\x*
\v 3 One of the heads¦162593 of the sea creature looked as if someone had wounded it so that it had died, but that wound had healed¦162607 and as a result, all the people of the earth¦162616 marvelled¦162610 at the sea creature and \add obeyed\add* it.
\v 4 They worshipped the dinosaur because¦162628 he had given authority¦162634 to the sea creature, and they worshipped the sea creature, saying¦162643, “Who is like this sea creature and who is able to battle against it?”
\p
\v 5 The sea creature was given a mouth¦162658 so it could speak¦162659 out arrogant and anti-God statements, and it was given authority¦162669 to act for three and a half years.\x + \xo 13:5-6: \xt Dan 7:8,25; 11:36.\x*

\v 7 It was given permission to battle against the believers and to conquer them, and it¦162720 was given authority¦162721 over every¦162724 tribe¦162725 and people¦162727 and language and nation¦162732.\x + \xo 13:7: \xt Dan 7:21.\x*

\p
\v 11 Then¦162809 I saw¦162810 a second wild animal¦162812 come up from the earth¦162817. It had two¦162821 small horns¦162820 on its head like a lamb, but it spoke like a dinosaur.
\v 12 This land animal carries out all the orders¦162852 of the sea creature and¦162846 insists that the people who live on the earth¦162845 worship the sea creature—the one that almost died except its¦162866 wound¦162863 healed¦162861.
\v 13 The land animal also did amazing miracles and it even caused fire¦162873 to fall from the sky¦162882 down to the earth¦162889 that people¦162892 could see.
\v 14 The dinosaur gave¦162906 the land animal the power to do these miracles on behalf of the sea creature. The land animal used the miracles to deceive¦162894 the people who live on the earth, telling¦162912 them to make an idol that looked like the sea creature that had survived a sword¦162936 wound¦162929 that seemed to kill it.
\v 15 The dinosaur \add also\add* gave¦162941 the land animal the power to make that idol live and¦162958 so the idol that looked like the sea creature was able to speak¦162953. The land animal was able to execute anyone who refused to worship the idol
\v 16 and it¦162978 \add also\add* required each person, whether important or not, and whether rich or poor, free or slave¦162998, to have a mark on their right¦163012 hand¦163009 or on their forehead¦163018.
\v 17 Then the land beast ordered that no one could buy or sell anything if they don't¦163024 have that mark. The mark was the name of the sea creature or the number¦163050 that stood for its¦163053 name.
\p
\v 18 This \add calls for\add* wisdom¦163056: Let anyone who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, because¦163071 it's the number of a man¦163072 and¦163074 his number is 666.\f + \fr 13:18 \ft There are some manuscripts that have the number as 616 (XIS) rather than 666 (XES).

\v 5 and a name was written¦164735 on her¦164733 forehead¦164732. The name was a mystery: ‘Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and the Abominations of the Earth.’
\v 6 I noticed that the woman¦164753 was drunk¦164754 from the blood of the believers and from the blood of the witnesses¦164768 of \nd Yeshua\nd*. and, having¦164772 seen her, I wondered a great¦164775 wonder.
\p When I saw heard, I was incredibly amazed
\v 7 but the messenger¦164782 asked me, “Why are you astounded? I'll tell you the mystery¦164791 of the woman¦164793 and of the wild animal¦164796 with the seven¦164803 heads¦164804 and the ten¦164807 horns¦164808 that's carrying her¦164799.
\v 8 The wild animal that you saw used to be \add here\add* and isn't \add anymore\add* but is about to come up from the abyss¦164823.

\v 13 They're \add all unified\add*, and they¦164979 give their¦164976 power¦164971 and authority¦164974 to the wild animal¦164978.
\v 14 They'll go to battle against the lamb, but the lamb will conquer them because¦164991 he is \nd master¦164992\nd* of masters¦164993 and king¦164996 of kings¦164997 and the ones with him are called¦165002 and chosen¦165004 and faithful¦165006.”
\p
\v 15 Then¦165007 the angel said to me, “The waters¦165013 that you¦165015 saw¦165015, where¦165017 the prostitute¦165019 sits, are peoples¦165022 and multitudes and nations¦165027 and languages¦165029.

\v 11 Then¦166803 I saw¦166804 a large white¦166807 throne¦166805 with someone sitting¦166811 on it¦166814. Earth and sky fled from his presence but they couldn't find \add where to go\add*.\x + \xo 20:11-12: \xt Dan 7:9-10.\x*

\v 9 Then¦167213 one of the seven messengers¦167221 holding the seven bowls¦167226 full of the seven last plagues¦167233 came¦167214 and spoke¦167237 to me, saying¦167240, “Come, I'll show you the bride¦167247—the lamb's wife¦167249.”

\v 12 \add The city\add* had wall that was both wide and high¦167305, with twelve gates and twelve messengers¦167317 at the gates. The gates had the names¦167320 of the twelve tribes¦167330 (\add from\add* Israel's twelve sons¦167332) written on them.\x + \xo 21:12-13: \xt Eze 48:30-35.\x*
\v 13 There were three gates on the east, three on the north¦167341, three on the south¦167352, and three on the west.
\v 14 The city¦167364 wall had twelve foundation¦167367 \add stones\add*, and they had the names¦167375 of the lamb's twelve missionaries \add written\add* on them.
\p
\v 15 The \add messenger\add* speaking¦167383 to me had a golden¦167389 measuring rod so that he could measure the city¦167393 and its¦167397 gates¦167396 and wall.\x + \xo 21:15: \xt Eze 40:3.\x*
\v 16 The city was laid out square with the length equalling the width. Using the rod, the \add messenger\add* measured¦167419 the city at 2.2km \add on each edge\add*, with the length, width, and height¦167437 all being equal.
\v 17 He also measured the wall to be 70m using normal measurements.\f + \fr 21:17 \ft It's not stated if that's the \em height\em* or the \em thickness\em* of the city wall.\f*
\v 18 The wall was made of \add green\add* jasper¦167468 \add stone\add* and¦167469 the city¦167471 itself was pure gold¦167472 but as clear as glass¦167476.\x + \xo 21:18-21: \xt Isa 54:11-12.\x*
\v 19 The foundations of the city's wall were adorned¦167488 with \add many different kinds of\add* precious¦167487 stones¦167486. The first¦167493 foundation was jasper¦167494, the second¦167497 sapphire¦167498, the third¦167501 chalcedony¦167502, the fourth¦167504 emerald¦167505,

\v 21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls—each one of the gates individually was from one pearl—and the city¦167556 street was pure gold¦167557—transparent¦167562 like glass¦167560.

\v 22 I didn't see any temple in \add the city\add* because¦167573 the \nd master¦167574\nd*, the all-powerful \nd God¦167576\nd*, and¦167583 the lamb are its¦167581 temple.
\v 23 The city¦167588 doesn't need the sun¦167593 or moon¦167596 to illuminate it because¦167602 God's radiance illuminates it, and its¦167611 lamp is the lamb.\x + \xo 21:23: \xt Isa 60:19-20.\x*
