\is1 Introduction
\ip The document named \bk Sorrows\bk* (or in older English \bk Lamentations\bk*) is this collection of writings concerning the sorrow due to large destruction what happened of Yerushalem, and of capture of locals there, of 586 year(s) of not yet born the Master Yeshua. And/Now even still of sadness naheraman shown of this document, there is/are also shown concerning the trusting there to Master God and the hope of coming times. These poems were used by Jews\f + \fr 1:0 \ft The Jews the descendants of Yacob named just also to Israel. They were named Jews because they had lived in Yudea (Judea) long ago.\f* there to me worshipping at time of each year(s) fasting and sorrow until today, in order to mourn Yerushalem's destruction.
\ip Several of these sorrowful chapters are acrostic poems, i.e., the first verse starts with the first Hebrew letter (alef) and the second with the second Hebrew letter (beyt), etc. We have chosen to display those Hebrew letters to help the English reader understand that there is that acrostic background to the poem.

\q1
\v 4 The roads¦331523 of Tsiyyon¦331524 \add (Zion¦331524)\add* mourn¦331525—no one's coming to the \add ≈scheduled festivals\add*.

\q1
\v 5 Her enemies have become¦331545 \add ≈her masters¦331547\add*—her enemies prosper

\qa \bd כ\bd* (Kaf)
\q1

\q1
\v 17 Tsiyyon¦331815 has spread¦331814 her hands¦331816 wide—there¦331817 is no comforter¦331818 for her.
