\q1 \add ≈Despite having many\add* lovers¦331493, no one brings her comfort¦331490.
\q1 ≈All her friends¦331496 betrayed her—they've become¦331499 her enemies¦331501 \add instead\add*.
\qa \bd ג\bd* (Gimel)
\q1
\v 3 Yehudah¦331505 \add (Judah)\add* is exiled¦331504 \add and made to experience\add* suffering and harsh¦331507 slavery.
\q1 She sits among the nations¦331511 \add but\add* finds no rest.
\q1 All who pursue¦331517 her, overtake¦331518 her in the midst of distress¦331520.
\qa \bd ד\bd* (Dalet)
\q1
\v 4 The roads¦331523 of Tsiyyon¦331524 \add (Zion¦331524)\add* mourn¦331525—no one's coming to the \add ≈scheduled festivals\add*.
\q1 All her¦331531 gates¦331531 are desolate¦331532. Her priests¦331533 are groaning¦331534.
\q1 Her young¦331535 women¦331535 are grieving¦331536 and¦331539 she¦331539 makes herself bitter¦331540.
\qa \bd ה\bd* (He)
\q1
\v 5 Her enemies have become¦331545 \add ≈her masters¦331547\add*—her enemies prosper
\q1 because Yahweh¦331552 has made her suffer¦331553 due to her \add ≈frequent disobedience\add*.
\q1 Her children¦331558 \add ≈get taken away as captives¦331560 by the enemy\add*.
\qa \bd ו\bd* (Vav)
\q1
\v 6 All her¦331575 splendour was sent out from the daughter of Tsiyyon¦331572.
\q1 Her¦331575 \add ≈leaders\add* have become¦331576 like deer—they can't¦331579 find a pasture¦331582
\q1 \add ≈so\add* they \add ≈have very little strength¦331586 as they flee from\add* the pursuer¦331588.
\qa \bd ז\bd* (Zayin)
\q1
\v 7 Yerushalem¦331592 remembers¦331591 the days of her suffering and her homelessness,
\q1 all her treasures which¦331598 were from former days.
\q1 When her people¦331603 fell into the hand of the enemy and there was no one to help her,
\q1 her enemies saw her—they laughed¦331612 over her destruction.
\qa \bd ח\bd* (Khet)
\q1
\v 8 Yerushalem¦331619 \add ≈disobeyed terribly\add*, therefore, she became filth.
\q1 All her glory is scorned, because they've seen¦331631 her nakedness¦331632.

\qa \bd ט\bd* (Tet)
\q1
\v 9 Her¦331641 uncleanness¦331641 is in her skirt¦331642.
\q1 She didn't¦331643 remember¦331644 her end and her descent was marvellous.
\q1 There wasn't any comforter¦331649 for her.
\q1 “Oh, Yahweh¦331652, see¦331651 my suffering, because the enemy¦331658 is powerful.”
\qa \bd י\bd* (Yod)
\q1
\v 10 The enemy spread¦331662 his hand¦331661 over all her treasures.
\q1 So, she saw¦331670 the nations¦331671; they entered her sanctuary¦331673—
\q1 those who you \add ≈had forbidden to\add* enter into your \add ≈gathering place\add*.
\qa \bd כ\bd* (Kaf)
\q1
\v 11 All her¦331685 people¦331685 are groaning¦331686, searching for bread¦331688.
\q1 They give their¦331690 treasures¦331690 to restore life¦331695 with food.
\q1 “O, Yahweh¦331697, look and see, for I have become worthless¦331701.
\qa \bd ל\bd* (Lamed)
\q1
\v 12 Is it¦331718 nothing to you, all those going past on the road¦331709?
\q1 Look and see¦331711 if there¦331714 is any sorrow like my sorrow, which has been forced on me,
\q1 which Yahweh¦331722 inflicted on the day¦331723 of his fierce anger¦331725.
\qa \bd מ\bd* (Mem)
\q1
\v 13 He sent¦331729 fire¦331731 dwon from on high¦331728 into my bones¦331732.
\q1 He spread¦331734 a net¦331735 for my feet¦331736 and¦331733 turned¦331737 me away.

\qa \bd נ\bd* (Nun)
\q1
\v 14 The yoke of my \add ≈disobedience\add* is bound¦331747.
\q1 \add ≈With his hand¦331750 it's assembled together¦331751 and placed\add* on my neck.
\q1 My strength¦331757 is \add gone so now I\add* stumble.
\q1 My master¦331759 \add ≈arranged for me to be captured and I couldn't defend myself.\add*
\qa \bd ס\bd* (Samek)
\q1
\v 15 My master has rejected all my mighty¦331770 \add ≈warriors protecting me\add*.
\q1 He has \add ≈told us exaxtly when he plans\add* to destroy my young¦331778 men¦331778.
\q1 My master has \add ≈stomped on the grapes\add* for Yehudah's¦331785 virgin¦331782 daughter¦331783.

\v 16 \add ≈As a result\add* of those things, I weep.
\q1 My eyes, oh dear, my eyes overflow with water¦331798
\q1 because the comforter¦331803 is far from me—one who restores¦331804 my life.
\q1 My sons have become desolate¦331808, because the enemy¦331811 is made mighty.”
\qa \bd פ\bd* (Pe)
\q1
\v 17 Tsiyyon¦331815 has spread¦331814 her hands¦331816 wide—there¦331817 is no comforter¦331818 for her.
\q1 Yahweh¦331821 commanded¦331820 that those surrounding Yakov¦331822 become his enemies.
\q1 Yerushalem¦331826 has become filth¦331827 in \add ≈the middle of them\add*.
\qa \bd צ\bd* (Tsade)
\q1
\v 18 “Yahweh¦331833 is surely righteous¦331831, \add ≈but\add* I disobeyed his command¦331835.
\q1 Hear, all peoples, and see my sorrow.
\q1 My young men and women¦331846 have been taken into captivity¦331849.
\qa \bd ק\bd* (Qof)
\q1
\v 19 I called¦331852 to my lovers¦331853 \add but\add* they deceived¦331855 me.
\q1 My priests¦331856 and my elders¦331857 perished¦331859 in the city¦331858,
\q1 while they searched for food \add ≈to stay alive\add*.
\qa \bd ר\bd* (Resh)
\q1
\v 20 Look, O Yahweh¦331872, because I'm engulfed—my¦331882 stomach¦331878 churns.
\q1 My¦331882 heart¦331881 is undone within¦331882 me, because I've disobeyed grievously.
\q1 Out in the street¦331886, the sword¦331889 bereaves¦331887.
\q1 Inside the house¦331890, \add ≈there's\add* death¦331891.
\qa \bd ש\bd* (Sin/Shin)
\q1
\v 21 \add ≈Take notice\add* because I'm groaning¦331896.
\q1 There's no comforter¦331899 for me.
\q1 All my enemies¦331903 heard my trouble¦331905—they rejoiced¦331906 that you did it.
\q1 You brought¦331910 about the day¦331911 \add of punishment\add* that you declared,
\q1 \add yet may those persecutors\add* become¦331914 like me.
\qa \bd ת\bd* (Tav)
\q1
\v 22 May all their¦331921 evil \add ≈be noticed by\add* you,
\q1 and deal with them just as you have dealt¦331926 with me because of all my \add ≈disobedience\add*,

\v 1 Oh dear, how my master¦331944 engulfed the daughter¦331947 of Tsiyyon¦331949 in his anger.
\q1 He's thrown¦331950 Yisrael's splendour¦331953 down from heaven¦331951 to earth¦331952.
\q1 And he hasn't remembered¦331957 the footstool¦331958 of his feet on the day of his anger.
\qa \bd ב\bd* (Beyt)
\q1
\v 2 The Lord devoured—he didn't show compassion on all the pastures of Yakov.
\q1 In his fury, he \add ≈knocked\add* down the fortifications¦331977 of the daughter¦331978 of Yehudah¦331980.
\q1 He struck the earth with disgrace—the kingdom¦331984 and its \add ≈leaders\add*.
\qa \bd ג\bd* (Gimel)
\q1
\v 3 With fierce¦331989 anger¦331993 he cut off \add ≈all of Yisrael's power\add*.
\q1 He \add ≈stopped using his strength to protect her from\add* the enemy¦332001.
\q1 And he has burned¦332002 Yakov—it consumed¦332006 the surroundings like a fire¦332004.
\qa \bd ד\bd* (Dalet)
\q1
\v 4 He's bent his bow like an enemy¦332012.
\q1 His \add ≈sword\add* hand¦332014 is posed like an adversary.
\q1 And he has slain¦332016 all those precious to the eye¦332020 in the tent of the daughter¦332022 of Tsiyyon¦332024.
\q1 He has poured¦332025 out his rage like fire¦332026.
\qa \bd ה\bd* (He)
\q1
\v 5 My master¦332031 has become¦332030 like an enemy¦332033—he's swallowed up Yisrael.
\q1 He has swallowed up all her palaces¦332039—he's destroyed its fortifications.
\q1 And he has multiplied¦332042 mourning¦332046 and lamentation¦332047 within the daughter¦332043 of Yehudah¦332045.
\qa \bd ו\bd* (Vav)
\q1
\v 6 And he was violent with his garden¦332051 tabernacle—he ruined¦332053 his appointed place¦332054.
\q1 Yahweh¦332056 has caused¦332055 the appointed festival and Sabbath to be forgotten¦332055 in Tsiyyon¦332058.
\q1 And he has despised¦332061 the king¦332065 and priest¦332066 in his indignant¦332062 anger¦332064.
\qa \bd ז\bd* (Zayin)
\q1
