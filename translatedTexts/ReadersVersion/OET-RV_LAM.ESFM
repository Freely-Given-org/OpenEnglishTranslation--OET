\is1 Introduction
\ip The document named \bk Sorrows\bk* (or in older English \bk Lamentations\bk*) is this collection of poems or sad songs describing the people's sorrow at the terrible destruction that had happened to Yerushalem, and the capture of it inhabitants 586 year before Yeshua (B.C.). However, despite the sadness displayed by these compositions, it's also possible to see hope shown through trusting Yahweh God and the hope of a better future. These poems were used by Jews\f + \fr 1:0 \ft The Jews were the descendants of Yakov (Jacob) who was later named ‘Israel’. They were named Jews because they had lived in Yudea (Judea) long ago.\f* there in worship at time of fasting and sorrow each year, until today, in order to mourn Yerushalem's destruction.
\ip Several of these sorrowful chapters are acrostic poems, i.e., the first verse starts with the first Hebrew letter (alef) and the second with the second Hebrew letter (beyt), etc. We have chosen to display those Hebrew letters to help the English reader understand that there is that acrostic background to the poem.

\q1
\v 4 The roads¦331523 of Tsiyyon¦331524 \add (Zion¦331524)\add* mourn¦331525—no one's coming to the \add ≈scheduled festivals\add*.

\q1
\v 5 Her enemies have become¦331545 \add ≈her masters¦331547\add*—her enemies prosper

\q1
\v 17 Tsiyyon¦331815 has spread¦331814 her hands¦331816 wide—there¦331817 is no comforter¦331818 for her.
