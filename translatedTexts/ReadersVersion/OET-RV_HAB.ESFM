\is1 Introduction
\ip In this document, we can read the prophet Havakkuk's (Habakkuk's) discussions about Yahweh God. Havakkuk lived in Yehudah and this document was likely written by 600 B.C. Havakkuk questions God as to why he punishes his Israeli relatives when they're more godly people than those who attack them. Yahweh answered that he sent armies from Babylon in order to punishment them. At that time, the Babylonians solders were very feared because they were very fierce and had already defeated Assyia and Egypt. Havakkuk didn't understand why his master Yahweh would allow that. He also asked God, “Why are you silent while the wicked \add ≈destroy\add* those who're more \add ≈godly\add* than them?” (1:13). God answered that he would step in and help in due course: “…godly people live by their faith.” (2:4)
\ip The other part of this document is the prophecy about the coming destruction of evil people. Havakkuk still fears God's curse on Yehudah, but he trusting that his people would be saved and given of strength to endure the difficulties that they were experiencing. This document finishes with a song praising the Yahweh for his faithfulness.

\v 3 Why do I have to keep seeing injustice¦373831 and looking at trouble¦373832?
\q1 ≈Destruction and violence¦373835 are \add ≈all around\add*—there's \add such\add* strife¦373838, and conflicts \add ≈keep happening\add*.
\q1
\v 4 That's why the law is paralysed¦373845 and¦373847 why justice doesn't prevail¦373849—
\q1 because those who do good are surrounded¦373854 by wicked¦373853 \add >people\add*, so justice gets perverted¦373863.

\v 8 Their horses¦373910 are faster than leopards¦373909
\q2 and more menacing¦373911 than the wolves¦373912 in the evening¦373913.
