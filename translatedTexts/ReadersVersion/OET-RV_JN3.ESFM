\rem /s1 Gaius Commended for His Hospitality
\p
\v 2 My dear friend, I trust that you are healthy¦154493 and doing well in everything just as you are also doing well spiritually.
\v 3 I was very happy when some of our \add spiritual\add* brothers¦154503 came and told us about your¦154507 faithfulness to the truth and how you are living it out.
\v 4 Nothing makes me more happy than hearing¦154524 that other believers that I've helped are living out the truth¦154530.

\v 5 My dear friend, you are faithful¦154533 in what you do for other believers¦154541. Even strangers¦154546
\v 6 have told the assembly¦154553 about your¦154549 caring for them before¦154552 sending them on. Your¦154549 actions will be praised by \nd God¦154563\nd*
\v 7 because¦154565 they¦154570 went¦154570 out to serve God, not getting any help from the unbelievers.
\v 8 We should be supporting¦154580 believers like them so that we may also become¦154586 their workmates in sharing the truth¦154590.
\s1 Diotrephes and Demetrius
\p
\v 9 I wrote¦154591 something¦154593 to the assembly¦154595, but Diotrephes¦154600 won't¦154601 listen to us—he always wants the limelight for himself.
\v 10 Because¦154604 of that, if I do end up coming, I will be reminding¦154609 him about what he's been doing¦154614—rambling¦154617 on against¦154617 us with evil¦154616 talks, and then, not being¦154622 happy with that, he doesn't accept other believers¦154629 and expels them from the assembly¦154638 then forbids¦154634 others from accepting¦154627 them either.
\p
\v 11 My dear friend, don't¦154641 copy the evil things \add that others do\add*, just the good things. Anyone who does what is good belongs to God—anyone who does evil things has not seen¦154658 God.
\p
\v 12 Demetrius¦154661 has been talked about by everyone and even the truth¦154672 itself¦154667 speaks. We have also spoken about him, and you¦154679 know that what we¦154674 say is true.

\p
\v 13 I had many things I wanted to write¦154692 about, but¦154694 won't¦154695 do it by means of ink¦154699 and¦154700 pen¦154701,
\v 14 but¦154707 instead I hope to see¦154711 you¦154710 soon and¦154712 then we¦154717 can speak¦154717 face to face.
\p
\v 15 Wishing all peace and happiness for you. \add Your\add* friends here also greet you. Please greet \add our\add* friends there by name.
