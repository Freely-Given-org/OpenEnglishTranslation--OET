\rem /s1 Gaius Commended for His Hospitality
\p
\v 2 My dear friend, I trust that you are healthy¦155501 and doing well in everything just as you are also doing well spiritually.
\v 3 I was very happy when some of our \add spiritual\add* brothers¦155511 came and told us about your¦155515 faithfulness to the truth and how you are living it out.
\v 4 Nothing makes me more happy than hearing¦155532 that other believers that I've helped are living out the truth¦155538.

\v 5 My dear friend, you are faithful¦155541 in what you do for other believers¦155548. Even strangers¦155553
\v 6 have told the assembly¦155560 about your¦155556 caring for them before¦155559 sending them on. Your¦155556 actions will be praised by \nd God¦155570\nd*
\v 7 because¦155572 they¦155577 went¦155577 out to serve God, not getting any help from the unbelievers.
\v 8 We should be supporting¦155587 believers like them so that we may also become¦155593 their workmates in sharing the truth¦155597.
\s1 Diotrephes and Demetrius
\p
\v 9 I wrote¦155598 something¦155600 to the assembly¦155602, but Diotrephes¦155607 won't¦155608 listen to us—he always wants the limelight for himself.
\v 10 Because¦155611 of that, if I do end up coming, I will be reminding¦155616 him about what he's been doing¦155621—rambling¦155624 on against¦155624 us with evil¦155623 talks, and then, not being¦155629 happy with that, he doesn't accept other believers¦155636 and expels them from the assembly¦155645 then forbids¦155641 others from accepting¦155634 them either.
\p
\v 11 My dear friend, don't¦155648 copy the evil things \add that others do\add*, just the good things. Anyone who does what is good belongs to God—anyone who does evil things has not seen¦155665 God.
\p
\v 12 Demetrius¦155668 has been talked about by everyone and even the truth¦155679 itself¦155674 speaks. We have also spoken about him, and you¦155686 know that what we¦155681 say is true.

\p
\v 13 I had many things I wanted to write¦155699 about, but¦155701 won't¦155702 do it by means of ink¦155706 and¦155707 pen¦155708,
\v 14 but¦155714 instead I hope to see¦155718 you¦155717 soon and¦155719 then we¦155724 can speak¦155724 face to face.
\p
\v 15 Wishing all peace and happiness for you. \add Your\add* friends here also greet you. Please greet \add our\add* friends there by name.
