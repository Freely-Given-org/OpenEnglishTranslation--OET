\mt3 rebuilds Yerushalem's walls
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk Nehemyah\bk* (Nehemiah) was a servant of Persian King Artahshashta (Artaxerxes) in the city of Susa. While he was there, he heard an account from some Israelis who'd been allowed to return back to Yerushalem (Jerusalem) about how hard it was to live there. Yahweh's temple had been rebuilt, however the city wall hadn't been fixed yet, so their enemies who surrounded them were easily able to ambush and attack them.
\ip Because of that, Nehemyah requested permission from the king to go personally to Yerushalem to supervise the rebuilding of the city walls.
\ip In this document we read how God helped Nehemyah of organise the rebuild of the city wall in the middle of the opposition from their enemies around them.

\v 1 The account by Hakalyah's son Nehemyah¦221830 \add (Nehemiah¦221830)\add*.
\s1 Nehemyah's prayer for Yerushalem
\rem /s1 Nehemiah's Concern for Jerusalem
\p In the month¦221835 of Kislev¦221837 during the twentieth¦221840 year¦221839 \add of the reign of King Artahshashta (Artaxerxes) over the Persian Empire\add*, I was in the capital city of Shushan¦221843 \add (Susa¦221843)\add*.
\v 2 Hanani¦221847, one of my brothers¦221849, came¦221846 \add ≈with some other\add* men¦221851 from Yehudah¦221852, and I asked¦221853 them about the Jews who'd escaped¦221857 \add ≈and managed to avoid being exiled\add*, and about Yerushalem¦221866,
\v 3 and he told me, “The ones left behind in the provinces¦221878 and who \add ≈avoided\add* the captivity¦221876, are in \add ≈a bad way and feeling depressed\add*. The wall around Yerushalem¦221883 was torn down, and its gates¦221885 were burnt.”
\p
\v 4 When I heard¦221890 \add ≈all that\add*, I sat¦221896 down and I \add ≈was upset for days¦221899\add*. I fasted and cried and prayed¦221902 to the God¦221904 of the heavens¦221905,
\v 5 and I said, “Oh Yahweh¦221909, God of the heavens¦221911, the great¦221913 and awesome¦221914 God, who keeps¦221915 \add &his\add* agreement and \add ≈is determinedly loyal\add* to those who love him and \add ≈obey his instructions\add*:
\v 6 Please listen¦221930 \add ≈carefully\add* to your servant's prayer¦221933 that I'm \add ≈presenting to you\add* today, day and night¦221941, on account of your servants the \add ≈Israelis\add*. \add ≈On behalf of all Israelis\add*, I'm confessing¦221947 that we've sinned against you—\add ≈both my generation and previous generations\add*.
\v 7 We've acted¦221964 extremely corruptly—\add ≈disobeying\add* you by not \add ≈obeying your\add* commands¦221971, statutes¦221974, and judgments that you \add ≈instructed¦221979 through\add* your servant¦221983 Mosheh¦221982.
\v 8 Please remember \add ≈that you told\add* your servant¦221996 Mosheh¦221995 \add ≈that if we act unfaithfully¦221999, you yourself would scatter¦222001 us\add* among the nations,\x + \xo 1:8: \xt Lev 26:33.\x*
\v 9 \add ≈but if we'd return¦222005 to you and obey your instructions, then even if we had been banished to the ends of the earth, you'd gather¦222018 us back up and bring¦222019 us back to the place¦222023 where¦222024 you've established your name¦222029 and reputation\add*.\x + \xo 1:9: \xt Deu 30:1-5.\x*
\p
\v 10 “\add ≈We're your\add* servants¦222033 and your people¦222034 that you¦222036 \add ≈rescued from slavery\add* with your \add ≈incredible power¦222037\add*.
\v 11 Oh, my master¦222043, please \add ≈listen carefully\add* to your servant's prayer, and to the prayer of your \add other\add* servants who delight¦222057 to \add ≈honour\add* your name¦222061. Please¦222042 cause your servant to succeed¦222062 today, and give \add ≈me favour in the king's eyes\add*.”
\p Now as for me, I was the king's cupbearer.

\p
\v 1 In the \add ≈spring\add* of the twentieth¦222083 year of King Artahshashta's reign, I \add ≈was serving\add* wine to the king. \add ≈I'd never looked sad before¦222087 in his presence¦222098\add*,
\v 2 and the king¦222102 \add ≈asked\add* me, “Why \add ≈do you look unhappy\add*? \add ≈I know that\add* you're¦222108 not sick¦222109 \add ≈so something must be upsetting you\add*.”
\p I was very scared
\v 3 and I \add ≈answered\add* the king, “May the king live forever¦222124. \add ≈I can't¦222127 help but look unhappy when the city¦222132 containing my ancestors' graves has had its gates¦222138 burnt down and it's now abandoned\add*.”\x + \xo 2:3: \xt 2Ki 25:8-10; 2Ch 36:19; Jer 52:12-14.\x*
\v 4 “\add ≈So what would you¦222151 like to happen\add*?” the king¦222145 \add ≈asked\add*.
\p Then I prayed¦222153 to the God¦222156 of heaven¦222157
\v 5 and \add ≈answered\add* the king, “If \add ≈I have your favour, and if it seems\add* good to the king, \add maybe\add* you'd send me to Yehudah¦222176—to the city¦222179 of my ancestors' graves \add ≈so I could\add* rebuild¦222182 it.”
\p
\v 6 Then¦222184 the king said to me, with the queen¦222187 sitting¦222189 beside¦222190 him, “\add ≈How long would\add* your journey¦222195 be? And when would you return¦222197?” \add ≈So¦222184 I gave him a date and he seemed happy with it, because he released me to go\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add ≈Then¦222207 I made another request\add*, “If it \add ≈pleases\add* the king, let letters¦222215 be given to me for the governors¦222221 of \add ≈the provinces across the Euphrates river¦222223 to ask them to help me in my travel towards\add* Yehudah¦222232.
\v 8 \add Also\add* a letter¦222234 to Asaf¦222237, the keeper of the king's forest¦222239, so he'll give me timber for the beams¦222247 of the gates¦222250 of the fortress¦222251 \add ≈near the temple\add*, and for the city¦222256 wall, and for the house \add ≈that I'll live in\add*.” Then¦222234 the king \add ≈granted¦222262 those requests, thanks to God's help on what I was doing\add*.

\p
\v 9 Then¦222272 I went¦222272 to the governors¦222275 of \add ≈the provinces across the Euphrates\add*, and I gave them the king's letters¦222282. The king had sent army officers and horsemen with me.
\v 10 When Sanvallat¦222293 the Horonite and the servant Toviyyah¦222295 the Ammonite¦222297 heard \add >my plans\add*, \add ≈they were very angry that someone¦222305 would come¦222304 to help the Israelis¦222309\add*.
\rem /s1 Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem's Wall; Nehemiah Inspects Jerusalem's Walls; Nehemiah's Inspection of the Walls
\p
\v 11 \add ≈So¦222311\add* I \add ≈got\add* to Yerushalem¦222314 and¦222315 was there¦222317 for three¦222319 days¦222318,
\v 12 \add ≈One night¦222323, I got up and took a few men¦222325 with me, without having told anyone what I felt that my God¦222334 had been telling me\add* to do for Yerushalem¦222340. \add ≈We only had the one horse\add* that I was riding¦222350,
\v 13 and we went¦222353 out \add ≈in the dark\add* through the Valley Gate and past the Dragon Well to the Dung Gate. I was \add ≈carefully inspecting\add* the \add *city\add* walls¦222369—\add ≈noting\add* where they¦222376 were broken down and which¦222371 gates¦222375 had been burnt out.
\v 14 Then¦222379 I crossed to the Fountain Gate and the Royal Pool, but there¦222388 was nowhere that we could get my mount¦222391 through \add the rubble\add*.
\v 15 \add ≈So¦222395\add* I went up the creek bed \add ≈in the dark, carefully inspecting\add* the wall, before turning back and returning¦222406 \add quietly\add* through the Valley Gate.
\p
\v 16 \add ≈None of the city officials\add* knew where¦222411 I'd gone or what I was doing¦222415, and \add up until¦222423 this point\add* I hadn't yet told \add >my plans\add* to the Jewish \add leaders\add* or the priests¦222417 or nobles¦222418 or city officials, or \add ≈hired any workers\add*.
\rem /s1 Decision to Restore the Walls
\v 17 \add ≈So now\add* I told them, “You call all see the \add ≈desperate situation\add* that we're in: Yerushalem¦222438 is \add ≈in ruins\add* and its¦222440 gates¦222440 have been burned¦222441 out. \add ≈So now,\add* let's rebuild¦222444 the \add *city\add* wall and then we'll no longer be \add ≈mocked by others\add*.”
\v 18 I told them how God¦222460 \add ≈had helped\add* me \add so far\add* and what the king¦222469 had \add ≈given me permission to do\add*.
\p “\add Well,\add* \add ≈let's get started on the rebuilding\add*,” they¦222474 said¦222474, and \add ≈got ready to work together\add*.
\v 19 \add ≈But then\add* Sanvallat the Horonite, and the Ammonite¦222488 servant Toviyyah, and Geshem¦222489 the Arabian¦222490 heard, and they mocked¦222491 and despised¦222493 us, saying, “What \add ≈are you guys all up to\add*? Are you all rebelling¦222506 against¦222503 the king¦222504?”
\p
\v 20 I \add ≈answered them by explaining\add*, “The God¦222513 of the heavens¦222514 will \add ≈help\add* us to succeed¦222516, and we ourselves, his servants¦222519, will \add ≈do the rebuilding work\add*, but you¦222522 all will have \add ≈no part in it, and no rights¦222526\add* in Yerushalem¦222528.”

\s1 The opposition to Nehemyah
\rem /s1 Nehemiah Overcomes Opposition to His Work; Opposition to the Rebuilding; Hostile Plots Thwarted; Enemies Oppose the Rebuilding
\p
\v 1 When Sanballat¦223259 heard¦223258 that we were rebuilding the wall, he got really angry. He mocked the Jews
\v 2 and he spoke before \add ≈in front\add* of his brothers and the army of Samaria, “What are those feeble Jews doing? \add ≈Do they think they'll be able to rebuild that place\add* themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they \add ≈get finished one\add* day? Will they form the stones \add ≈back together¦223282\add* from piles of dust, when they've been \add ≈weakened by the heat of the fires\add*?”
\p
\v 3 Toviyyah the Ammonite was \add ≈standing beside him and confirmed\add*, “Yes, even if a fox \add ≈walked over\add* that stone wall that they're building, it would make \add ≈it fall down\add*.”
\p
\v 4 \add I prayed,\add* “Our God, \add ≈listen to how we're mocked\add* and cause their \add ≈words\add* to return on their \add own\add* heads and \add ≈send them away as captives to become the plunder for another country\add*.
\v 5 Don't just cover over their evil, and don't¦223319 \add ≈just ignore their sin\add*, because they've \add repeatedly\add* \add ≈made the workers get angry\add*.”
\p
\v 6 \add ≈So¦223341 we kept on at building\add* the wall, and \add eventually\add* all the wall was joined together \add ≈at about half its height\add*, and \add ≈so the people were encouraged to keep persevering\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add ≈Now\add* when Sanballat, and Toviyyah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the Yerushalem walls \add ≈were getting repaired\add* and the breaks were beginning to be closed up, it \add ≈made them extremely angry\add*
\v 8 and they all got together to come to \add ≈attack\add* Yerushalem and \add ≈to throw us into confusion\add*.
\v 9 \add ≈So\add* we¦223427 prayed to our¦223414 God, \add ≈as well as setting up a 24-hour guard to watch out for\add* them.
\p
\v 10 \add ≈People around Yehudah¦223458\add* said, “The \add ≈workers are running out of\add* strength and there's \add ≈a lot of\add* rubble \add still to be moved\add*. \add ≈Maybe we're not up to building this\add* wall.”
\p
\v 11 Then \add ≈those against us\add* said, “\add ≈We'll rush in among them and kill some of them before they even see us or know that we're coming\add*, then \add ≈that will bring the work to an end\add*.”
\v 12 \add ≈After\add* that, whenever the Jews living close to them came, they \add ≈repeatedly warned us\add*, “\add ≈They're going to attack us from all directions\add*.”
\v 13 \add ≈So\add* I stationed \add guards\add* behind the lowest places along the wall \add ≈and where there were still gaps\add*. I \add also\add* \add ≈made sure that the families stood guard\add* with their swords, spears, and bows.
\p
\v 14 I looked then I \add ≈got organised\add* and told the nobles and the prefects, and the rest of the people, “Don't be afraid of their \add ≈threats\add*. Remember my \add ≈powerful\add* and fearsome master, and fight¦223523 for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.”
\v 15 \add ≈After all that\add*, when our enemies \add ≈realised that we were aware of their intentions and that God had frustrated their surprise attack plan\add*, \add ≈we all returned to our work on\add* the wall.
\p
\v 16 \add ≈So from that day¦223555 onwards\add*, half of my young men would \add ≈work on the rebuilding, while the other half stood guard¦223554 with\add* spears, shields, and breastplates, and the officials \add ≈encouraged them all from behind\add*.
\v 17 \add Both¦223560\add* those who were \add ≈placing the stones on\add* the wall and those who were carrying the heavy loads \add to them\add*, \add always\add* \add ≈had their weapons¦223573 with them\add* \add in case of an attack\add*.
\v 18 The builders \add ≈had their swords strapped to their sides as they worked\add*, and \add ≈the man who would sound the trumpet stayed with\add* me.
\v 19 Then I told the nobles and prefects, and the rest of the people, “\add ≈This job is so large and extensive that we're all separated from each other when we work on\add* the wall,
\v 20 \add so\add* whenever you all hear the trumpet blast, join us at that place. Our God will fight for us.”
\v 21 \add ≈So\add* we \add ≈continued the work with\add* half of them keeping their hands on their spears from the \add ≈beginning of the day\add* until the stars came out \add at night\add*.

\p
\v 3 \add ≈Others\add* said, “We are mortgaging¦223606 our fields¦223602 and vineyards¦223603, and our houses¦223604 so we¦223605 can get grain¦223608 during this famine¦223609.”
\p
\v 4 \add ≈Yet others\add* said, “We've borrowed¦223614 silver \add to pay the tax¦223616\add* on our fields¦223618 and our vineyards¦223619 \add ≈that goes to the tribute to be paid to\add* the \add foreign\add* king¦223617.

\p
\v 6 I got very angry when I heard¦223651 their¦223654 \add ≈complaints and¦223655 desperation\add*,

\v 9 “It's not good¦223720 what you're doing¦223725,” I \add ≈continued\add*. “Shouldn't you all \add ≈respect and obey\add* our God¦223728, because \add ≈otherwise we'll be despised by the other\add* nations¦223731, our enemies¦223732.
\v 10 I¦223736 myself have lent them money¦223741 and grain¦223742, as have my brothers¦223737 and my young men, \add but\add* please¦223745 let's forgo charging interest¦223748.

\p
\v 12 “\add ≈Okay, we'll do what you're¦223777 asking\add*,” they \add ≈responded¦223769\add*. “We'll return¦223770 \add >their property\add* and we \add ≈won't¦223772 impose any more charges on\add* them.”

\v 10 Then¦225382 \add @Nehemyah\add* told them, “Go \add home and\add* eat¦225385 \add ≈some special food with sweet¦225388 drink¦225387\add*, and \add ≈share some with\add* those \add ≈who can't¦225399 afford such things¦225388\add* because today is \add ≈a sacred¦225396 day¦225397 that\add* belongs to our master¦225398.

\v 18 \add @Ezra\add* read aloud from the scroll of God's¦225568 instructions each day of the seven¦225582 days¦225583 of celebration¦225579, then on the eighth¦225585 day they all gathered together as per the instructions.

\v 4 \add ≈Prior to that time,\add* the high priest¦227975 Elyashiv (closely related to Toviyyah) had been in charge of the \add ≈temple storerooms\add*
\v 5 and he'd \add ≈allowed\add* \add ?@Toviyyah\add* to have a large¦227987 room that had previously been used to store offerings: the frankincense¦227995, the utensils, and \add ≈donated\add* grain, wine, and oil, (the percentage commanded¦228001 \add to be given to\add* the Levites¦228002, the singers¦228003, and the gatekeepers¦228004), and the offerings for the priests¦228006.
\v 6 \add ≈During all that period,\add* I hadn't been in Yerushalem¦228013 because I'd returned to the Babylonian king in the 32nd year of Artahshashta's reign \add (Artaxerxes¦228018)\add*. \add ≈However, after a while\add* I requested¦228028 leave¦228028 \add again\add* from the king

\v 8 \add ≈It made me very upset\add* and¦228051 I threw¦228051 everything of Toviyyah's out of the room.
\v 9 Then¦228065 I \add ≈ordered¦228065 the storerooms to be purified\add* \add by the priests\add* \add ≈before\add* I returned¦228068 the \add ≈temple utensils¦228070\add* to the room, along with the grain¦228075 offerings¦228075 and the incense.

\v 10 I¦228090 \add ≈found¦228079 out\add* that the Levites¦228083 and the singers¦228091 weren't being given¦228085 their percentage, \add so they'd left their duties and\add* returned to \add cultivate\add* their own fields¦228089.\x + \xo 13:10: \xt Deu 12:19.\x*
\v 11 I \add ≈made a complaint to\add* the officials¦228098 asking why the \add ≈operation of the temple had been neglected¦228101\add*, and then I \add ≈rounded up\add* \add @the Levites and the singers\add* and \add ≈sent them back to their¦228110 duties\add*.
\v 12 \add ≈After that,\add* \add the people of\add* Yehudah¦228114 \add ≈started bringing\add* a tenth of \add &their\add* grain¦228117 and wine and oil to the storerooms¦228120.\x + \xo 13:12: \xt Mal 3:10.\x*

\v 15 In those¦228170 days¦228169 I saw \add people\add* in Yehudah¦228172 \add working\add* on the rest day—treading wine, bringing in grain¦228181, and loading¦228182 donkeys¦228185, yes, even bringing wine, grapes¦228189, figs, and all kinds of loads into Yerushalem¦228195 on the rest day. I \add ≈complained to them when they were selling¦228200 the goods\add*.\x + \xo 13:15: \xt Exo 20:8-10; Deu 5:12-14; Jer 17:21-22.\x*
\v 16 \add ≈Also, people¦228213 from Tsor\add* \add (Tyre)\add* were bringing¦228206 in fish¦228207 and all kinds of merchandise¦228210 and were selling it on the rest day to the \add ≈Israelis\add*, even in Yerushalem¦228215.
\v 17 I¦228220 rebuked¦228217 the Yehudah \add ≈business leaders\add*, asking them, “What's this evil thing¦228225 that you're all doing¦228230—profaning¦228231 the rest day \add by treating it like a regular day\add*?
\v 18 \add ≈Wasn't that what your¦228240 ancestors¦228240 did—the very reason\add* our God brought¦228241 all this evil on us and on this city¦228250? \add ≈Now\add* you're all \add ≈making God angry with\add* Israel¦228257 \add again\add* by profaning¦228258 the rest day.”
\p
\v 19 \add ≈So after that, when it started to get dark on Friday evenings, I ordered¦228274 that the city gates be closed, and not to be opened¦228277 until¦228278 after the rest day\add*. I \add ≈also stationed¦228282 some of my young men to stand at the gates to ensure that no load could enter on the rest day\add*.
\v 20 \add ≈Some¦228300 traders and merchants¦228294 selling various goods camped outside¦228299 the city walls once or twice¦228302\add*,
\v 21 \add ≈but I warned¦228304\add* them, “Why are you \add ≈camping there outside\add* the wall? If you \add ≈do it again¦228315, I'll have you all removed\add*.” \add ≈After that\add*, they \add ≈no longer came¦228325 on the rest days\add*.
\v 22 Then I told the Levites¦228330 that they¦228332 should purify¦228333 themselves¦228333 and then come¦228334 to the gates¦228336 to \add ≈monitor them on the rest day¦228340\add*.

\v 23 \add ≈During that time\add*, I also saw¦228359 Jews who'd \add ≈married¦228363\add* women¦228364 \add ≈from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moav\add*,
\v 24 and half of their¦228373 children¦228373 spoke \add ≈a foreign language¦228381 from those other people groups\add* and \add ≈couldn't speak¦228375 Hebrew\add*.
\v 25 \add ≈So¦228385\add* I scolded \add @those men\add* and cursed¦228387 them and hit \add some of\add* them and pulled¦228391 out their hair. Then¦228385 I \add ≈forced them to promise in front on God¦228393 that they wouldn't allow their daughters to marry foreign men, or their sons to take foreign wives\add*.
\v 26 \add I explained,\add* “Didn't Israel's¦228414 \add own\add* King Shelomoh sin concerning that same matter? Among \add ≈all the countries¦228415\add* \add in the world\add*, there wasn't any other king like, and he was loved¦228422 by his God¦228423 who'd placed him \add there\add* as king over all Israel. \add But even then,\add* the foreign¦228438 women¦228437 caused¦228436 him to sin.

\v 28 \add ≈Also\add* one of Yoyada's sons¦228455 (grandson of the high¦228461 priest¦228460 Elyashiv) was a son-in-law of Sanvallat the Horonite, \add ≈so I banished him¦228465 from my sight\add*.\x + \xo 13:28: \xt Neh 4:1.\x*
