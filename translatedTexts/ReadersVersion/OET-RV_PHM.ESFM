\mt2 Paul's letter to
\mt1 Philemon
\is1 Introduction
\ip Philemon was known to be a follower of Yeshua and he was a member of a group of believers in the city of Colossae. He was the owner of a slave named Onesimus. Onesimus had fled from his master and eventually met Paul the missionary in prison in Rome. It was there that Onesimus became a believer in Yeshua because of Paul's sharing of the good message. Here in \bk Paul's letter to Philemon\bk*, Paul requests that the good relationship be restored between Philemon and his slave, Onesimus. Because Paul sent Onesimus back to Philemon, he wanted Philemon to take his slave back in, not just because he'd forgiven his slave, but also because his slave was now a fellow believer and hence his brother.

\v 4 \add Philemon,\add* I'm always¦141598 thanking¦141594 my \nd God¦141596\nd* and mentioning¦141599 you¦141600 in my prayers¦141604
\v 5 \add after\add* hearing¦141606 your faith¦141612 and about your love¦141609 for the \nd master¦141618 Yeshua¦141619\nd* and for all the believers.
\v 6 \add I pray that\add* the fellowship¦141627 of your¦141630 faith¦141629 may become¦141632 active¦141631 in the knowledge¦141634 of every¦141635 good¦141636 thing in us toward¦141641 \add the\add* \nd messiah¦141642\nd*. [WHAT DOES THAT MEAN???]
\v 7 Because¦141646 I was very happy and encouraged by your¦141655 love¦141654, because¦141656 the hearts¦141658 of the believers have been refreshed¦141661 by you, brother¦141664.

\p
\v 8 Therefore¦141665, with the help of the \nd messiah¦141668\nd*, I would be brave enough to tell you what you need to do,
\v 9 but because¦141675 of love¦141678 as Paul¦141684, an older¦141685 man¦141685 and¦141688 now also a prisoner¦141690 for \nd Yeshua¦141692\nd* the \nd messiah¦141691\nd*, I'm just going to encourage you¦141680 to do it.
\v 10 \x + \xo 10: \xt Col 4:9.\x*So I'm going to encourage you¦141695 concerning Onesimus¦141707 who became my \add spiritual\add* ‘son’ since I've been imprisoned.
\v 11 Before he was useless¦141711 to you, but now he's useful¦141718 to both of us.
\p
\v 12 I sent¦141720 him¦141724 to you¦141722 (even though in my heart¦141729
\v 13 I wanted to keep him \add here\add*) so that he might be serving¦141742 me \add here due to\add* the bonds¦141746 of the good¦141748 message¦141748
\v 14 but I didn't¦141758 want to do anything without \add hearing\add* your¦141764 opinion¦141753, so that you're not doing good¦141763 because you have to, but rather because you want to.
\p
\v 15 It was possibly¦141769 because¦141771 of that that he¦141773 was separated¦141773 \add from you\add* for a while, so that on the eternal¦141777 \add scale\add* you could fully¦141779 accept him¦141778,
\v 16 no longer¦141780 as a slave but better than a slave—a dear brother to me most of you but preferably \add also\add* to you—a brother in the body¦141796 and in the \nd master¦141799\nd*.
\p
\v 17 Therefore¦141801, if you consider me as your partner¦141805, accept him¦141807 like you'd accept me,
\v 18 but¦141812 if he¦141814 did anything wrong¦141814 to you or owes you anything, charge it to me.
\v 19 \sig I, Paul¦141824, wrote¦141825 this bit in my own handwriting. I will pay back anything \+add he owes you\+add*, then I won't¦141832 need to be reminding you that you \+add pretty much\+add* owe yourself¦141837 to me.\sig*
\v 20 \sig Yes, brother¦141843, \+add with both of us being\+add* in the \+nd master¦141848\+nd*, I might¦141846 \+add hopefully\+add* benefit¦141846 from you¦141845—refresh¦141849 my¦141850 heart¦141852 in \+add the\+add* \+nd messiah¦141854\+nd*.\sig*
\p
\v 21 \sig I wrote¦141860 to you because I was sure that you'd obey \+add my request\+add*, in fact knowing¦141862 that you'd do even more than what I ask.\sig*
\s1 Paul's final greetings
\p
\v 22 \sig \+add Go ahead and\+add* prepare¦141873 somewhere for me to stay because¦141877 I'm hoping¦141876 that I'll be able to visit \+add thanks\+add* to you all praying \+add for me\+add*.\sig*
