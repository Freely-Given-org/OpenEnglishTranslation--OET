\mt2 Paul's letter to
\mt1 Philemon
\is1 Introduction
\ip Philemon was known to be a follower of Yeshua and he was a member of a group of believers in the city of Colossae. He was the owner of a slave named Onesimus. Onesimus had fled from his master and eventually met Paul the missionary in prison in Rome. It was there that Onesimus became a believer in Yeshua because of Paul's sharing of the good message. Here in \bk Paul's letter to Philemon\bk*, Paul requests that the good relationship be restored between Philemon and his slave, Onesimus. Because Paul sent Onesimus back to Philemon, he wanted Philemon to take his slave back in, not just because he'd forgiven his slave, but also because his slave was now a fellow believer and hence his brother.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul, a prisoner¦140603 of \nd messiah¦140604 Yeshua\nd*, and our brother¦140609 Timothy¦140607. \add I'm writing\add* to our dear co-worker Philemon¦140610,
\v 2 \x + \xo 2: \xt Col 4:17.\x*as well as \add our\add* sister¦140619 Apphia¦140617 and our fellow-soldier Archippus¦140622, and to the assembly¦140631 \add that meets\add* in your¦140630 home.
\v 3 \add May you¦140633 all experience\add* grace¦140632 and peace¦140635 from our¦140639 father¦140638 \nd God¦140637\nd* and from the \nd master¦140641 Yeshua\nd* \add the\add* \nd messiah¦140643\nd*.

\v 4 \add Philemon,\add* I'm always¦140648 thanking¦140644 my \nd God¦140646\nd* and mentioning¦140649 you¦140650 in my prayers¦140654
\v 5 \add after\add* hearing¦140656 your faith¦140662 and about your love¦140659 for the \nd master¦140668 Yeshua¦140669\nd* and for all the believers.
\v 6 \add I pray that¦140687\add* the fellowship¦140677 of your¦140680 faith¦140679 may become¦140682 active¦140681 in the knowledge¦140684 of every¦140685 good¦140686 thing in us toward¦140691 \add the\add* \nd messiah¦140692\nd*, [WHAT DOES THAT MEAN???]
\v 7 because I was very happy and encouraged by your¦140705 love¦140704, because the hearts¦140708 of the believers have been refreshed¦140711 by you, brother¦140714.

\p
\v 8 Therefore¦140715, with the help of the \nd messiah¦140718\nd*, I would be brave enough to tell you what you need to do,
\v 9 but because¦140725 of love¦140728 as Paul¦140734, an older¦140735 man¦140735 and¦140738 now also a prisoner¦140740 for \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦140741\nd*, I'm just going to encourage you¦140730 to do it.
\v 10 \x + \xo 10: \xt Col 4:9.\x*So I'm going to encourage you¦140745 concerning Onesimus¦140757 who became my \add spiritual\add* ‘son’ since I've been imprisoned.
\v 11 Before, he was useless¦140761 to you, but now he's useful¦140768 to both of us.
\p
\v 12 I sent¦140770 him¦140774 to you¦140772 (even though in my heart¦140779
\v 13 I wanted to keep him \add here\add*) so that he might be serving¦140791 me \add here due to\add* the bonds¦140795 of the good¦140797 message¦140797,
\v 14 but I didn't¦140807 want to do anything without \add hearing\add* your¦140813 opinion¦140802, so that you're not doing good¦140812 because you have to, but rather because you want to.
\p
\v 15 It was possibly¦140818 because¦140820 of that that he¦140822 was separated¦140822 \add from you\add* for a while, so that on the eternal¦140826 \add scale\add* you could fully¦140828 accept him¦140827,
\v 16 no longer¦140829 as a slave, but better than a slave—a dear brother to me most of all, but preferably \add also\add* to you—a brother in the body¦140845 and in \nd Yahweh¦140848\nd*.
\p
\v 17 Therefore¦140850, if you consider me as your partner¦140853, accept him¦140855 like you'd accept me,
\v 18 but¦140859 if he¦140861 did anything wrong¦140861 to you or owes you anything, charge it to me.
\v 19 \sig I, Paul¦140870, wrote¦140871 this bit in my own handwriting. I will pay back anything \+add he owes you\+add*, then I won't¦140878 need to be reminding you that you \+add pretty much\+add* owe yourself¦140883 to me.\sig*
\v 20 \sig Yes, brother¦140889, \+add with both of us being\+add* in \+nd Yahweh¦140894\+nd*, I might¦140892 \+add hopefully\+add* benefit¦140892 from you¦140891—refresh¦140895 my¦140896 heart¦140898 in \+add the\+add* \+nd messiah¦140900\+nd*.\sig*
\p
\v 21 \sig I wrote¦140906 to you because I was sure that you'd obey \+add my request\+add*, in fact knowing¦140908 that you'd do even more than what I ask.\sig*
\s1 Paul's final greetings
\p
\v 22 \sig \+add Go ahead and¦140917\+add* prepare¦140919 somewhere for me to stay, because¦140923 I'm hoping¦140922 that I'll be able to visit, \+add thanks\+add* to you all praying \+add for me\+add*.\sig*
