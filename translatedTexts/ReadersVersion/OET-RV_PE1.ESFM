\mt2 The first letter from
\mt1 Simon ‘the Rock’ (Peter)
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk The first letter from Simon ‘Peter’\bk* was written to believers scattered throughout Asia Minor (also called Anatolia, now part of modern Turkey). Peter wrote to encourage the believers that it's necessary for them to be strong even in the middle of much persecution that comes because of their faith in the messiah. He reminds them about their salvation, the death of Yeshua the messiah, and of his coming back to life. Because Peter told them that there must always remember their hope in heaven, then they can persevere even through all the difficulties here on earth. He also reminds them that if their faith holds strong through their suffering of difficulties and persecutions, they will receive a gift at “The time when Yeshua the messiah is revealed.” (1:7,13)
\ip He also warns them that it's necessary to watch their behaviour as followers of the messiah and it's necessary that they follow the guidance of their elders.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Peter¦149434, a missionary for \nd Yeshua¦149436\nd* the \nd messiah¦149437\nd*.
\p \add It's written\add* to those who've been chosen \add by God\add* and dispersed¦149441 \add by persecution\add* throughout \add the provinces of\add* Pontus¦149442, Galatia¦149443, Cappadocia¦149444, Asia¦149445 \add Minor\add* and Bithynia¦149447.

\rem /s1 Praise to God for a Living Hope; The Hope of Eternal Life; Peter gives thanks
\p May \add God give\add* you¦149463 all grace¦149462 and multiplied¦149466 peace¦149465.
\s1 The future hope of life without ending
\p
\v 3 May \nd God¦149469\nd*, the father¦149471 of our¦149474 \nd master¦149473\nd* Yeshua the messiah be blessed. He's the one who, because of his¦149481 incredible mercy¦149482, births us into living¦149489 hope through¦149490 the death and¦149470 coming back to life of Yeshua the messiah.
\v 4 \add Now we have\add* an inheritance¦149497 that can't be destroyed or ruined and never diminishes. It's kept¦149505 in the heavens¦149508 for you¦149512 all
\v 5 who are guarded¦149517 through¦149518 faith¦149519 by God's power¦149515, because¦149520 salvation¦149521 is ready¦149523 to be revealed¦149524 in the final age.
\p
\v 6 \add This salvation\add* brings some happiness now, although offset by the sorrow¦149537 of various¦149541 trials¦149543 \add that you¦149530 all go through\add*
\v 7 in order¦149544 that your faith will be purified by fire, like gold but \add even\add* more precious¦149552 because gold perishes¦149557. Then your faith will lead to praise¦149565 and glory¦149568 and honour¦149572 when \nd Yeshua¦149575\nd* the \nd messiah¦149576\nd* is revealed,
\v 8 the one you all love although you've never seen¦149580 him. Yet you all believe¦149588 and because of that you are more happy than you all can even show AND HAVING BEEN GLORIFIED,
\v 9 you'll receive¦149596 the result of your faith¦149600 which is the salvation¦149602 of your souls¦149603.
\rem /s1 The calling of a Christian
\p
\v 10 The prophets¦149610 wanted that salvation¦149606 and¦149608 searched¦149609 for it, even while speaking about the grace¦149616 which you¦149615 all would experience.
\v 11 They tried to discover which person or what time¦149623 that the messiah's \nd spirit¦149628\nd* within them was telling them, having previously¦149630 testified¦149630 that the messiah would suffer¦149635 but afterwards¦149638 would be GLORIOUS.
\v 12 It was shown to them that they weren't just serving themselves¦149646 but were serving you as they declared¦149654 all the same things that have been preached¦149658 to you all by the holy \nd spirit¦149662\nd* who was sent from heaven. Even \add God's\add* messengers¦149670 in heaven wanted to know more about those things.

\v 14 As people who want to obey, don't¦149694 conform¦149695 to your earlier¦149697 desires¦149702 that came from your ignorance¦149700,
\v 15 but¦149703 just as \add God\add* who called¦149706 you¦149707 is holy, your yourselves¦149710 need to be holy in all your conduct¦149714,

\p
\v 17 As since you call on the father¦149731 who impartially¦149735 judges each person according¦149738 to their actions, then continue to obey him even as you all live in foreign lands,
\v 18 knowing¦149752 that when you all were in slavery due to your poor conduct¦149766 that you inherited¦149767 from your ancestors, you weren't bought out of that by payment of perishable¦149755 things like silver¦149757 or gold¦149760,
\v 19 but¦149769 by the precious¦149771 blood¦149772 of the \nd messiah¦149778\nd*—the unblemished¦149775 and¦149776 spotless¦149777 lamb.
\v 20 He had been foreknown¦149780 before¦149783 the creation of the world¦149785, yet he was only revealed¦149786 recently for the sake of all of you
\v 21 who believe¦149801 in God through him. God was the one who raised¦149806 him from the dead¦149810 and honoured him, so that your¦149818 faith¦149817 and hope would be in God.
\p
\v 22 Since your souls¦149826 have been purified¦149828 by obeying the truth¦149833, \add now\add* you should love each other from your hearts¦149841 and without hypocrisy.
\v 23 You've been born again¦149846, not by some physical thing that will perish¦149851, but¦149852 of indestructible¦149853 material—God's message¦149855 that's alive and¦149858 lives on

\s1 The suffering of believers

\v 12 Dear friends, don't¦151046 be surprised¦151047 as the fiery¦151052 trials that you all will have to face as a test, as though¦151057 it's something unusual that's happening¦151060 to you,
\v 13 but rather as you all share in the sufferings¦151067 of the \nd messiah¦151066\nd*, stay positive so that you will all be happy as you're also glad to see his¦151076 honour revealed.
\v 14 You all \add will be\add* blessed¦151084 if you are derided¦151080 in the name¦151082 of the \nd messiah¦151083\nd* because¦151085 God's spirit rests on you all—the spirit that honours \add him\add*.
\v 15 None of you should¦151115 suffer¦151115 \add persecution\add* because¦151112 you're a murderer¦151117 or a thief¦151121 or a troublemaker or nosey-parker,
\v 16 but if you \add suffer\add* for being¦151137 a follower¦151135 of the messiah¦151135, then there's no need to feel ashamed¦151137 but \add instead\add* be praising \nd God¦151141\nd* in that name¦151144.
\p
\v 17 It's time¦151149 to begin judgement and to begin with God's people, and if we're judged first¦151161, what will the outcome¦151167 be for those who refuse to believe in God's good¦151174 message¦151174?
\v 18 \x + \xo 4:18: \xt Prv 11:31 (LXX).\x*Yes,
\q1 ‘if it's difficult¦151180 for godly people to be saved¦151181,
\q2 what will it be like for the ungodly¦151184 and¦151185 for sinners¦151187.’
\m
\v 19 So for anyone who's suffering¦151195 according¦151196 to God's will, let them entrust¦151204 the well-being of their¦151208 souls¦151206 to the faithful¦151202 creator¦151203.

\v 1 Because of that I am encouraging your elders as a fellow¦151219 elder and witness¦151221 of the sufferings¦151226 of the \nd messiah¦151225\nd* and also a partner¦151235 in the GLORY that's going¦151230 to be revealed¦151231:
\v 2 \x + \xo 5:2: \xt Yhn 21:15-17.\x*Carefully shepherd¦151236 God's people that you¦151239 care for, not out of compulsion¦151245 but willingly¦151247, listening to God, not greedily¦151252 but enthusiastically,
\v 3 not exercising¦151257 dominance over them, but¦151260 being examples¦151261 for them.
\v 4 Then¦151265 when the chief¦151268 shepherd¦151268 \add returns\add*, you¦151269 all will receive¦151269 the unfading¦151271 crown¦151274 of honour.
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 5:5: \xt Prv 3:34 (LXX).\x*Similarly¦151275, you younger¦151277 ones, take the advice of your elders¦151280, and all of you, show humility¦151287 to each other because¦151289 ‘\nd God¦151291\nd* opposes¦151293 those who're proud¦151292, but¦151295 displays grace¦151297 to those who're humble¦151294.’
\v 6 \x + \xo 5:6: \xt Mat 23:12; Luk 14:11; 18:14.\x*So¦151299 humble¦151298 yourselves under¦151300 God's might hand¦151303 so that he might honour you at the \add right\add* time¦151311.
\v 7 Give all your¦151316 concerns to him because¦151322 he cares about¦151325 you all.
\p
\v 8 Stay alert and keep watch¦151329. Your¦151333 opponent¦151332, the devil¦151335, walks around like a roaring¦151339 lion¦151338, wanting to swallow¦151343 \add you¦151333 all\add* up
\v 9 \add but remain\add* firmly in the faith¦151350 and resist¦151346 him, knowing¦151351 that fellow believers \add all around\add* the world¦151361 experiencing similar sufferings¦151356 are doing the same¦151354.
\v 10 Then¦151368 \nd God¦151369\nd*, \add the source\add* of all grace¦151371 and the one who called¦151373 you to his¦151379 eternal¦151378 GLORY in the \nd messiah¦151383\nd* will prepare¦151388 you all as you suffer¦151386 a little¦151385, and will then strengthen you as you're established.
\v 11 May his ruling be powerful throughout all the ages. May it¦151409 be so¦151409.
