\mt2 The second letter
\mt2 that we have written by
\mt1 Yohan (John)
\is1 Introduction
\ip This the second letter that we have by Yohan one of the earliest followers of Yeshua. He sent this letter to a chosen woman and her children—presumably meaning ‘chosen by God’. Some think this might be referring to a group of believers (in which case, the ‘chosen sister’ of the closing sentence might also be a congregation). This short letter reminds the recipients that it's necessary to keep following the truth of Yeshua's original teaching and to love each other. It also warns about those who teach that Yeshua was not the messiah (or was not God).

\v 1 \add This letter is from Yohan\add* the elder¦154185 to the chosen¦154186 lady and her¦154191 children¦154190 who I genuinely love (as do all the other believers)
\v 2 because¦154209 of the truth¦154211 that¦154212 lives in us and¦154217 will be with us forever.
\p
\v 3 We will have grace¦154228, mercy¦154229, and peace¦154230 in truth¦154246 and love from \nd God¦154233\nd* the father and from his son \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦154239\nd*.

\p
\v 4 I was so happy that I found¦154252 some of your¦154257 children¦154256 living out the truth¦154260 as per the command¦154262 that the father¦154268 gave us.
\v 5 \x + \xo 5: \xt Yhn 13:34; 15:12,17.\x*So¦154269 now I'm requesting you, lady, (not making some new command¦154276, but one that we've had since the beginning¦154287) that we all need to love each other
\v 6 where the definition of love is obeying God's commands¦154300. This is the command¦154308 about walking in love that you all heard¦154314 from the beginning¦154316
\v 7 because many false preachers have entered the world¦154329 who don't¦154331 believe that \nd Yeshua\nd* is the messiah who came¦154325 as a human. Any person like that is a deceiver¦154341 and¦154342 against the messiah.
\p
\v 8 So make sure that you all don't¦154349 lose what you've worked for, but rather go on to receive a full reward¦154357.
\p
\v 9 \nd Anyone¦154375\nd* who doesn't stay with the \nd messiah's¦154375\nd* teaching or adds more to it doesn't have \nd God¦154376\nd*—it's the person who continues in the his teaching that¦154362 has both the father¦154390 and the son with them.
\v 10 If anyone¦154397 comes to you¦154400 all and doesn't bring¦154408 this same message, don't accept that person into your house¦154413, and don't tell them that it's good
\v 11 because¦154421 anyone who encourages those people is participating in the evil¦154430 that they're spreading.

\p
\v 12 I've got many things that I wanted to write to you about, but paper¦154440 and ink¦154442 aren't¦154437 working for me so I'll try to come and then we can talk directly because I want you all to experience genuine happiness.
\p
\v 13 Your¦154472 sister's¦154471 children¦154469 (and she's also a chosen¦154474 one) send their greetings¦154466 also.
