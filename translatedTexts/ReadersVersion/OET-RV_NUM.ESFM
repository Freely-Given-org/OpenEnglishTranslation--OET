\v 1 In April of the year¦61073 after¦61075 the Israeli people \add ≈escaped from\add* Egypt¦61077 \add (Heb.

\v 2 “\add ≈Count all the men who're Yisrael's descendants by their clans¦61090 and families, being sure to list all their names¦61094\add*.
\v 3 \add Only include those\add* who're twenty¦61101 or older and able \add to be recruited\add* as soldiers. You and Aharon must enrol¦61109 them into military¦61111 divisions¦61111.
\v 4 \add ≈The leader of each tribe¦61119 will accompany\add* you.

\v 5 These are the names¦61128 of the men¦61129 who will \add ≈assist\add* you:

\v 14 Elyasaf (Reuel's¦61198 son) from Gad,
\li1
\v 15 Ahira¦61201 (Enan's¦61204 son) from Naftali.
\v 16 They¦61215 were the leaders of their tribes¦61211—chosen out of their communities¦61209, and leaders of \add units of\add* one thousand \add soldiers\add*.
\p
\v 17 Mosheh¦61219 and¦61220 Aharon¦61220 took¦61218 those men¦61222 whose names had been \add ≈given\add*
\v 18 and¦61228 they assembled the entire¦61229 community¦61231 that April. \add ≈For each tribe,\add* they recorded their¦61248 ancestry¦61241 by clan, counting the names¦61243 of those men who were twenty¦61245 or over,
\v 19 just as Yahweh¦61252 had commanded¦61251 Mosheh¦61255. \add ≈So\add* he¦61251 counted¦61256 them \add there\add* in the Sinai¦61258 wilderness¦61257,
\v 20-21 individually counting those \add in each tribe below\add* by their¦61273 clan, and only including males who were twenty¦61278 or older and able to fight in battle:
\li1 46,500 men from the tribe of Rueven,
\li1
\v 22-23 59,300 men from the tribe of Shim'on \add (Simeon¦61296)\add*,

\v 42-43 53,400 men from the tribe of Naftali¦61562.
\p
\v 44 Those were the ones that Mosheh¦61591 and Aharon and the twelve Israeli¦61593 leaders¦61593 (one from each tribe) listed.
\v 45 They were all the \add ≈Israelis¦61609\add* who were counted according to their¦61614 \add ≈ancestry¦61614\add*, being men who were twenty¦61616 or older, and¦61618 \add ≈capable of going off to battle\add*—
\v 46 603,550 of them in total.
\v 47 \add ≈However,\add* the Levites \add ≈weren't listed along with the other tribes¦61640\add*
\v 48 \add ≈because\add* Yahweh¦61648 had told Mosheh¦61651,
\v 49 “Don't list the Levites \add ≈or count them with the other Israelis¦61667\add*.
\v 50 \add ≈Instead,\add* appoint¦61671 \add *them\add* to manage the tent \add ≈where the copy of the agreement is kept\add*, along with all its¦61700 equipment. They must serve inside it as \add required\add*, and¦61670 they should \add ≈set their tents up around¦61701 it\add*.
\v 51 \add ≈When¦61714 it's time to leave that place\add*, the Levites¦61709 must take¦61707 \add @the tent\add* down and¦61705 when camp \add ≈is set up\add*, they must erect it \add again\add*, \add ≈but\add* any stranger who approaches it must be \add ≈executed\add*.
\v 52 \add When¦61721\add* the \add other\add* \add ≈Israelis¦61720\add* set up camp, each man¦61726 must set up with his army division¦61730 by their¦61730 banner,
\v 53 \add ≈but\add* the Levites¦61747 will camp there around¦61734 the \add ≈sacred tent\add* and¦61732 look after it¦61739. \add ≈That way,\add* the Israeli¦61744 community won't¦61737 make \add Yahweh\add* angry.
\v 54 \add ≈So¦61754 the Israelis¦61756 did everything\add* that Yahweh¦61760 had instructed¦61759 Mosheh¦61763.

\v 24 The total number in the divisions¦62044 in the Efrayim camp is 108,100, and \add ≈when travelling\add*, \add ≈they'll all go third¦62045\add*.

\p
\v 5 Then Yahweh¦62249 told Mosheh¦62252,
\v 6 “Summon the Levites to come and stand in front¦62262 of Aharon the priest¦62264, so they can assist¦62265 him.
\v 7 They must perform¦62268 duties¦62271 for him¦62271 and for the entire¦62275 community¦62277 at and around the \add ≈sacred¦62285 tent¦62285\add*,

\v 9 You must assign the Levites¦62309 to Aharon—out of all the \add ≈Israelis¦62317\add* it's them who are assigned \add to serve the priests\add*.
\v 10 Appoint Aharon and his sons¦62325 as priests and to preserve the priesthood. Any other person \add ≈who tries to act as a priest\add* \add ≈must be executed\add*.”
\p
\v 11 Then Yahweh¦62337 told Mosheh¦62340,
\v 12 “Out of all the \add ≈Israelis¦62350\add*, I've taken¦62345 the Levites instead of the \add ≈oldest son from every¦62353 family\add*. The Levites \add ≈will be the ransom for those sons¦62358\add*, and¦62360 so they¦62360 belong to me,

\p
\v 14 Then in the Sinai¦62398 wilderness¦62397, Yahweh¦62393 told Mosheh¦62396,
\v 15 “List all the male¦62411 Levites that are at least one month¦62414 old. Count them by their families and clans¦62408.”
\v 16 \add ≈So¦62418\add* Mosheh¦62420 listed them exactly as Yahweh¦62424 had commanded¦62426 him to,
\v 17 and these¦62430 were Levi's¦62433 sons¦62431: Gershon¦62435, Kohat¦62436, and Merari¦62437.
\v 18 Gershon's¦62443 sons¦62441 were: Livni¦62445 and¦62446 Shimei¦62446.
\v 19 Kohat's¦62449 sons¦62448 were: Amaran, Yitshar, Hevron, and¦62448 Uzziyel.
\v 20 Merari's¦62457 sons¦62456 were Mahli¦62459 and¦62456 Mushi¦62460.
\m Those were the families of the Levites¦62464 by their clans.
\p
\v 21 Gershon's descendants were the Livnites and¦62471 the Shimites, so they¦62474 made up the Gershonites.
\v 22 They had 7,500 males that were at least a month¦62485 old.
\v 23 The Gershonite clans¦62493 were to camp on the western side of the \add ≈sacred¦62496 tent¦62496\add*,
\v 24 and¦62500 \add *their\add* leader¦62500 was Lael's¦62508 son Elyasaf.
\v 25 Gershon's¦62513 descendants¦62511 were responsible¦62510 for the \add ≈sacred¦62516 tent¦62516\add*, including its¦62518 covering¦62518 and¦62510 the entrance¦62520 curtain,

\p
\v 27 Kohat's descendants were the Amramites, the Yitsharites, the Hevronites, and¦62544 the Uzziyelites, so they¦62554 made up the Kohatites.
\v 28 They had 8,600 males that were at least a month¦62564 old. They were in charge of the running of the \add ≈sacred¦62572 tent¦62572\add*.
\v 29 The Kohatite clans¦62574 were to camp of the southern¦62582 side of the \add ≈sacred¦62581 tent¦62581\add*,
\v 30 and¦62584 \add *their\add* leader¦62584 was Uzziyel's son Elitsafan.
\v 31 They were in charge of the box, the table¦62598 and the lampstand¦62599, the altars¦62600 and all the utensils used for ministry, the \add inside\add* curtain and its gear.
\p
\v 32 The man who organised the Levites¦62612 was Aharon's son, Eleazar¦62613 the priest¦62617. He had oversight¦62618 over all those who were responsible for the \add ≈sacred¦62621 tent¦62621\add*.
\p
\v 33 Merari's descendants were the Mahlites and¦62626 the Mushites, so they¦62629 made up the Merarites.
\v 34 They had 6,200 males that were at least a month¦62640 old,
\v 35 and¦62646 their leader¦62646 was Avihayil's son Tsuriel¦62652. They were to camp on the northern¦62660 side of the \add ≈sacred¦62658 tent¦62658\add*.
\v 36 \add *They\add* were in charge of all the frames¦62666 for the \add ≈sacred¦62667 tent¦62667\add*, its crossbars, posts, bases¦62670, all its containers and¦62662 equipment¦62673,
\v 37 as well as the pillars¦62677 \add used to make\add* the courtyard¦62678 with their bases¦62680, pegs, and¦62677 ropes¦62682.
\p
\v 38 Mosheh¦62694 and Aharon and his sons¦62697 \add ≈set up their tents\add* \add ≈in front of\add* \add the entrance on\add* the eastern¦62687 side of the \add ≈sacred¦62700 tent\add*.

\v 39 Mosheh¦62714 and Aharon listed 22,000 Levite¦62711 males that were at least a month¦62727 old, listing them by their¦62721 clans¦62721 as \add ≈per Yahweh's instructions\add*.

\p
\v 40 Then Yahweh¦62735 told Mosheh¦62738, “List all the \add other\add* male¦62743 \add ≈Israeli¦62745\add* that are at least one month¦62748 old and \add ≈count them\add*.
\v 41 The Levites¦62758 are for me, Yahweh¦62761, in the place of the firstborn males from every \add ≈Israeli¦62766\add* family, and¦62755 their animals are in place of the \add ≈Israelis'\add* firstborn male animals.”
\v 42 \add ≈So¦62779\add* Mosheh¦62780 listed the firstborn¦62789 Israelis¦62790 exactly as Yahweh¦62783 had commanded¦62782 him to.
\v 43 and¦62793 the total number of firstborn¦62796 males a month¦62802 old or more whose names¦62799 were listed came to 22,273.
\p
\v 44 Then Yahweh¦62814 spoke¦62813 to Mosheh¦62817,
\v 45 “Take the Levites instead of every¦62825 firstborn¦62827 male Israeli¦62828, and the Levites' animals instead of their¦62835 animals, and the Levites will be mine—I am Yahweh¦62841.
\v 46 To redeem the 273 firstborn¦62852 Israelis¦62854 who outnumber¦62848 the Levites¦62851,
\v 47 collect¦62856 five silver coins for each one of them. (Use the same silver coins weighing eleven grams, that the priests use in the \add ≈sacred¦62862 tent¦62862\add*.)
\v 48 Give that \add ≈money¦62869\add* to Aharon and¦62871 his sons¦62871 as payment of the ransom¦62872 for those excess¦62873 273 males.”
\v 49 \add ≈So¦62876\add* Mosheh¦62877 collected that ransom money¦62879 to cover the ransom of the excess¦62882 \add not covered by the number of\add* Levites¦62885.
\v 50 He¦62890 collected 1,365 silver coins from the firstborn¦62888 Israeli¦62889 males (using the standard weight of silver from the sanctuary¦62901)
\v 51 and gave¦62903 \add *it\add* to Aharon and his sons¦62910 just as Yahweh¦62914 had commanded¦62916.

\v 3 \add ≈who are from twenty-five up to fifty¦62953 years old\add* and who goes into the \add ≈sacred tent\add* to minister.
\p
\v 4 This is what the Kohatites are responsible for concerning the \add ≈sacred¦62971 tent including the inner room\add*:
\v 5 When \add ≈it's time to break camp\add*, Aharon and his sons¦62976 must enter and take¦62979 down the curtain¦62981 that veils it, and then¦62974 use that to cover¦62983 the box \add ≈containing the agreement\add*.
\v 6 Then¦62990 they must cover it with \add ?≈fine\add* leather, followed by a blue cloth, and¦62990 then¦62990 put its¦63002 \add carrying\add* poles¦63002 \add through the rings\add*.
\p
\v 7 They must spread¦63008 a blue cloth over the \add ≈sacred bread table¦63006\add*, then¦63004 place the dishes¦63018, pans, bowls¦63021, and¦63004 jugs for the drink-offerings on top of that, along with the \add ≈sacred\add* bread.
\v 8 Then¦63030 they must spread¦63030 a scarlet cloth over all that, and cover¦63035 that again with \add ?≈fine\add* leather, and then¦63030 put its¦63043 poles¦63043 \add through the rings\add*.
\p
\v 9 They must spread a blue cloth over the lampstand with its \add oil\add* lamps, its tongs and trays¦63062, and the oil containers that¦63068 are used for it.
\v 10 Then¦63074 they must wrap the lampstand and all its equipment in \add ?≈fine\add* leather, and place it \add all\add* on its carrying¦63089 frame¦63089.
\p
\v 11 Then¦63091 the must spread¦63095 a blue cloth over the gold¦63094 \add incense\add* altar¦63093, and cover¦63098 that again with \add ?≈fine\add* leather, and then¦63091 put its¦63106 poles¦63106 \add through the rings\add*.
\v 12 Then¦63108 they must get all the \add other\add* utensils that they use in the \add ≈sacred¦63119 tent¦63119\add*, and cover¦63125 that again with \add ?≈fine\add* leather, and place it \add all\add* on its carrying¦63133 frame¦63133.
\v 13 They need to remove the ashes¦63135 from the \add bronze\add* altar¦63138 and¦63139 spread¦63139 a purple¦63142 cloth¦63142 over it,
\v 14 and put all the utensils¦63150 they use on top of it: the trays, meat forks¦63160, shovel¦63163 and basins¦63166 for the altar¦63169. Then¦63144 they must cover¦63172 it with \add ?≈fine\add* leather, and then¦63144 put its poles¦63176 \add through the rings\add*.
\v 15 Aharon and his sons¦63181 must finish¦63178 covering¦63182 the \add ≈sacred tent\add* and all its utensils and equipment when \add ≈they're about to move camp\add*. Then¦63178 the Kohatites can come¦63197 to carry it all without touching¦63204 the \add ≈inner room\add* so they won't¦63202 die¦63208. That's the responsibility of Kohat's¦63200 descendants—\add carrying\add* the \add ≈sacred tent\add*.

\p
\v 17 Then Yahweh¦63246 told Mosheh¦63249 and Aharon,
\v 18 “Don't allow the Kohatite Levites¦63264 to \add ≈get wiped out\add* \add by mishandling the most sacred items\add*,
\v 19 \add ≈but take these precautions on their behalf so\add* they won't¦63271 die¦63272 when they approach the \add ≈most sacred¦63276 items\add*: Get Aharon and his sons¦63279 to go¦63280 and show \add ≈each of them personally\add* the \add ≈correct and proper way to do his duties\add*.
\v 20 \add ≈However,\add* they must never \add go¦63294 early\add* to \add ≈set their eyes on\add* the \add ≈sacred¦63299 objects¦63299\add*, \add ≈even briefly\add*, or they'll die¦63300.”
