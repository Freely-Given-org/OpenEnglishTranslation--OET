\p
\v 1 In April of the year¦61073 after¦61075 the Israeli people \add ≈escaped from\add* Egypt¦61077 \add (Heb.

\v 2 “\add ≈Count all the men who are Yisrael's descendants by their clans¦61090 and families, being sure to list all their names¦61094\add*.
\v 3 \add Only include those\add* who are twenty¦61101 or older and able \add to be recruited\add* as soldiers. You and Aharon must enrol¦61109 them into military¦61111 divisions¦61111.
\v 4 \add ≈The leader of each tribe¦61119 will accompany\add* you.
\p
\v 5 These are the names¦61128 of the men¦61129 who will \add ≈assist\add* you:

\v 14 Elyasaf (Reuel's¦61198 son) from Gad,
\li1
\v 15 Ahira¦61201 (Enan's¦61204 son) from Naftali.
\v 16 They¦61215 were the leaders of their tribes¦61211—chosen out of their communities¦61209, and leaders of \add units of\add* one thousand \add soldiers\add*.
\p
\v 17 Mosheh¦61219 and¦61220 Aharon¦61220 took¦61218 those men¦61222 whose names had been \add ≈given\add*
\v 18 and¦61228 they assembled the entire¦61229 community¦61231 that April. \add ≈For each tribe,\add* they recorded their¦61248 ancestry¦61241 by clan, counting the names¦61243 of those men who were twenty¦61245 or over,
\v 19 just as Yahweh¦61252 had commanded¦61251 Mosheh¦61255. \add ≈So\add* he¦61251 counted¦61256 them \add there\add* in the Sinai¦61258 wilderness¦61257,
\v 20-21 individually counting those \add in each tribe below\add* by their¦61273 clan, and only including males who were twenty¦61278 or older and able to fight in battle:
\li1 46,500 men from the tribe of Reuven,
\li1
\v 22-23 59,300 men from the tribe of Shimeon \add (Simeon¦61296)\add*,

\li1
\v 30-31 57,400 men from the tribe of Zevulun¦61406,

\v 32-33 40,500 men from the tribe of Efrayim¦61434,

\v 42-43 53,400 men from the tribe of Naftali¦61562.
\p
\v 44 Those were the ones that Mosheh¦61591 and Aharon and the twelve Israeli¦61593 leaders¦61593 (one from each tribe) listed.
\v 45 They were all the \add ≈Israelis¦61609\add* who were counted according to their¦61614 \add ≈ancestry¦61614\add*, being men who were twenty¦61616 or older, and¦61618 \add ≈capable of going off to battle\add*—
\v 46 603,550 of them in total.
\v 47 \add ≈However,\add* the Levites \add ≈weren't listed along with the other tribes¦61640\add*
\v 48 \add ≈because\add* Yahweh¦61648 had told Mosheh¦61651,
\v 49 “Don't list the Levites \add ≈or count them with the other Israelis¦61667\add*.
\v 50 \add ≈Instead,\add* appoint¦61671 \add *them\add* to manage the tent \add ≈where the copy of the agreement is kept\add*, along with all its¦61700 equipment. They must serve inside it as \add required\add*, and¦61670 they should \add ≈set their tents up around¦61701 it\add*.
\v 51 \add ≈When¦61714 it's time to leave that place\add*, the Levites¦61709 must take¦61707 \add @the tent\add* down and¦61705 when camp \add ≈is set up\add*, they must erect it \add again\add*, \add ≈but\add* any stranger who approaches it must be \add ≈executed\add*.
\v 52 \add When¦61721\add* the \add other\add* \add ≈Israelis¦61720\add* set up camp, each man¦61726 must set up with his army division¦61730 by their¦61730 banner,
\v 53 \add ≈but\add* the Levites¦61747 will camp there around¦61734 the \add ≈sacred tent\add* and¦61732 look after it¦61739. \add ≈That way,\add* the Israeli¦61744 community won't¦61737 make \add Yahweh\add* angry.
\v 54 \add ≈So¦61754 the Israelis¦61756 did everything\add* that Yahweh¦61760 had instructed¦61759 Mosheh¦61763.

\p
\v 5 Then Yahweh¦62249 told Mosheh¦62252,
\v 6 “Summon the Levites to come and stand in front¦62262 of Aharon the priest¦62264, so they can assist¦62265 him.
\v 7 They must perform¦62268 duties¦62271 for him¦62271 and for the entire¦62275 community¦62277 at and around the \add ≈sacred¦62285 tent¦62285\add*,

\p
\v 11 Then Yahweh¦62337 told Mosheh¦62340,
\v 12 “Out of all the \add ≈Israelis¦62350\add*, I've taken¦62345 the Levites instead of the \add ≈oldest son from every¦62353 family\add*. The Levites \add ≈will be the ransom for those sons¦62358\add*, and¦62360 so they¦62360 belong to me,

\p
\v 14 Then in the Sinai¦62398 wilderness¦62397, Yahweh¦62393 told Mosheh¦62396,
\v 15 “List all the male¦62411 Levites that are at least one month¦62414 old. Count them by their families and clans¦62408.”
\v 16 \add ≈So¦62418\add* Mosheh¦62420 listed them exactly as Yahweh¦62424 had commanded¦62426 him to,
\v 17 and these¦62430 were Levi's¦62433 sons¦62431: Gershon¦62435, Kohat¦62436, and Merari¦62437.
\v 18 Gershon's¦62443 sons¦62441 were: Livni¦62445 and¦62446 Shimei¦62446.
\v 19 Kohat's¦62449 sons¦62448 were: Amaran, Yitshar, Hevron, and¦62448 Uzziyel.
\v 20 Merari's¦62457 sons¦62456 were Mahli¦62459 and¦62456 Mushi¦62460.
\m Those were the families of the Levites¦62464 by their clans.
\p
\v 21 Gershon's descendants were the Livnites and¦62471 the Shimites, so they¦62474 made up the Gershonites.
\v 22 They had 7,500 males that were at least a month¦62485 old.
\v 23 The Gershonite clans¦62493 were to camp on the western side of the \add ≈sacred¦62496 tent¦62496\add*,
\v 24 and¦62500 \add *their\add* leader¦62500 was Lael's¦62508 son Elyasaf.
\v 25 Gershon's¦62513 descendants¦62511 were responsible¦62510 for the \add ≈sacred¦62516 tent¦62516\add*, including its¦62518 covering¦62518 and¦62510 the entrance¦62520 curtain,

\p
\v 27 Kohat's descendants were the Amramites, the Yitsharites, the Hevronites, and¦62544 the Uzziyelites, so they¦62554 made up the Kohatites.
\v 28 They had 8,600 males that were at least a month¦62564 old. They were in charge of the running of the \add ≈sacred¦62572 tent¦62572\add*.
\v 29 The Kohatite clans¦62574 were to camp of the southern¦62582 side of the \add ≈sacred¦62581 tent¦62581\add*,
\v 30 and¦62584 \add *their\add* leader¦62584 was Uzziyel's son Elitsafan.
\v 31 They were in charge of the box, the table¦62598 and the lampstand¦62599, the altars¦62600 and all the utensils used for ministry, the \add inside\add* curtain and its gear.
\p
\v 32 The man who organised the Levites¦62612 was Aharon's son, Eleazar¦62613 the priest¦62617. He had oversight¦62618 over all those who were responsible for the \add ≈sacred¦62621 tent¦62621\add*.
\p
\v 33 Merari's descendants were the Mahlites and¦62626 the Mushites, so they¦62629 made up the Merarites.
\v 34 They had 6,200 males that were at least a month¦62640 old,
\v 35 and¦62646 their leader¦62646 was Avihayil's son Tsuriel¦62652. They were to camp on the northern¦62660 side of the \add ≈sacred¦62658 tent¦62658\add*.
\v 36 \add *They\add* were in charge of all the frames¦62666 for the \add ≈sacred¦62667 tent¦62667\add*, its crossbars, posts, bases¦62670, all its containers and¦62662 equipment¦62673,

\p
\v 38 Mosheh¦62694 and Aharon and his sons¦62697 \add ≈set up their tents\add* \add ≈in front of\add* \add the entrance on\add* the eastern¦62687 side of the \add ≈sacred¦62700 tent\add*.

\v 39 Mosheh¦62714 and Aharon listed 22,000 Levite¦62711 males that were at least a month¦62727 old, listing them by their¦62721 clans¦62721 as \add ≈per Yahweh's instructions\add*.

\p
\v 40 Then Yahweh¦62735 told Mosheh¦62738, “List all the \add other\add* male¦62743 \add ≈Israeli¦62745\add* that are at least one month¦62748 old and \add ≈count them\add*.
\v 41 The Levites¦62758 are for me, Yahweh¦62761, in the place of the firstborn males from every \add ≈Israeli¦62766\add* family, and¦62755 their animals are in place of the \add ≈Israelis'\add* firstborn male animals.”
\v 42 \add ≈So¦62779\add* Mosheh¦62780 listed the firstborn¦62789 Israelis¦62790 exactly as Yahweh¦62783 had commanded¦62782 him to.
\v 43 and¦62793 the total number of firstborn¦62796 males a month¦62802 old or more whose names¦62799 were listed came to 22,273.
\p
\v 44 Then Yahweh¦62814 spoke¦62813 to Mosheh¦62817,
\v 45 “Take the Levites instead of every¦62825 firstborn¦62827 male Israeli¦62828, and the Levites' animals instead of their¦62835 animals, and the Levites will be mine—I am Yahweh¦62841.
\v 46 To redeem the 273 firstborn¦62852 Israelis¦62854 who outnumber¦62848 the Levites¦62851,
\v 47 collect¦62856 five silver coins for each one of them. (Use the same silver coins weighing eleven grams, that the priests use in the \add ≈sacred¦62862 tent¦62862\add*.)
\v 48 Give that \add ≈money¦62869\add* to Aharon and¦62871 his sons¦62871 as payment of the ransom¦62872 for those excess¦62873 273 males.”
\v 49 \add ≈So¦62876\add* Mosheh¦62877 collected that ransom money¦62879 to cover the ransom of the excess¦62882 \add not covered by the number of\add* Levites¦62885.
\v 50 He¦62890 collected 1,365 silver coins from the firstborn¦62888 Israeli¦62889 males (using the standard weight of silver from the sanctuary¦62901)
\v 51 and gave¦62903 \add *it\add* to Aharon and his sons¦62910 just as Yahweh¦62914 had commanded¦62916.

\v 1 Then Yahweh¦62924 told Mosheh¦62927 \add (Moses¦62927)\add* and Aharon \add (Aaron¦62930)\add*,
\v 2 “\add ≈Take¦62941 a detailed census\add* of Kohat's¦62938 male descendants by their clans¦62942 and families
\v 3 \add ≈who are from twenty-five up to fifty¦62953 years old\add* and who goes into the \add ≈sacred tent\add* to minister.
\p
\v 4 This is what the Kohatites are responsible for concerning the \add ≈sacred¦62971 tent including the inner room\add*:
\v 5 When \add ≈it's time to break camp\add*, Aharon and his sons¦62976 must enter and take¦62979 down the curtain¦62981 that veils it, and then¦62974 use that to cover¦62983 the box \add ≈containing the agreement\add*.
\v 6 Then¦62990 they must cover it with \add ?≈fine\add* leather, followed by a blue cloth, and¦62990 then¦62990 put its¦63002 \add carrying\add* poles¦63002 \add through the rings\add*.
\p
\v 7 They must spread¦63008 a blue cloth over the \add ≈sacred bread table¦63006\add*, then¦63004 place the dishes¦63018, pans, bowls¦63021, and¦63004 jugs for the drink-offerings on top of that, along with the \add ≈sacred\add* bread.
\v 8 Then¦63030 they must spread¦63030 a scarlet cloth over all that, and cover¦63035 that again with \add ?≈fine\add* leather, and then¦63030 put its¦63043 poles¦63043 \add through the rings\add*.
\p
\v 9 They must spread a blue cloth over the lampstand with its \add oil\add* lamps, its tongs and trays¦63062, and the oil containers that¦63068 are used for it.
\v 10 Then¦63074 they must wrap the lampstand and all its equipment in \add ?≈fine\add* leather, and place it \add all\add* on its carrying¦63089 frame¦63089.
\p
\v 11 Then¦63091 the must spread¦63095 a blue cloth over the gold¦63094 \add incense\add* altar¦63093, and cover¦63098 that again with \add ?≈fine\add* leather, and then¦63091 put its¦63106 poles¦63106 \add through the rings\add*.
\v 12 Then¦63108 they must get all the \add other\add* utensils that they use in the \add ≈sacred¦63119 tent¦63119\add*, and cover¦63125 that again with \add ?≈fine\add* leather, and place it \add all\add* on its carrying¦63133 frame¦63133.
\v 13 They need to remove the ashes¦63135 from the \add bronze\add* altar¦63138 and¦63139 spread¦63139 a purple¦63142 cloth¦63142 over it,
\v 14 and put all the utensils¦63150 they use on top of it: the trays, meat forks¦63160, shovel¦63163 and basins¦63166 for the altar¦63169. Then¦63144 they must cover¦63172 it with \add ?≈fine\add* leather, and then¦63144 put its poles¦63176 \add through the rings\add*.
\v 15 Aharon and his sons¦63181 must finish¦63178 covering¦63182 the \add ≈sacred tent\add* and all its utensils and equipment when \add ≈they're about to move camp\add*. Then¦63178 the Kohatites can come¦63197 to carry it all without touching¦63204 the \add ≈inner room\add* so they won't¦63202 die¦63208.

\v 16 Eleazar¦63218 (son of Aharon¦63222 the priest¦63223) is in charge¦63217 of the lamp oil and the fragrant¦63227 incense¦63226, the regular¦63229 grain¦63228 offering¦63228, the anointing¦63231 oil, and the oversight¦63232 of the \add ≈sacred¦63241 tent¦63241\add* and the inner room, including everything that's used inside them.
\p
\v 17 Then Yahweh¦63246 told Mosheh¦63249 and Aharon,
\v 18 “Don't allow the Kohatite Levites¦63264 to \add ≈get wiped out\add* \add by mishandling the most sacred items\add*,
\v 19 \add ≈but take these precautions on their behalf so\add* they won't¦63271 die¦63272 when they approach the \add ≈most sacred¦63276 items\add*: Get Aharon and his sons¦63279 to go¦63280 and show \add ≈each of them personally\add* the \add ≈correct and proper way to do his duties\add*.
\v 20 \add ≈However,\add* they must never \add go¦63294 early\add* to \add ≈set their eyes on\add* the \add ≈sacred¦63299 objects¦63299\add*, \add ≈even briefly\add*, or they'll die¦63300.”

\v 1 Then Yahweh¦63763 told Mosheh¦63766 \add (Moses¦63766)\add*,
\v 2 “Order¦63773 the \add ≈Israelis¦63772\add* that anyone with a skin disease¦63780 or a discharge¦63783, and anyone who's ‘unclean¦63785’ because¦63786 they touched a corpse¦63786, must be sent outside the camp.

\s1 Testing for an unfaithful wife

\p
\v 11 Then Yahweh¦63932 told Mosheh¦63935,
\v 12 “Tell¦63942 the \add ≈Israelis¦63941\add* that if any man's wife \add ≈has an affair\add* and is unfaithful¦63951 towards him,
\v 13 when another man secretly has sex with her, then¦63955 she becomes ‘unclean¦63966’, even though there's¦63968 no witness¦63967 against her and¦63955 she wasn't caught¦63972.
\v 14 \add ≈If the husband becomes suspicious, whether or not she's actually\add* become ‘unclean’,
\v 15 then¦64000 \add *he\add* should take \add *her\add* to a priest¦64007. He must also bring¦64034 an offering on her behalf: two litres of barley¦64016 flour¦64015. It must not have any oil or \add ≈spices mixed into it\add* because it's a grain offering for suspicion—\add ≈for determining if unfaithfulness has occurred\add*.
\p
\v 16 Then¦64037 the priest¦64039 must \add ≈lead her forward\add* and¦64037 stand¦64040 her in front¦64041 of Yahweh¦64042.
\v 17 He must \add ≈fill\add* a pottery jar with sacred¦64047 water, and¦64044 then¦64044 mix some dust from the floor¦64056 of \add Yahweh's\add* residence into the water.
\v 18 Then¦64065 the priest must stand¦64065 the woman \add ≈in front¦64070\add* of Yahweh¦64071 and¦64065 \add ≈let her hair down\add*, then¦64065 he must place the suspicion grain offering on her palm. (It's a grain offering for jealousy¦64085.) The priest must be \add ≈holding\add* the water¦64090 of bitterness¦64091 that brings¦64092 a curse¦64092
\v 19 and tell the woman¦64100 to make this oath: “If no \add other\add* man \add ≈slept\add* with you, and if you didn't¦64103 \add ≈dirty yourself while you're married\add*, then¦64094 be free from this water¦64115 of bitterness¦64116 that brings¦64117 a curse¦64117.
\v 20 \add ≈But¦64120\add* if you \add ≈have cheated on\add* your husband and become ‘unclean¦64126’ and slept with some other¦64133 guy, \add there'll be consequences\add*.
\v 21 Then¦64136 the priest will make the woman¦64140 take that curse as an oath, and \add *he'll\add* tell \add *her\add*, “Yahweh will \add ≈make your experience\add* a curse and your people¦64152 \add ≈will see the results of the\add* oath, when Yahweh gives \add ≈disease to your genitals\add* and makes¦64153 your belly swell.
\v 22 This water¦64165 will \add ≈invoke\add* the curse¦64166 to make your belly¦64170 swell¦64169 and¦64164 your \add ≈genitals shrivel\add*.” Then¦64164 the woman¦64174 must say¦64173, “Indeed, let it be so.”
\p
\v 23 Then¦64179 the priest¦64184 must write¦64179 those curses¦64182 on a scroll¦64185, then¦64179 wipe \add the ink\add* into the water¦64189 of bitterness¦64190.
\v 24 He must make the woman¦64195 drink that water¦64192 of bitterness¦64199 that brings¦64200 the curse¦64200, and¦64201 \add *it\add* will enter¦64201 into her¦64202.
\v 25 Then¦64207 he'll take the grain offering of suspicion from her hand, and hold it up \add ≈in front¦64218\add* of Yahweh¦64219, and then¦64207 take it to the altar¦64224.
\v 26 \add *He'll\add* take¦64226 some of the grain¦64230 as a memorial¦64233 portion and¦64226 burn¦64234 it on the altar¦64235. Then¦64226 he'll make the woman¦64240 drink¦64237 the water¦64243.
\v 27 \add ≈After she's drunk it\add*, if she was ‘unclean¦64252’ and unfaithful¦64253 to her husband¦64255, the water will carry that curse into her, and her belly will swell¦64261 and her \add ≈genitals will get diseased\add*, and the woman¦64266 will become¦64265 a curse among her people¦64269.
\v 28 \add ≈However,\add* if she hadn't defiled herself¦64274 and is pure, then¦64271 she'll be free and \add be able to\add* \add ≈have children\add*.
\p
\v 29 That's the rule about jealousy¦64284 when a wife¦64287 \add ≈cheats on\add* her husband¦64289 and¦64290 defiles¦64290 herself,
\v 30 or when a \add ≈husband\add* \add ≈becomes jealous¦64298 and suspicious\add* and he stands¦64303 \add ≈his wife\add* \add ≈in front¦64307\add* of Yahweh¦64308, and the priest¦64311 applies this ruling to her.
\v 31 Then¦64318 \add ≈the husband\add* will be \add ≈innocent\add*, and¦64321 that women will \add ≈bear the consequences\add* of her¦64326 wrongdoing.

\rem /s1 The Nazirites; The Nazirite; Nazirite Laws; Rules for Nazirites
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh¦64330 told Mosheh¦64333,
\v 2 “Tell¦64340 the \add ≈Israelis¦64339\add* that when any man or woman¦64346 wants to make a solemn vow to separate¦64352 themself to Yahweh¦64353 as a Nazirite¦64351,

\v 5 “For the entire time¦64406 of their vow to Yahweh¦64410 as a Nazirite¦64409, they mustn't cut their hair—they must sacred¦64411 and grow their hair long.
\p
\v 6 “For the entire time of their separation¦64421 to Yahweh¦64422, they mustn't approach any dead¦64426 body,
\v 7 even if it's their father¦64430 or mother¦64431, or brother¦64432 or sister¦64433. They mustn't defile themselves with death, because their consecration¦64440 to their god¦64441 is on their head.

\v 9 “\add ≈However,\add* if someone right next to them suddenly¦64459 died, that would defile¦64460 their consecrated¦64462 head, and¦64453 after the \add regular\add* seven¦64468 days of purification, they would have to shave their head.
\v 10 Then¦64471 on the eighth¦64472 day¦64471, they'd have to take two doves or young¦64478 pigeons to the priest¦64482 at the entrance¦64485 of the \add ≈sacred tent\add*,

\v 12 and¦64509 \add ≈restart\add* their days of separation, as well as bringing¦64515 a one-year old male lamb as a guilt¦64520 offering¦64520. (Their¦64510 initial days of separation \add ≈won't count\add* because they were made ‘unclean¦64525’.)

\v 30 \add ≈but\add* if Yahweh \add ≈does something new\add* and the ground opens¦70832 its mouth¦70836 and swallows¦70837 them and their homes and tents and \add ≈all their possessions\add*, and if they¦70850 then go¦70845 down alive¦70846 into \add ≈their grave\add*, then you'll all know¦70848 that it was because these¦70852 men¦70851 rejected Yahweh.”
\p
\v 31 \add ≈As soon as Mosheh had finished¦70858 speaking¦70859\add*, the ground below \add @those men\add* split¦70865 open
\v 32 and the earth¦70871 opened¦70870 its mouth¦70874 and swallowed¦70875 them and their homes and every¦70881 man who \add ≈backed\add* Korah¦70885 along with all \add &their\add* property.
\v 33 They went¦70891 down alive¦70897 to \add ≈their grave\add*, along with everything they owned, and then¦70891 the ground covered over them and they \add ≈vanished\add* from the \add ≈community\add*.
\v 34 All¦70908 the people who were around¦70910 them fled \add away\add* \add ≈screaming because they were afraid of getting swallowed¦70917 by the earth¦70918 as well\add*.
\p
\v 35 Then¦70920 Yahweh¦70923 \add ≈sent\add* fire¦70920 that consumed the 250 men who were presenting incense¦70930.
\s1 The incense burners
\rem /s1 The Fire Pans
\p
\v 36 Then Yahweh told Mosheh,
\v 37 “Tell the priest Eleazar (Aharon's son) to \add ≈collect the incense pans\add* from \add ≈those who were burnt\add*, and scatter the \add ≈coals far away\add* because they're sacred.
\v 38 The pans of those who \add ≈rebelled at the expense of their own lives\add* must be hammered into thin plates \add ≈to be attached\add* to the altar, because they presented them \add ≈in front\add* of Yahweh and \add now\add* they're sacred, and they'll become a \add ≈reminder\add* for the \add ≈Israelis\add*.
\v 39 \add ≈So\add* the priest Eleazar took the bronze incense burners that had been presented by those men who'd been burnt up, and they were hammered into a plating for the altar
\v 40 for a memorial for the \add ≈Israelis\add* just as Yahweh had told him via Mosheh. That's a reminder that no one who's not a descendant of Aharon is allowed to approach Yahweh with incense burners, so they don't end up like Korah and his \add ≈supporters\add*.
\s1 The people complain and cause a plague
\rem /s1 Aaron Saves the People
\p
\v 41 \add ≈However,\add* the next day the \add ≈Israelis\add* complained about Mosheh and Aharon, “\add ≈It was you who\add* killed Yahweh's people.”
\v 42 \add ≈But\add* as the community gathered \add there\add* against Mosheh and Aharon, they \add ≈looked across\add* to the \add ≈sacred\add* tent, and wow, the cloud covered over it and Yahweh's \add ≈brilliance\add* appeared.
\v 43 Mosheh and Aharon went \add over\add* to the front of the \add ≈sacred\add* tent,
\v 44 and Yahweh told Mosheh,
\v 45 “Get away from this \add ≈gathering\add* and then I'll finish them \add ≈in an instant\add*.”
\p \add ≈But\add* \add @Mosheh and Aharon\add* fell \add ≈to their knees with their faces to the ground\add*,
\v 46 and Mosheh told Aharon, “Take the incense burner, and put fire in it from the altar and incense, and take it quickly to the \add ≈people\add* and make atonement for them, because Yahweh's rage is \add already\add* \add ≈burning\add*—the plague has begun.”
\v 47 \add ≈So\add* Aharon took it as Mosheh had told \add <him\add* and ran into the middle of the \add ≈people\add*. Wow, the plague had already begun, \add ≈so he burnt\add* incense and made atonement for \add *them\add*.
\v 48 He stood between those who were dying and those still alive, and the plague was restrained.
\v 49 There were 14,700 \add >people\add* who died from the plague, in addition to those who'd died due to Korah's \add ≈rebellion\add*.
\v 50 Then Aharon returned to Mosheh at the \add ≈sacred\add* tent entrance, \add ≈as\add* the plague had been \add ≈stopped\add*.
