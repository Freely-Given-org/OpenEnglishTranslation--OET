\is1 Introduction
\ip This account was written around 400-500 B.C., at a time when other nations were being ruled over by the Persian kings. Yahweh's message is brought to the people via Petuel's son, Yoel (Joel).
\ip This document was written because God's revelation to Yoel included warnings about his coming judgement and punishment of the surrounding nations, known as \em Yahweh's day\em*. When that day arrived, it would be the time for God's punishment of all those who had disobeyed him. The prophet explained that Yahweh was calling his people to turn away from their sinful lifestyles, and then he followed this up wwith a promise that his people would again live peaceful and prosperous lives and receive his blessings. It's also recorded here how Yahweh promised to send his spirit to all people groups.
