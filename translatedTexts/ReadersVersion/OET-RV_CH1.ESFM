\v 20 Yoav's brother¦192820 Abshai, was the head of a group of three. He had killed three hundred¦192836 with is spear¦192832 and had a reputation among the three.\f + \fr 11:20 \ft This seems unexpectedly similar to verse 11 and might possibly indicate some confusion in the early records.\f*
\v 21 He was honoured¦192848 more than the other two and became the leader of that \add ?second\add* group of three, \add ≈but\add* didn't¦192855 enter the \add ?first\add* Three.
\p
\v 22 Yehoyada's son Benayah¦192860 from Kavtse'el was a powerful warrior¦192879 who did amazing things.

\v 23 He \add also\add* \add ≈killed\add* a \add ≈huge\add* Egyptian man—well over 2m tall.

\v 24 \add So\add* that was what Benayah¦192923 (Yehoyada's son) did \add ≈that gave him a reputation\add* among the three¦192930 powerful¦192931 warriors.
