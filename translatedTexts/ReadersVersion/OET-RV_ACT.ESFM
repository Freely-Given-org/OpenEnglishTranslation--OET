\mt1 Acts
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account commonly known as \bk The Acts of the missionaries of Yeshua the Messiah\bk*, is the continuation of \bk The Good Message according to Luke\bk*, and unlike most other Bibles, the \em Open English Translation\em* places these two accounts one after the other.
\is2 This account
\ip The main purpose of this account is to tell about the actions of the first followers of Yeshua the messiah. God's spirit helped them to proclaim good message about him “in Yerushalem and all across \add the provinces of\add* Yudea and Samaria, and all the way to the furthest parts of the planet” (1:8).
\ip This document has three divisions related to the expanding circles as the good message from Yeshua the messiah spread wider and wider: (1) In \bd Yerushalem\bd* where the believers start to get organised after Yeshua ascended up into the clouds; (2) the work and the message spreads wider out to all of the district of \bd Yudea\bd*; and (3) spreading more widely again around the Mediterranean Ocean and all the way to \bd Rome\bd*.
\ip It's also documented here about how God's spirit came to the believers as they were together in a room in Yerushalem at the Festival of Pentecost (fifty days after The Passover). The spirit helps and gives wisdom and strength to the believers and teachers of believers.

\s1 Introduction
\rem /s1 The Promise of the Holy Spirit; Jesus Taken Up Into Heaven
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 1:1-4.\x*Dear Theofilus¦81661, I wrote my first¦81655 account¦81656 about all the things that¦81662 \nd Yeshua\nd* began¦81663 to do and¦81668 to teach¦81669
\v 2 until¦81670 the day¦81672 when he was taken¦81682 up\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 24:51.\x* \add into the sky\add* after, with the help of the holy \nd spirit¦81678\nd*, having¦81674 commanded¦81674 the missionaries that he had chosen¦81681.
\s1 Yeshua, alive, tells them to wait
\p
\v 3 After the time¦81696 of his suffering¦81697, Yeshua presented¦81692 himself¦81693 to them in ways that were infallible proofs¦81701 \add that he was alive again\add*—appearing¦81706 to them and telling them about God's kingdom¦81715.
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4: \xt Luk 24:49.\x*Once when they were together¦81719, he told them, “\wj Don't leave Yerushalem, but wait there for what was promised¦81733 by the father¦81735, as you all have \+add already\+add* heard¦81737 me say.\wj*
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5: \xt Mat 3:11; Mrk 1:8; Luk 3:16; Yhn 1:33.\x*\wj Yohan¦81745 immersed \+add people\+add* in water¦81748, but you all will be immersed in the holy \+nd spirit¦81753\+nd* in just a few days¦81765.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua's ascension
\rem /s1 The Ascension of Jesus; Jesus Is Taken Up to Heaven
\p
\v 6 So¦81771 when they were \add next\add* gathered together¦81773, they asked him¦81776, “\nd Master¦81778\nd*, is this now the time when you'll be restoring¦81784 the kingdom¦81787 to Yisrael¦81790?”\f + \fr 1:6 \ft At the time of asking, Israelis were burdened under the rule and taxes of the Roman occupiers.\f*
\p
\v 7 But¦81796 Yeshua responded¦81795 to them, “\wj You don't¦81799 need to know¦81802 the times¦81803 or seasons¦81805 \+add when future events will happen\+add*—it's the father¦81808 who decides all that¦81806.\wj*
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8: \xt Mat 28:19; Mrk 16:15; Luk 24:47-48.\x*\wj However, you all will be receiving¦81815 power¦81816 when the holy \+nd spirit¦81820\+nd* lands on you. Then you'll tell \+add people\+add* about me in Yerushalem and all across \+add the provinces of\+add* Yudea¦81835 and Samaria¦81837, and all the way to the furthest parts of the planet.\wj*”
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9: \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:50-51.\x*After he'd said¦81846 that and¦81844 while they were still looking at him, he was lifted¦81853 up \add into the sky\add* until they could no longer see him because of the \add #clouds\add*.
\p
\v 10 As they¦81868 stood¦81878 there staring into the sky¦81871 after he'd gone, suddenly two¦81877 men¦81876 in white¦81885 clothes¦81882 were standing beside them
\v 11 and said, “You men from Galilee¦81890! Why are you still standing there looking¦81893 up at the sky? This \nd Yeshua\nd* who's been taken¦81902 up away from you into heaven will come back in the same way that¦81901 you saw him go up into heaven.”

\p
\v 12 Then they¦81919 walked down the Mt¦81923. of Olives¦81926 and returned¦81919 to Yerushalem which was less than a kilometre away.
\v 13 \x + \xo 1:13: \xt Mat 10:2-4; Mrk 3:16-19; Luk 6:14-16.\x*They went¦81944 into the upstairs¦81943 room¦81943 where¦81945 they were staying¦81947—Peter¦81950 and Yohan, Yacob and Andrew¦81958, Philip¦81959 and Thomas¦81961, Bartholomew¦81962 and Matthew¦81964, Yacob (son of Alfeus), Simon¦81970 (the Zealot member¦81972), and Yudas¦81974 (son of Yacob).
\v 14 They were united in their ongoing prayers¦81983, along with Maria¦81993 the mother¦81995 of \nd Yeshua\nd*, and his¦82002 brothers¦82001.
\p
\v 15 Then¦82003 one day, Peter¦82011 stood¦82009 up in the meeting of the believers¦82015 (about¦82028 120¦82030 of them) and¦82019 said¦82017,
\v 16 “Brothers¦82033, it was necessary¦82034 for the scripture¦82038 to be fulfilled¦82036, where the holy \nd spirit¦82043\nd* had spoken¦82041 previously¦82041 through David¦82048 about Yudas¦82050, the one who guided¦82053 those that¦82040 arrested¦82055 \nd Yeshua¦82057\nd*
\v 17 because Yudas was one of us and¦82064 took his part in our work¦82070.
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18-19: \xt Mat 27:3-8.\x*(Yudas had bought a field with the money¦82079 he had received for his treachery, and when he had fallen down \add in that field\add*, his stomach had burst¦82086 open and his intestines¦82092 had slid out \add on the ground\add*.
\v 19 So¦82095 everyone in Yerushalem started calling¦82104 that place ‘The field of blood¦82116’.)
\p
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: a \xt Psa 69:25; \xo b \xt Psa 109:8.\x*Now it was written¦82117 in the scroll¦82120 of songs¦82121:
\q1 ‘Let his place become¦82122 deserted¦82126 with no one living¦82132 there,’
\m and
\q1 ‘Let another¦82141 person take¦82140 his position.’
\p
\v 21 So¦82143 now it's appropriate¦82142 for one of the men¦82147 that has been with us for the whole time¦82151 that the \nd master¦82161 Yeshua¦82162\nd* was interacting with us,
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: a \xt Mat 3:16; Mrk 1:9; Luk 3:21; \xo b \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:51.\x*from Yeshua's immersion¦82167 by Yohan until¦82170 the day¦82172 that¦82173 he was lifted up from us \add into the clouds\add*—a witness¦82177 of the resurrection¦82179—to fill this position.
\p
\v 23 So¦82187 they¦82188 selected two¦82190 men: Yosef Barsabbas¦82195 (nicknamed Justus) and¦82199 Matthias¦82200.
\v 24 Then¦82202 they requested¦82203, “\nd Master¦82207\nd*, you know everyone's inner thoughts, so reveal¦82210 to us which¦82211 of these¦82214 two¦82216 that¦82211 you have chosen¦82212
\v 25 to take this position of service¦82228 and being a missionary—the position that¦82234 Yudas¦82236 deserted to go to his own place.”
\v 26 So¦82245 they drew straws and¦82245 Matthias¦82255 was marked so he was chosen¦82259 to join the eleven¦82263 missionaries.

\s1 God's spirit arrives and many get saved
\rem /s1 The Coming of the Holy Spirit; The Holy Spirit Comes at Pentecost
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1: \xt Lev 23:15-21; Deu 16:9-11.\x*When the Day of Pentecost actually arrived, the believers met together¦82285 in the same¦82289 room¦82289.
\v 2 Suddenly there was a noise in the sky that sounded¦82297 like a strong¦82301 wind¦82300, then¦82290 it¦82304 filled¦82304 the entire¦82306 house¦82308 where¦82309 they¦82310 were sitting¦82312.
\v 3 They saw what looked like tongues¦82317 of fire¦82319 that kept dividing¦82316\f + \fr 3:1 \ft See https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/what-%E2%80%9Cdivided-tongue%E2%80%9D-acts-2-3-0\f* and¦82320 then¦82313 settling down on each one of them.
\v 4 In this way they were all filled¦82330 with the holy spirit and¦82329 began¦82336 speaking in other¦82339 languages¦82340 as the spirit enabled them.
\p
\v 5 At the time, there were godly¦82360 Jews staying¦82356 in Yerushalem that had come from other countries¦82365 all around the world.
\v 6 When they heard this noise, lots of people¦82376 came¦82374 to investigate but they were confused¦82378 because¦82380 they heard the believers talking¦82389 in their¦82393 own languages¦82388 \add from around the world\add*.
\v 7 They were astounded¦82394 and¦82398 marvelled¦82399, asking, “Wow, aren't¦82403 these¦82408 people talking¦82411 all Galileans¦82413?
\v 8 So¦82414 how come we're hearing¦82417 them speak the languages¦82422 of the countries where we were born?
\v 9 There's people here from Parthia¦82429, Media, Elam, Mesopotamia¦82438, Yudea¦82439, Cappadocia¦82442, Pontus¦82443, Asia¦82446 \add Minor\add*,
\v 10 Frygia, Pamfylia, Egypt¦82451 \add (Mitsrayim)\add*, Libya¦82457 (near Cyrene¦82460), and visitors¦82463 from Rome,
\v 11 Crete¦82470, and Arabia¦82472. Some are Jews and some are non-Jews who've converted¦82468 \add to Judaism\add*. And we¦82473 can hear¦82473 them talking¦82474 about \nd God¦82482\nd* in our¦82477 languages¦82478.”
\v 12 Everyone was amazed¦82483 and¦82486 totally puzzled, asking each other, “What's¦82497 going on here?”
\v 13 But others¦82504 scoffed¦82506 and said, “Ha, they've just had too much to drink.”
\s1 Peter's sermon
\rem /s1 Peter Preaches to a Crowd; Peter Addresses the Crowd; Peter's Message
\p
\v 14 So the twelve stood¦82517 up and Peter¦82520 told the crowd in a loud voice¦82529, “People of Yudea and everyone staying¦82541 in Yerushalem. Listen to me so that I can explain this to you.
\v 15 This group isn't¦82556 drunk¦82562 like you're all thinking¦82560, because¦82566 it's still mid-morning,
\v 16 but¦82573 you're seeing what the prophet¦82580 Yoel¦82581 wrote about:
\q1
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17-21: \xt Yoel 2:28-32 (LXX).\x*God said, ‘In the last days¦82589 I'll pour out my¦82598 \nd spirit¦82597\nd* on all humanity—your children will tell of future events, your young¦82617 men will see visions¦82619, and¦82582 your old men will have dreams¦82627 \add from God\add*.
\v 18 I'll pour my \nd spirit¦82652\nd* out on my male and female slaves¦82635 and they'll tell of future events.
\v 19 I'll do unusual things with the stars and planets, and also down on the earth¦82668 below¦82669: blood¦82670, fire¦82672, and clouds of smoke¦82675.
\v 20 I'll make the sun¦82677 go dark and the moon¦82685 go blood¦82687 red. This will happen before¦82688 the great¦82695 victorious day¦82692 of the coming of \nd Yahweh¦82693\nd*.
\v 21 Then¦82698 everyone¦82700 who relies on the name¦82706 and¦82698 authority of \nd Yahweh¦82708\nd* will be saved¦82709.’
\p
\v 22 “Fellow Israelis, listen¦82712 to this account: You yourselves¦82746 know that¦82735 God did miracles¦82729 through \nd Yeshua\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦82718\nd*, and he fulfilled signs¦82733 \add from the scriptures\add*—in fact God did this right in front of you.
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Mat 27:35; Mrk 15:24; Luk 23:33; Yhn 19:18.\x*Then as part of God's plan and foreknowledge¦82753, this Yeshua was taken to the authorities by those who didn't follow their own laws, and you¦82763 all killed¦82763 him by having him \add nailed to\add*\x + \xo 2:23: \xt Jhn 20:25.\x* a post.
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24: \xt Mat 28:5-6; Mrk 16:6; Luk 24:5.\x*But \nd God¦82766\nd* released him from the agonies¦82770 of death and brought him back to life—death couldn't restrain¦82778 him.
\v 25 \x + \xo 2:25-28: \xt Psa 16:8-11 (LXX).\x*As David¦82782 wrote,
\q1 ‘I foresaw¦82789 \nd Yahweh¦82791\nd* always being in front of me. I refuse to be afraid because¦82797 he's there on my¦82800 right¦82799.
\q1
\v 26 Because¦82805 of that, I was happy and spoke out my¦82808 praises. My¦82808 whole body¦82821 lives in anticipation
\v 27 because¦82826 you'll never abandon¦82828 my¦82831 soul¦82830 in Hades¦82835, nor will you allow the godly¦82839 one to decay¦82842.
\v 28 You showed me the roads to life¦82847. You fill me with gladness¦82850 because of your¦82855 presence¦82854.’
\p
\v 29 “Fellow Israelis, we can tell you¦82863 all with confidence¦82861 that our patriarch¦82866 David¦82867 both died¦82870 and was buried¦82872, and his¦82877 tomb¦82876 is still here with us today.
\v 30 \x + \xo 2:30: \xt Psa 132:11; 2Sam 7:12-13.\x*So¦82887 because he was a prophet¦82886, and knowing¦82891 that \nd God¦82897\nd* has promised him to seat one of his descendants on his throne¦82916,
\v 31 he was foretelling the resurrection¦82923 of the \nd messiah¦82925\nd* who was neither¦82927 ‘abandoned¦82929 in Hades¦82936 nor did his¦82941 body¦82940 decay¦82944.’
\v 32 Then \nd God¦82951\nd* raised¦82949 this \nd Yeshua\nd* back to life and we're all witnesses¦82957 of that¦82952.
\v 33 Now he's sitting at God's right¦82962 hand¦82962, and having received¦82976 the promise¦82970 of the holy \nd spirit¦82972\nd* from the father¦82979, he poured¦82980 this out which¦82984 you're all seeing¦82990 and hearing¦82992 \add today\add*.
\v 34 \x + \xo 2:34-35: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*You see, David¦82995 never went up to the heavens¦82999, but he himself¦83004 said,
\q1 ‘\nd Yahweh¦83008\nd* said to my \nd master\nd*: Sit down on my right¦83015
\q1
\v 35 until¦83017 I defeat your¦83023 enemies¦83022.’
\p
\v 36 “So let all Yisrael \add (Israel¦83035)\add* know that this \nd Yeshua\nd* that you¦83053 executed¦83054 on a post, \nd God¦83047\nd* made him¦83040 both \nd Yahweh¦83038\nd* and¦83041 \nd messiah¦83043\nd*.”
\rem /s1 The First Converts
\p
\v 37 When the people heard¦83060 that, they were deeply troubled and asked Peter¦83076 and the other¦83079 missionaries, “What should we¦83083 do then¦83061, brothers¦83086?”
\p
\v 38 Peter¦83089 responded, “Turn away \add from your sins\add* and each one of you needs¦83098 to be immersed¦83098 by the authority of \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦83108\nd*. Then¦83090 your sins will be forgiven¦83110 and you all will receive¦83116 the gift¦83118 of the holy \nd spirit¦83121\nd*,
\v 39 because¦83124 that promise¦83127 is to you all and your¦83132 children¦83130 and to their descendants—to anyone who will call out to our¦83146 \nd God¦83145 Yahweh¦83143\nd*.”
\p
\v 40 Then Peter shared further teaching with them and¦83154 encouraged them to save themselves out from this corrupt generation¦83161.
\v 41 Because of that, those who welcomed¦83170 his¦83174 teaching were immersed¦83175 and about¦83185 three¦83186 thousand¦83186 people were added¦83177 to their numbers that day¦83181.
\rem /s1 The Fellowship of the Believers
\v 42 They continued listening to the teaching¦83193 of the missionaries, and building their relationships with each other, and breaking¦83203 bread¦83205 and praying together.
\s1 The lifestyle of the early believers
\rem /s1 The Believers Meet Together; Life among the Believers
\p
\v 43 They were serious in their learning about God, and the missionaries did many miracles and signs¦83220 of God's power in Yerushalem and all the people wanted to be right with God.
\v 44 \x + \xo 2:44: \xt Acts 4:32-35.\x*All those who did believe¦83240 were united in purpose¦83244 and¦83245 had shared use of many things.
\v 45 Some sold their properties¦83253 and possessions¦83258 and divided¦83262 them among the group so that everyone had everything they needed.
\v 46 Each day¦83276 they¦83295 \add worshipped\add* together at the temple¦83283 and¦83277 also went to various homes to break¦83290 bread¦83294 together. They talked about Yeshua at their mealtimes without sophistication,
\v 47 praising¦83302 \nd God¦83304\nd* and being popular with the people¦83312, and every¦83319 day¦83320 \nd Yahweh¦83315\nd* was adding¦83316 more that were being saved¦83318.

\s1 A lame man starts bouncing around
\rem /s1 Peter Heals a Crippled Beggar; A Lame Beggar Is Healed
\p
\v 1 One afternoon around 3pm, Peter¦83332 and¦83333 Yohan were going¦83340 to the prayer¦83352 meeting in the temple¦83343.
\v 2 Now there was a man¦83359 who had been lame from birth, and¦83356 every¦83370 day¦83371 he was placed beside a door¦83374 into the temple—an entry named ‘Beautiful¦83379 Door’. From there he could beg from the people entering¦83386 the temple.
\v 3 He saw Peter¦83399 and¦83400 Yohan about to enter¦83404 into the temple¦83407, so he asked them for a donation,
\v 4 but¦83415 Peter¦83417 and Yohan, looking closely at him¦83420 said¦83426, “Look at us!”
\v 5 So¦83432 the man grabbed onto them, expecting¦83436 to get given something¦83437 by them.
\v 6 But Peter¦83447 said¦83443, “I don't¦83452 have any silver or gold¦83451, but¦83445 I'll give you what I do have. With the authority of \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦83465\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦83467\nd*, \add I command you\add* to walk¦83471.”
\v 7 Then¦83472 Peter grabbed¦83473 the man by the right¦83476 hand¦83477 and pulled him upwards. Immediately the man's feet¦83488 and ankles¦83493 were strengthened¦83485
\v 8 and he jumped up and stood¦83496 and started walking and went¦83501 into the temple¦83506 with them, walking and skipping and praising¦83511 \nd God¦83513\nd*.
\v 9 All the people¦83519 \add there\add* saw¦83515 him¦83520 walking¦83521 and¦83522 praising¦83523 \nd God¦83526\nd*,
\v 10 and recognising¦83527 that he was the man who usually sat \add outside\add* begging at the ‘Beautiful¦83545 Door’ of the temple¦83550, they were astonished and astounded at what had happened¦83560 to him.

\p
\v 11 As the man clung onto Peter¦83572 and Yohan, all the people¦83585 ran¦83578 to see them in Solomon's¦83599 Porch and they were really astounded¦83600.

\v 12 But when Peter¦83605 saw \add the crowd\add*, he answered¦83607 their thoughts¦83623, “Fellow Israelis, why are you all puzzled about this, and why are you staring at us as if this man is walking¦83636 because of \em our\em* power¦83627 or closeness to God.”
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Exo 3:15.\x*The god of Abraham¦83640, Isaac¦83644, and Yacob¦83648—the god of our¦83654 fathers¦83653—gave honour to his¦83659 servant¦83658, \nd Yeshua\nd*, who you handed over \add to be killed\add* and then you rejected him when Pilate¦83675 had judged¦83677 him and wanted to release him.
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14: \xt Mat 27:15-23; Mrk 15:6-14; Luk 23:13-23; Yhn 19:12-15.\x*You disowned¦83690 this man¦83694 who was innocent and sinless, and instead you requested¦83692 that a murderer¦83695 be released to you.
\v 15 However in doing so, you¦83703 killed¦83703 the creator of life¦83702, who \nd God¦83706\nd* then raised¦83707 from the dead¦83709 as we¦83712 can attest.
\v 16 Now it's \add our\add* faith in the authority of Yeshua that has strengthened¦83728 \add the legs\add* of this man that you have seen and that you already knew—this authority and faith that comes from Yeshua completely¦83741 healed this man right in front¦83743 of you all.
\p
\v 17 So¦83746 now, friends, I know that you did \add all\add* that in ignorance¦83756, just like your¦83763 leaders,
\v 18 but¦83765 \add actually\add* \nd God¦83766\nd* was fulfilling¦83780 what he'd had written by the prophets¦83774, that the \nd messiah¦83778\nd* should suffer¦83776.
\v 19 Because of that, \add you¦83791 all need to\add* repent¦83782 and¦83784 turn¦83786 back \add to God\add* so that your¦83791 sins¦83793 can be erased,
\v 20 and then times¦83799 of refreshing¦83800 will come¦83798 from the presence¦83802 of \nd Yahweh¦83804\nd*, and so that he may send¦83806 \nd Yeshua¦83812\nd* the \nd messiah¦83811\nd* who's been appointed¦83808, back \add to save\add* you.
\v 21 \add For now\add* it¦83816 is appropriate¦83816 for heaven¦83817 to receive¦83819 him¦83839, until¦83820 the times¦83821 of restoration¦83823 of everything, which¦83825 \add again\add* \nd God¦83828\nd* has had written by the faithful prophets¦83840.
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Deu 18:15,18 (LXX).\x*Indeed¦83842 Mosheh said¦83844, ‘Our¦83858 \nd God¦83857 Yahweh¦83855\nd* will raise up a prophet¦83851 for you that's like one of your¦83864 own brothers¦83862. You must listen to everything he says—whatever he tells you.
\v 23 \x + \xo 3:23: \xt Deu 18:19.\x*Everyone who doesn't listen¦83887 to that prophet¦83889 will end up totally destroyed¦83891 and¦83880 not part of \add God's\add* people¦83894.’
\v 24 Similarly, the prophets¦83899 from Shemuel \add (Samuel¦83901)\add* onwards spoke in turn, and¦83897 when they spoke they foretold these¦83915 \add current\add* days¦83914.
\v 25 \x + \xo 3:25: \xt Gen 22:18.\x*And you are the descendants of those prophets¦83921, and part of the agreement between \nd God¦83929\nd* and your ancestors¦83933, when he told Abraham¦83938, ‘All the families¦83949 in the world will be blessed¦83946 by one of your descendants.’
\v 26 \nd God¦83956\nd* had raised¦83954 up his¦83960 servant¦83959 and sent¦83962 him to you \add Jews\add* first¦83953, to bless¦83965 you by turning¦83970 each of you away from your¦83979 own wicked¦83977 \add behaviour\add*.”

\s1 Peter and Yohan are threatened by the religious leaders
\rem /s1 Peter and John before the Council; Peter and John Before the Sanhedrin
\p
\v 1 While Peter and Yohan were still talking¦83980 to the people, the chief¦83992 priests¦83992 and a temple¦83998 officer¦83996 and some people from the Sadducee sect approached¦83989 them
\v 2 because¦84007 they were very upset about what they'd been teaching¦84009 the people¦84012, including preaching¦84015 that¦84026 \nd Yeshua¦84019\nd* could give life to the dead¦84029.
\v 3 So¦84030 they arrested¦84031 the two, and¦84030 as it¦84045 was already¦84048 evening¦84047, they put them in jail¦84040 overnight.
\v 4 Despite this, many people who'd heard¦84052 their message¦84054 trusted \add in Yeshua\add* and¦84056 the number¦84059 of \add families\add* who were believers¦84055 grew to around 5,000.
\p
\v 5 Then¦84069 the next day¦84071, the religious leaders and the elders¦84084 and the religious teachers¦84088 gathered¦84074 together¦84074 in Yerushalem¦84091
\v 6 along with those descended¦84113 from high priests, including Annas¦84094 the current high priest¦84098 and Caiafas and Yohan and Alexander¦84108.
\v 7 After \add having¦84116 Peter and Yohan brought in and\add* standing them in the middle, they¦84121 began to ask, “Under what authority did you¦84133 do this?”
\p
\v 8 Then Peter¦84135, having¦84136 been filled¦84136 with the holy \nd spirit¦84137\nd*, said¦84139 to them, “Rulers¦84142 of the people¦84144 and¦84145 elders¦84146,
\v 9 if we're being¦84152 questioned today¦84151 about a good¦84156 deed done to a man¦84157 who couldn't walk and which resulted in his healing,
\v 10 then you all need to know, and the people¦84172 of Yisrael should¦84165 also know, that it was done under the authority and name of \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦84179\nd*. He was the man from \nd Nazareth¦84181\nd* that you executed¦84184 on a pole, but who \nd God¦84187\nd* brought back to life. It was because of his authority that this man can now stand before¦84195 you without deformity.
\v 11 \x + \xo 4:11: \xt Psa 118:22.\x*This Yeshua is:
\q1 ‘the stone¦84201 which was rejected by you¦84206 builders¦84209,
\q1 has now become¦84212 the \add vital\add* cornerstone¦84215.’
\m
\v 12 We can't¦84221 be saved by anyone¦84221 else, because¦84227 there's¦84231 no other¦84220 name¦84229 or authority that's been given¦84239 in the entire world under¦84234 which people¦84241 can be saved.
\p
\v 13 The assembled leaders were amazed¦84264 when they saw the boldness¦84253 of Peter¦84252 and¦84249 Yohan who they knew to be illiterate¦84260, working-class men¦84259 Then¦84249 they recognised¦84265 that they'd been with \nd Yeshua\nd*,
\v 14 but since the man¦84277 who was no longer deformed was standing there with them, there was nothing¦84285 that they¦84286 could really accuse them of.
\v 15 So they had them removed from the room, and they asked each other,
\v 16 “What should we do with these¦84309 fellows? By now everyone in Yerushalem has heard about the miracle they did, and we have no way to rebuff it¦84330.
\v 17 However, we have to stop it spreading¦84339 even further, so maybe we should ban them from speaking¦84353 about this name¦84356 to anyone¦84358.”
\v 18 So¦84365 they called¦84367 them back in and¦84365 decreed that they weren't allowed to preach or teach¦84378 under the name¦84381 of \nd Yeshua¦84383\nd* anymore.
\p
\v 19 But Peter¦84387 and¦84388 Yohan answered¦84391, “You judge \add for yourselves\add* whether¦84396 it's right¦84397 in God's eyes to listen to you¦84402 rather¦84404 than to him?
\v 20 As for us, we're not able to be silent about what we saw¦84415 and heard¦84417.”
\v 21 So¦84421 after making some further¦84422 threats¦84422, the leaders sent¦84423 them off. They hadn't been able to find anything to punish¦84431 them for, because the people¦84437 were all praising \nd God¦84442\nd* for what had happened
\v 22 \add and\add* because¦84447 the man¦84453 who'd miraculously recovered was over forty¦84450 years¦84446 old.

\v 23 After Peter and Yohan had been released, they went¦84464 to their¦84466 own \add group\add* and told them what the chief¦84475 priests¦84475 and elders¦84478 had said¦84479.
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Exo 20:11; Neh 9:6; Psa 146:6.\x*When they all heard¦84482 this, they began to pray out loud to \nd God¦84494\nd*, saying, “Yahweh, you¦84498 created heaven¦84504 and earth¦84507 and the sea¦84510, and everything in them.
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25-26: \xt Psa 2:1-2 (LXX).\x*You spoke \add long ago\add* by the holy \nd spirit¦84522\nd* through our¦84520 ancestor who was your¦84531 servant¦84530, David¦84528, when you¦84531 said¦84532,

\q1
\v 26 The earthly¦84546 kings¦84544 and rulers¦84549 stood and worked together¦84550 against \nd Yahweh¦84556\nd* and against his¦84561 \nd messiah¦84560\nd*.’

\v 28 Then they did exactly what your¦84594 power and plan had already decided would happen.
\v 29 So¦84601 now, \nd Yahweh¦84604\nd*, see their¦84610 threats¦84608 and¦84611 help us, your slaves¦84614, to be able to proclaim your message¦84622 with boldness¦84618.
\v 30 Let us experience your power to heal and do miracles and things that confirm the scriptures by means of the name¦84643 \add and authority\add* of your holy servant¦84646, \nd Yeshua\nd*.”
\p
\v 31 As they finished their¦84651 requests, the place¦84654 where they had met was shaken¦84652 and all of them were filled¦84660 with the holy \nd spirit¦84667\nd*, and they \add went out and\add* boldly proclaimed God's message¦84671.

\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32: \xt Acts 2:44-45.\x*And so the group of believers¦84684 were united in their will and¦84681 attitude. No one claimed anything¦84703 to be their own, but¦84714 they shared everything they had.
\v 33 The missionaries of the \nd master¦84736 Yeshua\nd*, experienced great power¦84722 and proclaimed the truth about how he came back to life, and \add God's\add* favour was with them.
\v 34 None of them were lacking anything, because¦84758 any of them who owned properties¦84761 or houses¦84764 would sell them and donate the proceeds.
\v 35 They would lay them down in front of the missionaries, and from there it¦84782 was distributed¦84782 around according to what needs each person had.

\v 37 owned a field¦84816 which he sold, and brought¦84818 the money¦84820 and put it down in front of the missionaries.

\p
\v 1 But in contrast, a couple named Ananias¦84832 and Sapphira¦84836 sold a property¦84841
\v 2 but agreed together to hide some of the proceeds. So Ananias brought¦84854 a smaller amount and put it¦84862 down in front of the missionaries.
\v 3 Then Peter¦84867 said¦84864, “Ananias¦84870, why has Satan¦84878 filled¦84874 your¦84881 mind¦84880 such that you would lie to the holy \nd spirit¦84885\nd* and keep aside some of the proceeds of the property¦84896?
\v 4 Wasn't it yours before it was sold? And even when it was sold, the money was still yours. Why did you decide¦84913 to handle it like this? It wasn't people¦84925 that you're lying¦84924 to, but \nd God¦84928\nd*.”
\v 5 When Ananias¦84933 heard that, he fell down and¦84931 stopped¦84939 breathing¦84939. Everyone who heard about it felt very afraid,
\v 6 and the young¦84952 men¦84952 there stood up and covered¦84953 his \add body\add*, carried it out, and buried¦84957 him.
\p
\v 7 Three hours¦84962 later, Ananias' wife¦84967 came in, not knowing¦84970 anything about¦84961 what had happened.
\v 8 Peter¦84981 checked, “Is it true that you¦84992 guys sold the property¦84990 for such-and-such an amount?”
\p “Yes, for that amount,” she¦84993 replied.
\p
\v 9 But Peter¦85001 said¦85001 to her, “Why did the two of you agree¦85008 to test \nd Yahweh's spirit¦85013\nd*? The guys who just buried¦85020 your¦85023 husband¦85022 are just out the door¦85027, and they'll carry you out as well.”
\v 10 Sapphira immediately¦85035 fell down in front of him¦85040 and stopped¦85042 breathing¦85042. Then¦85034 the young¦85046 men¦85046 came in and found¦85047 her dead¦85049, so they took \add her body out\add* and buried¦85055 her with her husband¦85058.
\v 11 So¦85060 the entire¦85065 assembly¦85067 of believers became¦85061 very afraid, along with everyone else who heard about these¦85074 events.

\v 12 The missionaries went on to do many miracles and amazing things, and all the people¦85091 who gathered in Solomon's¦85105 Porch had a united vision,

\v 14 and more were becoming believers¦85124 in the \nd master¦85126\nd*—big numbers of both men and women¦85131.
\v 15 Some would even bring¦85138 those who were sick¦85140 out to the side of the road, lying them on beds and mats waiting for Peter¦85152 to come past so that \add even\add* his shadow¦85155 might touch them.
\v 16 More crowds were coming¦85170 from the towns around Yerushalem, bringing¦85182 those who were sick¦85183 and those tormented¦85185 by demons¦85189, and they were all getting healed¦85192.

\p
\v 17 But the chief¦85199 priest¦85199 and his colleagues who were members of the sect of Sadducees were filled¦85210 with jealousy¦85211 and took action
\v 18 by having the missionaries arrested¦85214 and thrown into the public¦85227 jail¦85226.
\v 19 But one of \nd Yahweh's\nd* messengers¦85235 opened¦85244 the prison¦85250 doors¦85248 during the night¦85241 and¦85253 led them out again, saying,
\v 20 “Now go and stand in the temple¦85262 and keep telling the people¦85264 all the teaching about \add new\add* life¦85269.”
\v 21 So¦85272 at dawn, having taken notice of the messenger, they went¦85273 into the temple¦85279 and started teaching¦85281 \add the people there again\add*.
\p When the chief¦85286 priest¦85286 arrived¦85282 with his companions, they called together¦85295 the \add religious\add* council and also the \add political\add* council of Yisrael, then¦85272 called for the missionaries to be brought¦85311 in from the prison¦85310.
\v 22 But when their attendants¦85319 got to the jail, they weren't there, so they returned¦85329 to the gathering and told them,
\v 23 “We found the prison¦85337 all locked up with the guards¦85346 in their positions at the doors¦85352, but¦85354 when they opened¦85353 it up, there was no one inside¦85355!”
\v 24 When they¦85360 heard¦85360 this, the officer¦85369 of the temple¦85371 and¦85372 the chief¦85374 priests¦85374 were totally puzzled as to what could have happened.
\v 25 Just then someone¦85386 came in and¦85404 told them, “Hey, the men¦85393 that you¦85395 put in prison¦85398 are in the temple¦85402—standing there teaching¦85405 the people¦85407.”
\v 26 So the temple officer¦85411 took the attendants¦85414 and went and got them, but didn't¦85419 use force¦85421 because¦85424 they were afraid that the people¦85426 might start throwing rocks at them.
\p
\v 27 So¦85432 they¦85434 brought¦85431 them in and¦85432 stood them in front of the council¦85437, where the chief¦85443 priest¦85443 addressed them,
\v 28 \x + \xo 5:28: \xt Mat 27:25.\x*“We officially commanded¦85447 you all not to be teaching in this name¦85454 and authority. But see¦85457 here, now you've filled¦85458 Yerushalem with your¦85464 teaching, and what's more, you're blaming us for the death of that man¦85475.”
\v 29 But Peter¦85481 and¦85482 the other missionaries answered¦85478, “It's better to obey \nd God¦85489\nd* than people¦85492.
\v 30 The \nd god¦85501\nd* of our¦85504 ancestors¦85503 brought \nd Yeshua\nd* back to life after you¦85508 all handed¦85509 him over to be hung up on a pole.
\v 31 But \nd God¦85515\nd* honoured this way-maker and saviour¦85518 by placing him¦85523 in the place of honour, to \add encourage\add* Yisrael to repent¦85526 and \add then\add* to forgive¦85530 their sins¦85531.
\v 32 We are witnesses¦85540 of these¦85545 messages¦85544, along with the holy \nd spirit¦85548\nd* who \nd God¦85556\nd* gave¦85554 to the ones who obey him¦85559.”
\p
\v 33 When the gathered councils heard¦85562 this, they were enraged and¦85561 wanted to kill¦85568 them,
\v 34 but¦85571 a certain¦85572 member¦85579 of the Pharisee party¦85579 named Gamaliel¦85581 stood up in the council¦85577 chamber. He was a law teacher¦85582 respected by all the community, and he ordered the \add guards\add* to take them outside¦85590 for a while,
\v 35 then¦85600 he said¦85598, “Fellow Israelis, think carefully about what you're planning to do with these¦85617 men¦85616.
\v 36 A while back, a man called Theudas¦85627 became¦85661 prominent, saying¦85628 that he was someone¦85630 important. Eventually about¦85644 four¦85646 hundred¦85646 others joined¦85637 him, but he was killed¦85649 and those who'd followed him were dispersed¦85659 and it all came to nothing¦85663.
\v 37 A bit later on, a Galilean¦85669 man named Yudas¦85667 became prominent at the time of the census and he attracted people¦85677 to him. But he also died, and all those who'd been persuaded¦85690 by him ended up being¦85690 scattered¦85692.
\v 38 So¦85693 here's my advice to you¦85699 all: pull back from \add killing\add* these¦85704 men¦85703 and allow¦85706 them \add to continue\add*, because¦85713 if this teaching and goings on is man-made, it'll be overthrown,
\v 39 but if it's from God, you all won't¦85733 be able to bring them down in case you find yourselves opposing God.”
\p So¦85756 they were persuaded¦85755 by Gamaliel,
\v 40 and after calling¦85759 in the missionaries and having them beaten, they commanded¦85763 them not to speak¦85767 using the name¦85771 and authority of \nd Yeshua¦85773\nd* and then sent¦85775 them out.
\v 41 So¦85779 the missionaries left the councils¦85786, very excited that they were considered¦85788 worthy¦85788 to be disgraced because of Yeshua.
\v 42 After that, they¦85808 never stopped teaching¦85809 and preaching¦85811 the good¦85811 message¦85811 about \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦85815\nd* in the temple¦85803 and in various homes.

\v 1 However around that time when the number of Yeshua-followers were growing, some of the Greek converts starting grumbling¦85828 about the Jewish believers because¦85834 the Greek widows¦85843 were being¦85835 overlooked¦85835 in the daily¦85841 sharing \add of food and¦85819 money\add*.
\v 2 So¦85851 the twelve¦85853 \add missionaries\add* assembled the believers together and¦85851 told them, “We're not pleased¦85862 about having to take time off \add sharing\add* the message¦85869 of \nd God¦85871\nd* to be serving¦85872 here at the \add distribution\add* tables¦85873.
\v 3 So brothers¦85881, look around you¦85885 for seven¦85889 men¦85883 who are well known to be full of \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦85891\nd* and¦85893 wisdom¦85894, so we¦85896 can appoint¦85896 them to be in charge of this part of the work.
\v 4 Then we¦85903 \add ourselves\add* can continue to pray and¦85908 share the message¦85912.”
\p
\v 5 This idea pleased¦85916 the group, so they¦85928 went ahead and chose¦85928 Stephen¦85931 (a man¦85932 full of faith¦85935 and of the holy \nd spirit¦85938\nd*), Philip¦85942, Procorus, Nicanor¦85946, Timon¦85948, Parmenas¦85950, and Nicolas¦85952 (a non-Jew from Antioch¦85954 who had previously converted¦85953 to Judaism).
\v 6 They stood¦85958 these seven up in front of the missionaries, who prayed¦85966 and¦85964 then placed their¦85969 hands¦85970 on them.

\v 7 God's message¦85973 continued spreading and the number of followers in Yerushalem was rapidly increasing, and a large number of the priests¦85991 became believers.

\p
\v 8 Now Stephen¦85999 \add (one of the seven)\add* was full of grace¦86002 and power and was doing¦86006 miracles and amazing demonstrations of God's power among¦86011 the people¦86013.
\v 9 But a group from the Freedmen¦86031 Synagogue as well as \add Jews\add* from Cyrene¦86033, Alexandria¦86035, Cilicia¦86039, and Asia¦86041 \add Minor\add* rose up and started arguing against Stephen¦86044,
\v 10 but they weren't able to refute the wisdom¦86051 that he spoke \add with the help of\add* the pure \nd spirit¦86058\nd*.
\v 11 So they¦86079 got some men¦86080 \add to falsely accuse Stephen\add* saying¦86081, “We heard¦86084 him¦86085 denigrating Mosheh and¦86093 \nd God¦86095\nd*.”
\v 12 So¦86097 they stirred¦86096 up the people¦86099 and the elders¦86102 and the law teachers¦86105 and so they approached¦86107 \add Stephen\add* and arrested him and brought¦86111 him to the council¦86115 \add chambers\add*.
\v 13 There they¦86117 produced the false¦86120 witnesses¦86119 saying¦86123, “This man¦86127 won't¦86129 stop spreading messages¦86134 against this holy \add temple\add* and against the law
\v 14 because¦86146 we¦86145 heard¦86145 him¦86147 saying¦86148 that that \nd Yeshua\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦86152\nd* will be tearing¦86154 down this building and¦86158 will be changing¦86159 the traditions that Mosheh gave¦86164 to us.”
\v 15 So¦86167 then¦86167 the council¦86181 members looked¦86168 across at Stephen and¦86167 saw that his¦86186 face \add was shining\add* like that of one \add of God's\add* messengers¦86189.

\p
\v 1 Then¦86195 the chief¦86197 priest¦86197 asked \add Stephen\add*, “Is all this true?”
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 7:2-3: \xt Gen 12:1.\x*And he replied, “My brothers¦86211 and¦86207 fathers¦86213, please listen¦86214. Our¦86222 honoured \nd God¦86216\nd* was seen¦86219 by our¦86222 ancestor Abraham¦86223 in Mesopotamia¦86227 before¦86228 he moved to Haran¦86233
\v 3 and he told him, ‘Leave your land and your relatives¦86247, and go to the place that I will show you.’
\v 4 \x + \xo 7:4: a \xt Gen 11:31; \xo b \xt Gen 12:4.\x*So¦86269 he left Chaldea¦86264 and moved to Haran¦86268, and then¦86269 after¦86272 his¦86277 father¦86276 died, he moved again to this land where we now live.
\v 5 \x + \xo 7:5: \xt Gen 12:7; 13:15; 15:18; 17:8.\x*Abraham hadn't received any land here as an inheritance¦86301, in fact he'd never been near this land and nor did he have any children¦86328, yet God promised¦86309 to give¦86311 this \add entire\add* country to him and his¦86321 descendants¦86320.
\v 6 \x + \xo 7:6-7: \xt Gen 15:13-14.\x*And yet \nd God¦86334\nd* \add also\add* told him¦86342 that his¦86342 descendants¦86340 would end up staying in another¦86346 country where they would be enslaved¦86348 and mistreated¦86352 for four¦86355 hundred¦86355 years¦86354.
\v 7 \x + \xo 7:7: \xt Exo 3:12.\x*However \nd God¦86369\nd* promised to punish the nation¦86359 that enslaved them, and told him that in the end they would leave that place¦86381 and serve¦86363 him here in this country¦86359.
\v 8 \x + \xo 7:8: a \xt Gen 17:10-14; \xo b \xt Gen 21:2-4; \xo c \xt Gen 25:26; \xo d \xt Gen 29:31–35:18.\x*And he contracted with Abraham about being circumcised, and so when Abraham had Isaac, he circumcised him on the eighth¦86400 day¦86397, and then¦86383 Isaac went on to have Yacob, and Yacob to have the \add twelve\add* tribal leaders.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 7:9: a \xt Gen 37:11; \xo b \xt Gen 37:28; \xo c \xt Gen 39:2,21.\x*Those brothers went on to become jealous¦86415 of Yosef and¦86412 sent him back into Egypt¦86420 \add as a slave\add*, but \nd God¦86424\nd* was with him
\v 10 \x + \xo 7:10: \xt Gen 41:39-41.\x*and rescued¦86428 him out of all his¦86434 troubles there. Then God gave¦86436 him wisdom¦86441 and caused him to gain the favour¦86438 of \add Far'oh (Pharaoh¦86444)\add*, the king¦86445 of Egypt, who then appointed¦86448 him as the ruler of all Egypt and over Far'oh's own household¦86457.
\v 11 \x + \xo 7:11: \xt Gen 42:1-2.\x*Then¦86461 a famine¦86462 hit all Egypt¦86470 and Canaan¦86472 causing great¦86475 distress and our¦86482 ancestors¦86481 were unable to find enough food.
\v 12 But Yacob¦86486 heard¦86483 that grain¦86488 was available in Egypt¦86492, so first¦86501, he sent¦86494 off our¦86500 tribal leaders.
\v 13 \x + \xo 7:13: a \xt Gen 45:1; \xo b \xt Gen 45:16.\x*On their second¦86506 visit, Yosef revealed himself to them, and¦86513 so Far'oh became¦86515 aware of Yosef's heritage.
\v 14 \x + \xo 7:14: a \xt Gen 45:9-10,17-18; \xo b \xt Gen 46:27 (LXX).\x*Then¦86525 Yosef¦86526 sent¦86524 for his¦86531 father¦86530 Yacob¦86528 and¦86533 all the extended family—some seventy-five of them.
\v 15 \x + \xo 7:15: a \xt Gen 46:1-7; \xo b \xt Gen 49:33.\x*So¦86544 Yacob¦86547 went¦86545 to Egypt¦86549, where he and¦86544 the \add twelve\add* tribal leaders eventually died¦86551,
\v 16 \x + \xo 7:16: \xt Gen 23:3-16; 33:19; 50:7-13; Josh 24:32.\x*although their bodies were moved to Shekem where they were put into the tomb¦86567 that¦86569 Abraham¦86571 had bought from the sons¦86576 of Hamor.
\p
\v 17 \x + \xo 7:17-18: \xt Exo 1:7-8.\x*But as the time¦86588 limit promised¦86593 to Abraham¦86598 by \nd God¦86596\nd* was getting closer, \add our\add* people¦86601 multiplied¦86603 in Egypt¦86605
\v 18 until¦86606 another¦86610 Far'oh \add (Pharaoh)\add* ended up ruling there who had never known¦86616 Yosef.
\v 19 \x + \xo 7:19: a \xt Exo 1:10-11; \xo b \xt Exo 1:22.\x*He took advantage¦86623 of us Jews and mistreated¦86627 our¦86626 ancestors¦86629, even forcing them apart from their¦86637 own babies¦86635 so they wouldn't live.
\v 20 \x + \xo 7:20: \xt Exo 2:2.\x*Mosheh was born during that time¦86644 and¦86648 \nd God¦86652\nd* considered him beautiful¦86650. He spent three¦86656 months¦86655 in his \add own\add* father's¦86661 house¦86659
\v 21 \x + \xo 7:21: \xt Exo 2:3-10.\x*before being placed outside, from where Far'oh's¦86676 daughter¦86675 took¦86672 him and¦86666 brought¦86678 him up herself¦86681 as her own son.
\v 22 So¦86684 Mosheh was instructed¦86685 in all the wisdom¦86691 of the Egyptians, and was a powerful¦86697 speaker and project leader.
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 7:23-29: \xt Exo 2:11-15.\x*But when he hit forty¦86710, it entered his mind¦86715 to visit¦86717 his relatives, the Israelis.
\v 24 When he noticed one of them being mistreated, he retaliated¦86731 and while defending the oppressed man, he struck¦86738 \add and killed\add* the Egyptian.
\v 25 He thought his¦86759 relatives would understand¦86750 that \nd God¦86756\nd* was bringing salvation¦86762 to them via him¦86759, but¦86766 they¦86764 didn't¦86767 see it that way.
\v 26 So¦86771 on the following¦86772 day¦86773 when he saw two of them quarrelling¦86776, he tried to resolve the situation by saying, ‘Men, you're all brothers¦86793. Why are you injuring¦86798 each other?’
\v 27 But the bullying one pushed¦86806 him¦86807 away and¦86813 said¦86808, ‘Who made you¦86810 the judge¦86814 over us?
\v 28 Do you want to kill¦86819 me like you killed¦86825 that Egyptian yesterday¦86826?’
\v 29 \x + \xo 7:29: \xt Exo 18:3-4.\x*When he heard that, Mosheh fled \add Egypt\add* and¦86834 became¦86841 an exile in Midian¦86845 where¦86846 he \add eventually\add* had two¦86849 sons¦86848.
\p
\v 30 \x + \xo 7:30-34: \xt Exo 3:1-10.\x*After another forty¦86858 years¦86856, he was in the wilderness¦86863 around Mt¦86865. Sinai¦86867 when he saw a messenger¦86868 in the flame¦86871 of a burning thorn¦86875 bush.
\v 31 Mosheh was amazed at the vision¦86883 when he saw it, so he approached¦86885 \add the bush\add* to look more closely when he heard Yahweh's voice¦86891 saying,
\v 32 ‘I am the god of your¦86905 ancestors¦86904—the god of Abraham¦86908 and of Isaac¦86912 and of Yacob¦86916.’ At that point, Mosheh started trembling¦86917 and was scared to go any closer to look,
\v 33 but \nd Yahweh¦86936\nd* said¦86928, ‘Take off your¦86945 sandals¦86940, because¦86947 the ground¦86956 you're standing on is dedicated to God.
\v 34 I have noticed the mistreatment¦86964 of my¦86967 people¦86966 in Egypt and heard¦86976 their¦86974 groaning¦86973 and so I came¦86979 down to rescue¦86980 them, so now I'm going to send¦86985 you¦86987 \add back\add* to Egypt.’
\p
\v 35 \x + \xo 7:35: \xt Exo 2:14.\x*This was the same Mosheh that they had previously rejected and asked who had made him ruler and judge¦87001 over them. Now \nd God¦87006\nd* had indeed sent him as ruler and liberator by means of the messenger¦87018 that he saw in the thorn¦87024 bush.
\v 36 \x + \xo 7:36: a \xt Exo 7:3; \xo b \xt Exo 14:21; \xo c \xt Num 14:33.\x*So eventually Mosheh led them out of Egypt¦87036 after doing miracles and signs¦87032 of God's power there, and then also at the Red Sea and during the forty years¦87046 in the wilderness¦87045.
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37: \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*This same Mosheh told Israelis that in the future \nd God¦87062\nd* would raise up another prophet¦87057 like him from among them.
\v 38 \x + \xo 7:38: \xt Exo 19:1–20:17; Deu 5:1-33.\x*Now Mosheh was the person that \add led\add* the assembly¦87081 \add of people\add* in the wilderness¦87084, was spoken to by one \add of God's\add* messengers¦87087 on Mt¦87093. Sinai¦87094, and¦87095 one of our¦87099 ancestors¦87097 that received¦87102 living¦87105 messages to pass on to us.
\p
\v 39 “Yet our¦87117 ancestors¦87116 didn't¦87111 want to obey that man, so they rejected him and started thinking about Egypt¦87133 again,
\v 40 \x + \xo 7:40: \xt Exo 32:1.\x*saying to Aaron¦87136, ‘Make some gods¦87139 for us to lead us because¦87144 we've got no idea what happened to that Mosheh who led us out of Egypt¦87154.’
\v 41 \x + \xo 7:41: \xt Exo 32:2-6.\x*So¦87161 together they made a calf as an idol¦87172 to bring sacrifices¦87170 to, and¦87161 they were pleased with what they'd achieved.
\v 42 \x + \xo 7:42-43: \xt Amos 5:25-27 (LXX).\x*But \nd God¦87185\nd* turned¦87181 and allowed them to serve the heavenly¦87193 armies, just as the prophets¦87199 wrote¦87195,
\q1 ‘It wasn't me that you Israelis sacrificed¦87203 to for those forty years¦87206 in the wilderness¦87210.
\q1
\v 43 You turned to Molech's tent and¦87218 Refan's star¦87226 as your¦87229 gods by making images¦87232 of them to bow down to. So¦87218 for that¦87234, I'll send you all away into exile beyond¦87244 Babylon.’
\p
\v 44 \x + \xo 7:44: \xt Exo 25:9,40.\x*The tent of evidence was with our¦87255 ancestors¦87253 in the wilderness¦87258—made to the pattern¦87272 that God had shown Mosheh.
\v 45 \x + \xo 7:45: \xt Josh 3:14-17.\x*Our¦87282 ancestors¦87281 then carried that¦87276 tent into the land, having¦87279 inherited¦87279 it along with Joshua from the possession¦87288 of the pagans which¦87276 \nd God¦87294\nd* drove¦87292 out ahead of them. The tent remained there until¦87301 the time of David¦87304
\v 46 \x + \xo 7:46: \xt 2Sam 7:1-16; 1Ch 17:1-14.\x*who found¦87306 favour¦87307 with \nd God¦87310\nd* and¦87311 requested¦87312 to find a tent for the house¦87317 of Yacob¦87319,
\v 47 \x + \xo 7:47: \xt 1Ki 6:1-38; 2Ch 3:1-17.\x*but¦87321 it was Solomon¦87320 who built¦87322 the house¦87325 for God \add to reside in\add*.
\p
\v 48 However the highest¦87330 one doesn't actually live in structures made by people, but¦87326 as the prophet¦87340 wrote,

\q1
\v 50 Wasn't it me that created everything?’
\p
\v 51 \x + \xo 7:51: \xt Isa 63:10.\x*You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised¦87380 hearts¦87385 and ears¦87389! You're always¦87391 opposing¦87396 the holy \nd spirit¦87393\nd* just like your¦87401 ancestors¦87400 were.
\v 52 Which¦87405 one of the prophets¦87407 wasn't persecuted¦87409 by your¦87413 ancestors¦87412?

\p
\v 54 When they heard that, they were raging inside and¦87446 grating¦87454 their¦87456 teeth¦87457 at him¦87459.
\v 55 But being¦87460 full of the holy \nd spirit¦87465\nd*, Stephen stared up into the sky and¦87474 was able to see God's splendour, as well as seeing \nd Yeshua\nd* standing there on God's right¦87480.
\v 56 He said¦87486, “I can look through the sky that's opened¦87491 up and can see humanity's child standing at God's right¦87500 side.”
\p
\v 57 At this point, they blocked their¦87511 ears¦87510 and rushed¦87513 together to grab Stephen, yelling loudly¦87507.
\v 58 They drove him out of the city¦87522 and¦87517 then¦87517 started throwing¦87518 rocks at him. His accusers left their¦87532 cloaks in the care of a young¦87537 man¦87537 named¦87539 Saul¦87540.
\v 59 As Stephen¦87544 was being hit by the rocks, he called out, “\nd Master¦87548 Yeshua\nd*, receive¦87552 my¦87555 spirit¦87554.”
\v 60 Then¦87557 falling to his knees¦87559, just before he died he called out loudly¦87563, “\nd Master¦87566\nd*, don't¦87567 hold this sin¦87574 against them.”

\p That same day¦87593, intense persecution¦87594 began against¦87599 the assembly¦87601 in Yerushalem, and so the believers fled throughout¦87609 the regions¦87611 of Yudea¦87613 and Samaria¦87615, except¦87616 for the twelve who stayed.

\v 5 Around the same time, Philip¦87667 went to a city¦87672 in Samaria¦87675 and told them about the \nd messiah¦87679\nd*.
\v 6 Crowds gathered and listened carefully to Philip¦87694 and watched him do miracles—

\v 8 so there were a lot of happy people there.
\s1 Simon the magician seeks power
\rem /s1 Simon the Sorcerer
\p
\v 9 One man¦87742 in the city¦87751 had been practicing¦87752 magic¦87752 and amazing¦87754 the people¦87757, and he claimed that he was someone¦87762 great¦87764. His name¦87745 was Simon¦87746
\v 10 and the people there from the least to the most important said, “This power is from the great \nd god¦87778\nd*.”
\v 11 They gave him¦87784 a lot of attention because¦87785 he'd been amazing them with magic¦87790 for quite a long time¦87788.
\v 12 However when Philip¦87798 started preaching¦87800 the good message about God's kingdom¦87805 and the name and authority of \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦87814\nd*, they believed¦87795 the message, and many men and women¦87819 asked to be immersed¦87815 \add in water\add*.
\v 13 Simon¦87822 himself¦87824 also believed¦87825 and was immersed¦87827, and then¦87821 started accompanying Philip¦87832 around—marvelling¦87844 as he observed¦87833 the miracles¦87839 and signs¦87837 of God's power.
\p
\v 14 When the missionaries in Yerushalem heard¦87846 that many people from Samaria¦87856 had accepted God's message¦87858, they¦87862 sent¦87862 Peter¦87866 and¦87867 Yohan out to them
\v 15 so then they prayed¦87871 for them to receive¦87875 the holy \nd spirit¦87876\nd*.
\v 16 (The holy spirit hadn't fallen¦87886 on any of them at that point, but¦87888 they¦87890 had only been immersed¦87889 into the name¦87893 and authority of the \nd master¦87896 Yeshua\nd*.)
\v 17 So Peter and Yohan placed their¦87902 hands¦87903 on the new believers and they received¦87907 the holy \nd spirit¦87908\nd*.
\p
\v 18 When Simon¦87914 the magician saw that they received the \nd spirit¦87925\nd* after having¦87910 the hands¦87920 of the missionaries placed on them, he offered¦87928 money¦87931 to Peter and¦87912 Yohan, saying,
\v 19 “Give me this authority¦87938 so that anyone who I place \em my\em* hands¦87947 on will receive¦87948 the holy \nd spirit¦87949\nd*.”
\p
\v 20 But Peter¦87951 responded¦87953, “May your money¦87974 join you in your destruction¦87965 because¦87966 you thought¦87971 you could buy God's gift¦87968 with it¦87963.
\v 21 There's¦87978 no role for you here and no part for you in our work because¦87988 your¦87990 heart¦87989 isn't¦87991 right¦87993 with \nd God¦87998\nd*.

\v 23 because¦88024 I perceive that you¦88034 have a bitter¦88026 attitude and¦88028 ungodly habits.
\p
\v 24 Simon¦88039 answered¦88036, “Oh, please ask the \nd master¦88053\nd* on my behalf that¦88065 none of what you¦88067 mentioned will happen to me.”

\v 26 Then a messenger¦88099 from \nd Yahweh¦88101\nd* spoke¦88102 to Philip¦88104, “Start walking and head south¦88112 on the road that¦88118 goes downhill from Yerushalem to Gaza¦88124 through the wilderness¦88127.”
\v 27 So¦88128 he headed off, and¦88128 \add on the road\add* he came across an important official¦88136 of the Ethiopian¦88134 queen\f + \fr 8:27 \ft Some translations list the queen's name as ‘Candace’, but that was the name of the series of queens, cf., Far'oh (Pharaoh) or Caesar which came to be used as a title for more than one person.\f* who was in charge of her¦88148 treasury¦88147. This man¦88133 had been in Yerushalem to worship God
\v 28 and was returning¦88159 home in his¦88165 chariot¦88164. As he rode, he was reading¦88167 \add the scroll of\add* the prophet¦88173 Yeshayah,
\v 29 and the \nd spirit¦88178\nd* told Philip¦88180 to approach him and stay by the chariot¦88185.
\v 30 So¦88189 Philip¦88191 ran up to the chariot and heard¦88192 the man reading from the prophet¦88197 Yeshayah and asked, “Do you know what it is that you're¦88205 reading about?”
\p
\v 31 “How could I know when I don't¦88217 have someone¦88218 to guide me?” he answered, and so he invited Philip¦88226 to climb up and sit¦88228 with him.
\v 32 Now the particular passage¦88233 that¦88236 he was reading¦88237 was this:\x + \xo 8:32-33: \xt Isa 53:7-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘He was led away like a sheep¦88241 being led to the slaughterhouse¦88243,
\q1 and¦88232 stayed as silent¦88255 as a lamb being shorn
\q2 so he never opened his¦88261 mouth¦88260.
\q1
\v 33 He was humiliated¦88264 by a lack of justice¦88267.
\q1 Who can name his descendants,
\q2 because his life¦88282 is being¦88277 taken from the earth¦88280?’
\p
\v 34 “Now tell me,” said¦88290 the official, “who was Yeshayah talking about? Was he talking about himself¦88300 or someone¦88304 else?”
\v 35 So¦88306 Philip¦88308 started with that passage and¦88306 explained the good¦88319 message¦88319 about \nd Yeshua¦88322\nd* to him.
\v 36 As they were going¦88325 along¦88326 the road¦88328, they came to some water, and¦88324 the official asked, “Look¦88337, here's some water. What would stop me from being immersed¦88342 here?”
\p
\v 37 ◘
\v 38 So¦88366 he commanded¦88367 \add the driver\add* to stop the chariot¦88370 and they both climbed down, and Philip¦88379 immersed¦88384 the official in the water¦88376.
\v 39 But as they came out of the water¦88391, \nd Yahweh's spirit¦88392\nd* snatched¦88401 Philip¦88403 away and so the official never saw¦88406 him again, but¦88387 he continued on his¦88416 journey very happy.
\v 40 As for Philip¦88418, he found¦88420 himself at \add the town of\add* Azotus¦88422, and as he passed through¦88424 \add the coastal towns\add* on the way to Caesarea¦88435, he proclaimed the good¦88425 message¦88425 in each town.

\s1 Yeshua talks to Saul
\rem /s1 The Conversion of Saul; Saul's Conversion
\r (Acts 22:6-16; 26:12-18)
\p
\v 1 Meanwhile Saul¦88438 was still¦88440 spouting off murderous¦88444 threats¦88442 towards¦88445 the followers of the \nd master¦88449\nd*. He went to the chief¦88452 priest¦88452
\v 2 and obtained \add official\add* letters¦88457 to enable him to enter the Jewish¦88463 meeting¦88463 halls¦88463 in Damascus¦88459 so that if he found either male or female followers of Yeshua, he could arrest them and bring¦88478 them to Yerushalem in chains.
\p
\v 3 On his journey as he approached Damascus¦88489, suddenly¦88491 light¦88496 from the sky¦88501 flashed¦88495 around¦88495 him.
\v 4 He dropped to his knees\f + \fr 9:4 \ft It seems most likely that Paul and company were walking to Damascus (and not on horseback despite paintings by Caravaggio and others). The journey of somewhere around 300km would have taken around two weeks.\f* and heard¦88507 a voice¦88508 calling, “Saul, Saul, why are you¦88515 persecuting¦88515 me?”
\p
\v 5 “Who are you, master¦88521?” he¦88516 asked.
\p And the voice replied, “I'm \nd Yeshua\nd*, the one that you're¦88532 persecuting¦88533.
\v 6 Now, stand up and go into the city¦88561, and you'll be told there what you need to do.”
\p
\v 7 Meanwhile his travelling¦88574 companions had stood¦88576 there speechless¦88577, because they'd heard the voice¦88581 but couldn't see anyone¦88579.
\v 8 They helped Saul¦88589 up from the ground¦88592, but even when he opened¦88593 his¦88598 eyes¦88597, he couldn't see anything. So¦88587 they had to lead him into Damascus¦88607 by hand¦88602.
\v 9 Saul stayed there for three¦88611 days¦88610, unable to see and¦88614 not eating or drinking anything.
\s1 Ananias restores Saul's sight
\p
\v 10 Now there was a believer there in Damascus¦88626 named Ananias, and¦88622 the master spoke to him in a vision¦88636, calling, “Ananias.”
\p “I'm here, master,” he answered.
\p
\v 11 So¦88647 the \nd master¦88648\nd* told him¦88650, “Get up and¦88660 go to Yudas' house¦88663 in Straight¦88659 Street where you'll find a man named Saul¦88665 from Tarsus¦88667. He's praying¦88670 right now
\v 12 and in his vision¦88675, he saw¦88672 a man¦88673 named Ananias¦88678 who comes in and places his hands¦88686 on him so that he can receive¦88688 his sight¦88688 back.”
\p
\v 13 But¦88690 Ananias¦88692 resisted, “\nd Master¦88693\nd*, I've heard¦88695 a lot about that man¦88700, including all the evil¦88703 things he's done to your¦88707 dedicated people in Yerushalem,
\v 14 and¦88712 the reason he's here in Damascus with the authority¦88715 of the chief¦88718 priests¦88718 is to arrest everyone who trusts in you¦88725.”
\p
\v 15 But the \nd master¦88731\nd* said¦88726, “Go now, because¦88733 I've chosen that¦88740 man¦88739 to be a bearer of my¦88744 name¦88743 and authority both in other countries, even to their kings¦88750, and to the descendants of Yisrael,
\v 16 because¦88755 I'll be showing¦88756 him what he's going to have to suffer¦88765 for bearing my¦88764 name¦88763.”
\p
\v 17 So¦88768 Ananias¦88769 left and went¦88766 into Yudas' house¦88774 where he placed his hands¦88780 on Saul and said¦88783, “Brother Saul, the \nd master¦88787\nd* has sent¦88788 me here—\nd Yeshua\nd* the one you saw on the road¦88796 when you were coming¦88798 here—so that¦88797 you'll be able to see again and also be filled¦88803 with the holy \nd spirit¦88804\nd*.”
\v 18 Immediately something¦88808 like scales¦88816 fell off Saul's eyes¦88812 and he was able to see again, and he got up¦88823 and got immersed¦88825 in water,
\v 19 before getting something to eat to renew his strength¦88830.
\s1 Saul starts preaching in Damascus
\rem /s1 Saul Preaches in Damascus; Saul in Damascus and Jerusalem
\p Then¦88832 Saul stayed several days¦88840 with the believers in Damascus¦88838.
\v 20 He went straight into the Jewish¦88847 meeting¦88847 halls¦88847 and¦88843 started proclaiming¦88848 that \nd Yeshua\nd* is God's son.
\p
\v 21 The hearers were all amazed¦88859, saying¦88867, “Isn't this the guy that persecuted¦88872 the ones following that Yeshua in Yerushalem, and even came to Damascus to arrest them here and take them back to the chief¦88895 priests¦88895?”
\p
\v 22 But Saul was growing stronger\f + \fr 9:22 \ft It's not clear here whether it means that Saul was growing physically stronger, or that his preaching and debating skills were improving.\f* and he was confounding¦88903 the Jews living¦88907 in Damascus¦88909 as he taught¦88910 them that Yeshua is the \add promised\add* \nd messiah¦88915\nd*.
\rem /s1 Saul Escapes from the Jews
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 9:23-25: \xt 2Cor 11:32-33.\x*After several days¦88919, the religious Jews plotted¦88921 together¦88921 to kill¦88924 him¦88925,
\v 24 but Saul¦88929 found out about their¦88932 plan. Those Jews were also watching¦88934 the city exits so they could kill¦88949 him if he tried leaving,
\v 25 but his¦88955 supporters took him to the city wall at night¦88956 time and lowered¦88964 him down in a basket¦88966.
\s1 Saul goes to Yerushalem but has to leave
\rem /s1 Saul in Jerusalem
\p
\v 26 When he got back to Yerushalem, Saul attempted¦88976 to join in with the believers there but¦88981 they were all scared of him, not believing¦88986 that he was a true follower of Yeshua.
\v 27 However Barnabas¦88990 took Saul and brought¦88994 him to the twelve, and Saul told them how he had seen the \nd master¦89007\nd* on the road¦89004, and been spoken to by him, and how he had spoken boldly¦89016 in Damascus¦89015 in the name¦89019 and authority of \nd Yeshua\nd*.
\v 28 So¦89023 Saul stayed connected with the believers, going¦89029 in and out of Yerushalem and speaking¦89035 boldly¦89035 in the name¦89038 and authority of the \nd master¦89040\nd*.
\v 29 He also talked and¦89044 debated¦89045 with the Greek-speaking Jews, but¦89052 they¦89051 wanted to kill¦89055 him¦89056,
\v 30 so when the brothers¦89061 found out, they took Saul down to Caesarea¦89066 \add on the coast\add*, and from there sent¦89068 him \add on a ship\add* to Tarsus¦89072.
\p
\v 31 After that the assemblies¦89078\f + \fr 9:31 \ft Lit. ‘assembly’ (singular). Jonathan Leeman in ‘One Assembly’ makes a good case that the force of κατά ‘throughout’ contributes to making the force of ἐκκλησία plural in this sentence (similar to Luke's use in Luke 4:14, 23:5, Acts 9:42, 10:37).\f* of believers throughout Yudea¦89082 and Galilee¦89084 and Samaria¦89086 had peace¦89089 and grew in their respect and service of the \nd master¦89099\nd*, as well as increasing in numbers through the encouragement of the holy \nd spirit¦89105\nd*.
\s1 Peter heals Aeneas

\p
\v 32 Peter¦89110 travelled around the country and¦89109 then¦89109 went to visit the dedicated believers in Lydda¦89122.
\v 33 He saw a paralysed¦89141 man¦89127 named Aeneas who'd spent eight¦89134 years¦89133 lying¦89135 on his pallet¦89138,
\v 34 and said¦89143 to him¦89144, “Aeneas, \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦89154\nd* is healing¦89148 you¦89149. Stand up and pack up your bed.” And straight away Aeneas stood up
\v 35 and all the people living¦89168 in Lydda¦89169 and Sharon¦89173 who saw¦89163 him¦89165 became followers of the \nd master¦89178\nd*.
\s1 Peter brings Tabitha back to life
\rem /s1 Peter in Lydda and Joppa
\p
\v 36 Then¦89181 in Yoppa¦89180 there was a believer named Tabitha¦89186 (or Dorcas if translated) and¦89197 she¦89200 did a lot of good¦89196 things as well as being generous to the poor.
\v 37 Around that time she¦89208 got sick and¦89202 died. After washing her¦89212 body, they¦89213 placed it¦89201 in an upper¦89217 room¦89217,
\v 38 and since Yoppa¦89224 was near Lydda¦89221 and the believers had heard¦89227 that Peter¦89229 was there, they¦89233 quickly sent¦89233 two¦89234 men¦89235 to request, “Please come as soon as possible.”
\v 39 So¦89247 Peter¦89249 went¦89250 with them, and when they arrived¦89253 in Yoppa they took him up to the room¦89259. All the widows¦89265 stood¦89261 there, sobbing and showing¦89268 him various clothes¦89271 that Tabitha had made for them.
\v 40 But¦89308 Peter had them all removed from the room, and then¦89308 kneeling down he prayed¦89298 before turning back to the body¦89303 and said¦89304, “Tabitha¦89305, get up.” Then¦89308 she opened¦89309 her¦89312 eyes¦89311, and seeing Peter there she sat¦89317 up.
\v 41 Peter helped her to stand up, then¦89320 he called¦89326 the believers and the widows¦89332, and presented¦89336 the live Tabitha to them.
\v 42 News of this spread throughout¦89342 Yoppa¦89345 and¦89346 many people there believed¦89348 in the \nd master¦89352\nd*.
\v 43 So¦89354 Peter¦89362 stayed on there for quite a few days¦89356, living with a tanner¦89366 of hides named Simon¦89365.

\s1 Peter and Cornelius each hear from God
\rem /s1 Peter and Cornelius; Cornelius Calls for Peter
\p
\v 1 Just up in Caesarea¦89372 there was a Roman army commander named Cornelius¦89374 (leader of the ‘Italian¦89380 Regiment’)
\v 2 who, along with all his household¦89389, worshipped God and obeyed his laws. He gave to the poor and regularly asked God for help.
\v 3 One afternoon around 3pm he had a vision¦89405 where he clearly¦89406 saw¦89403 one of God's messengers¦89414 come¦89417 into the house and call, “Cornelius¦89423.”
\p
\v 4 Cornelius was scared and looked¦89426 intently¦89426 and asked, “What is it, master¦89435?”
\p “Your¦89441 prayers¦89440 and your¦89441 helping the poor rose up to God's notice and attention,” he said.
\v 5 “Now, send some messengers to Yoppa¦89458 to go and¦89453 find a man there named Simon¦89462 Peter¦89469.
\v 6 He's staying with Simon¦89474 the tanner¦89476 whose¦89477 house¦89480 is by the sea¦89482.”
\v 7 So¦89491 as soon as the messenger¦89494 left, Cornelius called¦89500 two¦89501 of his house¦89503 servants¦89503 and¦89505 a godly¦89507 soldier¦89506 from his bodyguard,
\v 8 and after explaining¦89512 the task to them, he sent¦89518 them off to Yoppa¦89522.
\rem /s1 Peter's Vision; Peter Visits Cornelius
\p
\v 9 The next day¦89523 as they were approaching the town, Peter¦89534 went¦89533 up onto the flat roof of the house¦89537 around midday to pray.
\v 10 But he felt hungry¦89546 and wanted something to eat, but¦89545 while it was still being prepared¦89550 he fell into a trance¦89560
\v 11 and saw the sky open up. Something like a sheet¦89573 was being¦89581 lowered down to the earth¦89584 by the four¦89575 corners¦89576
\v 12 and it held all kinds of animals and reptiles¦89598, as well as birds¦89603.
\v 13 Then¦89606 he heard a voice¦89608 saying, “Get up Peter¦89612, and slaughter these and eat¦89615 them.”
\p
\v 14 “I can't, \nd master¦89621\nd*,” Peter¦89618 responded¦89619, “because¦89622 I've never¦89623 eaten anything that's forbidden.”
\p
\v 15 But¦89630 the voice¦89631 spoke a second¦89636 time¦89636, “Don't you¦89643 be treating anything as unclean that \nd God¦89641\nd* has made clean¦89642.”
\v 16 This vision happened three¦89651 times and¦89652 then¦89648 the sheet thing was lifted back up into the sky.
\p
\v 17 Now¦89694 Peter¦89670 was still there wondering what the vision¦89676 was all about when the men¦89682 sent¦89684 by Cornelius¦89688 had tracked down the tanner's house¦89692 and¦89663 arrived outside.
\v 18 They called out to ask if Simon¦89704 Peter¦89707 was staying there.
\p
\v 19 Even as Peter¦89712 still continued¦89718 to ponder¦89714 about¦89715 the vision¦89717, the \nd spirit¦89722\nd* said¦89718, “Hey, there's three¦89727 men¦89725 here looking¦89728 for¦89728 you¦89730.
\v 20 So get up and¦89735 go downstairs to them. Believe everything they say because¦89743 I sent¦89746 them here.”
\v 21 So¦89750 he went down and¦89750 asked the men¦89756, “I'm the one you're looking¦89769 for, so tell me what you came here for.”
\p
\v 22 They answered, “We were sent by Cornelius¦89784 who's an army commander who worships \nd God¦89792\nd* and obeys his laws and has a good reputation with you Jewish people. A holy messenger¦89804 told him¦89811 to send¦89806 for you to come to his house¦89810 so they can listen¦89813 to what you have to say.”
\v 23 So¦89827 Peter invited them in to stay the night.
\rem /s1 Peter at Cornelius' House
\p The next day¦89826, Peter and¦89835 some of the believers¦89838 from Yoppa¦89842 started out with them
\v 24 and they arrived in Caesarea¦89854 the following day¦89847. Cornelius¦89857 was expecting¦89860 them and had also invited some relatives¦89865 and close¦89870 friends¦89871 to join them.
\v 25 Peter¦89881 entered the house and when they met, Cornelius¦89898 knelt down and worshipped him
\v 26 but¦89911 Peter¦89912 pulled him¦89915 up and said, “Stand up. I'm just a man like you.”
\v 27 After they greeted each other, Peter went¦89933 into the main room and¦89937 found that quite a few people had gathered there.
\v 28 Then¦89943 he told them, “You all know that us Jews are forbidden by our laws to associate with or to enter the house of a non-Jew. However, \nd God¦89966\nd* showed¦89968 me that it's not right to treat other¦89959 people as being¦89955 lesser or undesirable.
\v 29 That's why I came¦89978 without any reservations when you sent for me. But I'm still waiting to know what you all want from me?”
\p
\v 30 So¦89989 Cornelius¦89992 answered, “I was praying¦90013 in my¦90017 house¦90016 three days ago in the middle of the afternoon when I suddenly saw a man¦90020 in shining¦90026 clothes¦90025 standing in front of me
\v 31 and he said, ‘Your¦90032 prayer¦90035 has been heard, Cornelius¦90029, and \nd God¦90046\nd* has noticed your¦90032 gifts to the poor.
\v 32 Now he wants you to send¦90047 messengers to get Simon, the one called¦90055 Peter¦90056, from Yoppa¦90050 where he's living by the sea¦90069 in Simon the tanner's¦90065 house¦90061.’
\v 33 I did that straight away and you kindly came here, so now we're all here in God's \add sight\add* to find out everything that the \nd master¦90115\nd* has commanded¦90109 you to say.”

\rem /s1 Gentiles Hear the Good Message; The Gentiles Hear the Good News; Peter's Speech
\p
\v 34 So¦90118 Peter¦90119 spoke up and¦90118 said¦90124, “Honestly, I'm still just realising that \nd God¦90134\nd* doesn't favour¦90132 only certain people,\x + \xo 10:34: \xt Deu 10:17.\x*
\v 35 but he accepts¦90145 people from any nation¦90138 as long as they honour and obey him.

\v 37 And you all know the news that started in Galilee¦90182 and spread through¦90173 all Yudea¦90176 after¦90183 the time of Yohan's teaching and ministry of immersion¦90185—

\v 44 While Peter¦90339 was still¦90336 speaking¦90337, the holy \nd spirit¦90346\nd* came down onto everyone who was listening.

\v 46 as they¦90379 heard them speaking¦90382 in other languages¦90383 and¦90384 magnifying¦90385 \nd God¦90387\nd*. Then Peter¦90393 said,

\v 48 So with the authority of \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦90431\nd*, he commanded¦90419 for them to be immersed¦90432 \add in water\add*. Then they¦90435 asked¦90435 him¦90436 to stay with them for a few more days¦90441.

\rem /s1 Peter Explains His Actions; Peter's Report to the Church at Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 Soon the missionaries and¦90451 other believers¦90454 in Yudea¦90462 heard¦90444 that¦90456 non-Jews had also accepted God's message¦90471,
\v 2 but when Peter¦90481 went¦90480 to Yerushalem, the strict Jewish believers were upset with him¦90523,
\v 3 saying¦90527 that he had gone into the home of uncircumcised¦90533 pagans and¦90536 \add even\add* eaten with them.
\p
\v 4 But Peter¦90544 started explaining¦90545 from the beginning,
\v 5 “I was staying in Yoppa¦90554, and as I was praying¦90556 I saw¦90558 a vision¦90561 of an object¦90564 like a sheet¦90567 coming¦90562 down, as if it was being¦90571 let down out of the sky by its four¦90569 corners¦90570. As it came¦90577 down to me
\v 6 I looked¦90583 at it and saw¦90586 animals, even wild animals, and reptiles¦90596 and birds¦90599.
\v 7 I also heard¦90603 a voice¦90606 telling me, ‘Peter¦90613, get up and slaughter these and eat¦90616 them.’
\v 8 But I said¦90617, ‘\nd Master¦90620\nd*, I can't because¦90621 I've never¦90627 eaten anything that's forbidden.’
\v 9 But the voice¦90637 from the sky spoke again, ‘Don't you¦90650 be treating anything as unclean that \nd God¦90648\nd* has made clean¦90649.’
\v 10 This happened three¦90657 times, and¦90658 then¦90654 it was pulled¦90660 up again into the sky.
\v 11 Next minute there were three¦90669 men¦90670 at the house¦90675 where I was staying \add saying\add* that¦90677 they had been sent¦90680 from Caesarea¦90682 to fetch me,
\v 12 and the \nd spirit¦90689\nd* told me to go with them without questioning anything they said. These six¦90703 other believers¦90704 went¦90697 with me, and we¦90707 arrived at the house¦90710 of the man¦90712 \add who had sent the three\add*.
\v 13 He told us how he'd seen one \add of God's\add* messengers¦90720 standing there in his¦90724 house¦90723 and who'd told him¦90724, ‘Send \add someone\add* to Yoppa¦90732 to fetch Simon¦90736, the one called¦90738 Peter¦90739,
\v 14 and he will explain to you how you and all your¦90754 household¦90753 can be saved¦90748.’
\v 15 Then¦90756 when I started speaking¦90760 to them, the holy \nd spirit¦90765\nd* came down on them just like it had happened to us previously.
\v 16 That reminded¦90778 me of the words of the \nd master¦90784\nd* when he told us, ‘Yohan immersed people in water¦90790, but you all will be immersed in the holy \nd spirit¦90795\nd*.
\v 17 Therefore¦90799 if God gave¦90803 the same¦90801 gift¦90802 to them that he'd given to us when we'd believed¦90811 in the \nd master¦90814 Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦90816\nd*, what authority did I have to contradict God?’ ”
\p
\v 18 When the group heard¦90834 all this, they had no objections and they praised God, saying¦90844, “It seems that God has also allowed the pagans¦90849 to repent¦90853 and live.”
\s1 Many in Antioch become believers
\rem /s1 The Church at Antioch; The Church in Antioch of Syria
\p
\v 19 Over time, due to the persecution that¦90865 began with Stephen's killing, the ones who had moved away went as far as Phoenicia¦90874, Cyprus¦90876, and Antioch¦90878, but they only shared Yeshua's teaching with other Jews.
\v 20 However, some of the believers were from Cyprus and Cyrene¦90898, and when they got to Antioch¦90903 they proclaimed the good¦90911 news from the \nd master¦90913 Yeshua\nd* to the Greeks.
\v 21 \nd Yahweh¦90920\nd* caused their efforts to prosper, so a large number¦90925 of Greeks believed¦90927 and¦90916 decided to follow the master.
\p
\v 22 News about this reached the assembly¦90940 in Yerushalem, so they¦90949 sent¦90949 Barnabas¦90950 to Antioch¦90954.
\v 23 When he arrived¦90957 and saw how God's grace¦90961 \add was spreading\add*, he was elated¦90965 and encouraged them all to earnestly continue to follow the \nd master¦90976\nd*.
\v 24 Barnabas was good¦90981 man¦90979 and full of the holy \nd spirit¦90984\nd* and full of faith¦90987 \add in God\add*, and a large¦90991 number of people decided to follow Yeshua.
\p
\v 25 So¦90996 Barnabas went¦90995 to Tarsus¦91001 to look for Saul¦91009,
\v 26 and when he found¦91012 him, he brought¦91015 him back to Antioch. Then¦91024 for a whole¦91029 year¦91028 they met with the assembly¦91034 and \add regularly\add* taught a large¦91039 crowd¦91038. It was there in Antioch that the believers were first¦91044 called Christians.
\p
\v 27 In those days¦91064, some prophets¦91068 from Yerushalem went¦91065 to Antioch¦91070,
\v 28 and one of them named Agabus¦91085 when he was prompted by the \nd spirit¦91091\nd*, stood¦91079 up and predicted that¦91102 the world¦91101 would experience a severe famine¦91092 (and this happened \add later\add* during¦91106 the reign of Claudius¦91107).
\v 29 The believers decided to send¦91125 assistance to their¦91122 fellow¦91131 believers who lived in Yudea¦91130—each one according to his means—
\v 30 and so they¦91136 did, sending their contributions with Barnabas¦91143 and Saul¦91145 to take to the elders¦91140.

\v 1 Around that time¦91150, King Herod¦91154 \add Agrippa\add* used his power to mistreat¦91160 some of the believers from the assembly¦91165,
\v 2 and¦91171 he had Yacob, the brother¦91174 of Yohan, executed by the sword¦91176.
\v 3 Then¦91179 when he saw that it pleased¦91181 the Jewish religious leaders, he went on to seize Peter¦91194 during the \it Flat Bread Celebration\it*.
\v 4 After being arrested¦91204, Peter was put in prison¦91208 where he was guarded¦91215 by four squads¦91213 of four soldiers¦91214 each. After the Passover Feast, Herod planned to display Peter to the people¦91225,
\v 5 but while he was being¦91230 held in prison¦91233, those in the assembly¦91249 were earnestly¦91241 asking God¦91229 to help him.

\rem /s1 Peter Is Set Free from Prison; Peter Delivered from Prison; Peter's Miraculous Escape from Prison
\p
\v 6 Herod¦91266 planned to send for Peter later that evening, but meanwhile Peter had fallen¦91273 asleep¦91273 chained with two chains between¦91274 two soldiers¦91276. There were also prison¦91291 guards¦91280 at the door¦91287
\v 7 but one of \nd Yahweh's\nd* messengers \add suddenly appeared\add* standing by Peter and¦91292 light¦91300 radiated through the prison¦91305 cell. The messenger poked Peter in the side to wake him up, saying¦91315, “Quickly, get up!” The chains¦91323 fell off his¦91321 wrists
\v 8 and the messenger said, “Get dressed and put on your sandals¦91341,” so he did. Then¦91329 the messenger said, “Now put on your coat¦91351 and follow¦91354 me.”
\v 9 So¦91356 Peter followed¦91358 the messenger¦91371 out of the cell, not really knowing¦91362 if it was real or if he was still dreaming.
\v 10 They went past the first¦91379 guard¦91380 and then the second¦91382, and then came to the iron gate which led out of the prison into the city¦91394. The gate opened¦91397 by itself and they went out onto the street, then at the end of the street the messenger¦91415 suddenly left him.
\p
\v 11 By now Peter¦91420 was fully awake and said¦91426 to himself¦91424, “Now I know that the \nd master¦91434\nd* really did send his¦91437 messenger¦91436 to rescue¦91439 me from Herod¦91443 and from the plans of the Jewish leaders.”
\p
\v 12 Now that he realised this, he went¦91456 to Maria's¦91461 house¦91459 (the mother¦91463 of Yohan Mark¦91468) where¦91469 many believers had met to pray.
\v 13 He knocked¦91475 at the door¦91482 in the fence and¦91477 a servant¦91487 girl¦91487 named Rhoda¦91491 came out to see who it was.
\v 14 But¦91493 when she recognised¦91494 Peter's voice¦91496, she was so excited that she forgot about opening the door, but ran back inside to tell everyone that Peter was standing out there.
\v 15 They told her that she must be raving¦91525 mad, but she insisted¦91528 it was true, but they said¦91524 that it must be his¦91542 messenger¦91539.
\p
\v 16 Meanwhile Peter¦91545 continued¦91546 knocking¦91547, and when they eventually opened¦91549 the outer door, they saw¦91552 that it¦91549 was him¦91554 and they were amazed.
\v 17 But¦91582 Peter signalled them with his hand¦91563 to be quiet, and then¦91582 he explained how the \nd master¦91575\nd* had led him out of the prison¦91580, and instructed them, “Tell this to Yacob and the brothers¦91588.” Then¦91582 he left and went off to another¦91594 place¦91595.
\p
\v 18 Once daylight came, there¦91599 was pandemonium among¦91603 the soldiers¦91605 \add in the prison as they tried to figure out\add* what had happened to Peter¦91609.
\v 19 Then¦91613 when King Herod¦91611 sent for Peter and he wasn't there, the prison guards¦91621 were interrogated and then¦91613 taken away to be executed.

\s1 The death of Herod
\p
\v 20 Now King Herod was disputing with the people of Tyre¦91641 and Tsidon, and so they got together and persuaded¦91659 Blastos¦91660, a close personal servant of the king, to be their¦91674 spokesman in asking for peace¦91670 because¦91671 they were dependent on food from the king's provinces.
\p
\v 21 On the agreed day¦91686, Herod¦91688, dressed¦91689 in his royal¦91691 garments and¦91685 seated on his throne, started to address¦91697 them.
\v 22 The crowd shouted out, “This is the voice¦91710 of a \nd god¦91709\nd*, not of a man.”
\v 23 Because he didn't¦91726 attribute the honour to \nd God¦91731\nd*, one of the \nd Yahweh's\nd* messengers¦91722 immediately¦91717 struck¦91720 him down and¦91718 he stopped¦91743 breathing¦91743 as a result of a worm infestation.
\p
\v 24 Meanwhile God's message¦91746 continued to spread and¦91752 multiply¦91753.

\v 6 They travelled around the island¦91911 and when they got to Pafos¦91913, they met a Jewish man¦91916 named Bar-Jesus.\f + \fr 13:6 \ft The Greek form of his name was Elymas according to verse 8.\f* He was a sorcerer and false¦91920 prophet¦91920
\v 7 who was with Sergius Paulus the proconsul¦91934, an intelligent¦91938 man. Sergius sent for Barnabas¦91942 and Saul¦91944 because he wanted to hear God's message¦91950 from them,
\v 8 but¦91954 the sorcerer opposed them and tried to prevent Sergius¦91956 from believing.
\v 9 So then Saul¦91976 (the \add Roman\add* form of his name was Paul¦91980), filled¦91981 with the holy \nd spirit¦91982\nd* looked¦91985 intently¦91985 at Bar-Jesus

\v 13 After that, Paul\f + \fr 13:13 \ft From this point on in the text, Paul is referred to by his Roman name as his ministry is largely outside of Yisrael.

\v 14 Paul and his companions, went on from Perga¦92098 to Pisidian¦92106 Antioch¦92102, where they entered the Jewish¦92112 meeting¦92112 hall¦92112 on the Rest Day and sat¦92121 down \add with the congregation\add*.

\p
\v 16 So¦92154 Paul¦92156 stood¦92153 up and, motioning with his hand¦92160, started speaking, “Fellow Israelis and everyone who reveres¦92166 \nd God¦92168\nd*, listen¦92169 to me.
\v 17 The \nd God¦92171\nd* of the people of Yisrael chose¦92177 our¦92180 ancestors¦92179 and helped the people to prosper when they were staying in Egypt¦92193. Then later he showed his power as he led them out
\v 18 and¦92202 endured¦92209 them in the wilderness¦92213 for around forty years.
\v 19 Then having¦92215 overthrown seven¦92217 nations¦92216 in Caanan,\x + \xo 13:19: a \xt Deu 7:1; \xo b \xt Josh 14:1.\x* he passed on that land as an inheritance
\v 20 after¦92239 around 450 years¦92234.
\p “Then¦92238 he gave¦92241 them judges¦92242 through until¦92243 the time of the prophet¦92246 Shemuel \add (Samuel¦92244)\add*
\v 21 when they¦92248 requested¦92248 a king¦92249, and¦92250 \nd God¦92254\nd* gave¦92251 them Shaul \add (Saul¦92256)\add*, the son of Kish from the tribe¦92261 of Benyamin to reign for forty¦92264 years¦92263.
\v 22 After Saul was removed¦92266, God chose David to be their king¦92274—the man of whom he said, ‘I found¦92279 David the son of Jesse, a man who wants to obey me and¦92265 do everything I ask.’
\v 23 Then eventually a descendant of David arrived in Yisrael as promised¦92305—the saviour¦92311 \nd Yeshua\nd*.
\v 24 Before he arrived Yohan-the-immerser had publicly¦92314 preached to all the people¦92325 of Yisrael about being immersed¦92321 \add as a sign\add* of repentance¦92322.
\v 25 As Yohan's ministry was nearing an end, he asked, ‘Who do you suspect¦92339 I am? I'm not the messiah, but he will come after¦92347 me, and¦92328 I'm not \add even\add* worthy¦92353 to undo his sandals¦92356.’
\p
\v 26 “Men, brothers¦92361, descendants¦92363 of Abraham¦92364 and¦92365 others here who revere¦92370 \nd God¦92372\nd*, the teaching about this salvation¦92379 has been sent¦92381 to us.
\v 27 The people of Yerushalem and their \add religious\add* leaders didn't¦92394 recognise this \add Yeshua\add*, but by their judgement¦92409 of him they¦92410 fulfilled¦92410 the words of the prophets¦92401 that are read every¦92404 Rest Day.
\v 28 Despite not finding even one charge against him worthy of death¦92414, they requested¦92421 Pilate¦92424 to execute him
\v 29 and when they'd done all the things that \add the prophets\add* had written¦92441 about him, they took his body down from the post \add he'd been nailed to\add*\x + \xo 13:29: \xt Jhn 20:25.\x* and placed it in a burial chamber.

\v 32 So¦92497 now we're preaching¦92500 this good¦92500 message¦92500 to you¦92499 that what God promised¦92506 to our ancestors¦92504
\v 33 has now been fulfilled¦92513 for our¦92518 descendants, now that \nd God¦92512\nd* brought \nd Yeshua\nd* back to life just like it's written¦92538 in the second¦92540 psalm¦92536:
\q1 ‘You are my¦92543 son;
\q1 today¦92547 I have borne you.’
\m
\v 34 God brought him¦92572 back to life, and¦92570 he's never going¦92576 to return¦92577 \add to the grave\add* to decay¦92579. As God said¦92581,
\q1 ‘I will give David's faithful¦92589 devout¦92586 \add things???\add* to you¦92584 all.’
\m
\v 35 So¦92590 in another¦92594 psalm¦92594 God said,
\q1 ‘You won't¦92597 allow your¦92601 devout¦92600 one to experience decay¦92603.’
\m
\v 36 This can't be David¦92604, because¦92606 after he'd served his own generation¦92608 as \nd God¦92612\nd* led him, he indeed died and was buried with his ancestors¦92619 and his body decayed¦92623.
\v 37 On the contrary, the one who \nd God¦92628\nd* raised¦92629 from the dead never experienced decay¦92632.
\v 38 So¦92634 brothers¦92639, let it¦92635 be known¦92633 to you all that your sins¦92647 can now be forgiven¦92645 through¦92641 this \add Yeshua\add*—the law of Mosheh was never able to offer you that.
\v 39 Everyone who puts their trust in \add Yeshua\add* is able to receive a clean record.
\v 40 But keep your eyes open in case something else the prophets¦92682 wrote might come¦92675 true:

\v 41 ‘Watch¦92683 you scoffers¦92685, and be amazed and die because¦92693 I'm doing¦92697 something special during your¦92702 time.

\p
\v 42 As they¦92725 left the meeting hall after¦92732 the service, the people invited them to speak again the following Rest Day.

\q1 ‘I have chosen you to be a light¦92886 for the pagans¦92888;
\q2 You will take salvation¦92894 to the end of the earth¦92898.’
\p
\v 48 When the non-Jews heard that, they¦92904 were very happy and were praising the \nd master's¦92913\nd* message¦92910, and as many as were appointed¦92918 to \add receive\add* eternal¦92921 life¦92920 believed¦92915 \add it¦92900\add*.
\p
\v 49 So¦92924 from there, the \nd master's¦92928\nd* message¦92926 spread throughout the entire¦92931 region¦92933.
\v 50 But the Jewish religious leaders¦92948 incited¦92937 some prominent¦92944 women¦92941 from the meeting halls and some from the local city¦92950 government, and they then stirred¦92952 up persecution¦92956 against¦92957 Paul¦92959 and Barnabas¦92962 and had them expelled out of their¦92969 region¦92968.
\v 51 So Paul and Barnabas just left that place to face their own consequences, and continued on to Iconium¦92983.
\v 52 Meanwhile the believers \add back in Pisidian Antioch\add* were full of happiness and¦92991 of the holy \nd spirit¦92992\nd*.

\s1 Paul and Barnabas in Iconium
\rem /s1 In Iconium
\p
\v 1 A similar thing happened in Iconium¦92997. Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish¦93006 meeting¦93006 hall¦93006 and spoke in such a way that a lot of both Jews and Greeks¦93020 believed¦93015.
\v 2 But those Jews who didn't believe got the non-Jews emotionally stirred¦93037 up to oppose the believers¦93051.
\v 3 So¦93060 Paul and Barnabas ended up staying there for quite a while, and as they spoke boldly¦93065 for the \nd master¦93068\nd*, he himself confirmed his¦93076 grace¦93075 by enabling the two of them to be able to do miracles and amazing things.
\v 4 Nevertheless, the people¦93094 of the city¦93096 were divided¦93089—some agreeing with the \add strict\add* Jews, and others supporting the missionaries.
\p
\v 5 At one point, both the non-Jews and the strict Jews and their¦93129 leaders got worked up enough to come in order to attack them and throw¦93132 rocks¦93132 to kill them.
\v 6 However, Paul and Barnabas found out about it and escaped to the Lycaonian cities¦93139 of Lystra¦93143 and Derbe¦93145 and the surrounding¦93148 region¦93148
\v 7 and¦93150 preached¦93152 the good¦93152 message¦93152 there¦93150.
\s1 A miracle in Lystra following by a stoning
\rem /s1 Paul and Barnabas in Lystra and Derbe
\p
\v 8 In Lystra¦93175 there was a man¦93172 sitting¦93180 there who had been unable to use his¦93186 legs since birth.
\v 9 He was listening to Paul speaking¦93199, when Paul looked¦93204 straight at him¦93206 and¦93209 realised that¦93215 the man¦93192 had the faith¦93214 to be healed¦93216.
\v 10 So¦93238 in a loud¦93218 voice¦93220, Paul said¦93217, “Stand¦93230 upright on your¦93234 feet¦93233.” And the man sprang¦93244 up and¦93238 was walking¦93247 around.
\v 11 The crowd¦93251 of people who saw what Paul¦93257 had done began to shout out in Lycaonian, “These two look like men¦93268, but they're really gods¦93265 who have come down to us!”
\v 12 They called Barnabas¦93278 ‘Zeus¦93279’ and called Paul¦93282 ‘Hermas¦93283’ since¦93285 he was the main speaker.
\v 13 And the priest¦93297 of Zeus¦93300 wanted to sacrifice¦93324 with the crowds¦93320, so he brought¦93316 bulls¦93309 and¦93294 garlands¦93312 \add of flowers\add* to the city gates¦93315 from \add the temple\add* on the path to the city.
\p
\v 14 But when the missionaries Barnabas¦93330 and Paul¦93332 heard¦93325 what was going on, they tore their clothes \add in dismay\add* as they rushed¦93339 out into the crowd¦93344
\v 15 shouting, “Men, why are you doing¦93353 all these things? We are only humans¦93360 just like all of you. We were bringing you the good message about abandoning these useless¦93371 \add sacrifices\add* and turning¦93373 to the living¦93379 \nd God¦93377\nd* who made heaven¦93385 and the earth¦93388 and the sea¦93391 and everything in them.\x + \xo 14:15: \xt Exo 20:11.\x*
\v 16 In previous generations¦93402 he allowed¦93403 all the nations¦93407 to go their¦93411 own different ways¦93410,
\v 17 but he never left himself without¦93417 evidence of himself—sending good¦93423 rains¦93427 from heaven¦93424 to give you all fruitful¦93432 seasons¦93431 with food to fill \add your stomachs\add* and¦93413 happiness to fill your hearts¦93438.”
\v 18 By saying¦93443 these¦93442 things, they¦93446 were eventually just able to restrain¦93446 the people from sacrificing¦93452 to them.
\p
\v 19 But some \add strict\add* Jews came¦93465 over from \add Pisidian\add* Antioch¦93469 and Iconium¦93474 and were able to persuade¦93482 the crowds¦93486. They threw rocks at Paul¦93503 \add to kill him\add* and dragged¦93505 his body outside¦93507 the city¦93509 \add gates\add* thinking¦93510 that he was dead.
\v 20 But¦93529 as the believers were standing around him, Paul got up and went back into the city¦93528, but¦93517 he left¦93533 again with Barnabas¦93536 the next day¦93530 and went to Derbe¦93538.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas return to the sending assembly in Antioch
\rem /s1 Paul and Barnabas Return to Antioch of Syria
\p
\v 21 They preached¦93539 the good¦93539 message¦93539 in Derbe, and after giving further training¦93551 to many of them, they¦93555 returned¦93555 to Lystra¦93559 and Iconium¦93562 and Antioch¦93565.
\v 22 There they strengthened¦93566 the faith¦93577 of the believers—encouraging them to continue believing and¦93578 to expect that it's normal to endure a lot of suffering on the path to God's kingdom¦93590.
\v 23 They appointed some elders for \add each\add* assembly¦93598, then¦93594 they fasted and¦93594 prayed¦93600 for the elders—asking the \nd master¦93607\nd* that they believed¦93610 in to look after them.
\p
\v 24 After passing through¦93613 Pisidia¦93617, they¦93618 arrived at Pamfylia
\v 25 and¦93622 after teaching the \add master's\add* message¦93630 in Perga¦93627, they¦93633 went¦93633 down to \add the coastal city of\add* Attalia¦93635.
\v 26 From there¦93638, they sailed¦93639 \add back\add* to \add Syrian\add* Antioch¦93641 where the congregation had prayed for God's grace¦93646 to be with them\x + \xo 14:26: \xt 13:3.\x* for the work they had just fulfilled¦93653.
\p
\v 27 So¦93655 when they arrived¦93654, they gathered¦93657 the assembly¦93659 together¦93657 there and shared about what \nd God¦93665\nd* had done with them and how he had opened¦93674 up the door¦93677 of faith¦93678 to the non-Jews.
\v 28 Then¦93680 they¦93679 stayed on with them there for quite a while.
\c 15
\s1 The decision from the Yerushalem elders
\rem /s1 The Meeting at Jerusalem; The Council at Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 Then¦93688 some \add people\add* came \add to Antioch\add* from Yudea¦93693 and¦93688 were teaching the believers¦93696 that¦93707 according to Mosheh's teachings, you can't¦93700 be saved¦93713 unless you've been circumcised¦93702.
\v 2 This led to no end of argument and debate¦93721 between them and Paul¦93725 and Barnabas¦93728 until it was decided that the two of them and some other¦93760 believers should go to Yerushalem to ask the missionaries and the elders¦93771 there about¦93778 this issue.
\p
\v 3 So indeed¦93783 the assembly¦93788 sent¦93785 the group on their way, and as they passed through¦93789 Phoenicia¦93792 and Samaria¦93795, they described¦93797 how non-Jews had become believers and this news made the believers there¦93784 very happy.
\p
\v 4 When they arrived¦93809 in Yerushalem, they were welcomed by the assembly¦93821 and the missionaries and the elders¦93827, and they explained how \nd God¦93834\nd* had used them.
\v 5 But some of the believers¦93858 who were also members of the Pharisee party¦93857 stood up and said, “It's quite proper for them to be circumcised¦93862 and to be commanded¦93864 to keep the Jewish religious laws.”
\p
\v 6 So¦93873 the missionaries and¦93876 the elders¦93878 met separately in order to consider the matter¦93882 further.
\v 7 After a lot of debate¦93887, Peter¦93918 stood¦93914 up and said, “Men, brothers¦93924, all of you here know that some time back, \nd God¦93936\nd* chose¦93934 me to be a mouthpiece¦93942 so that the non-Jews could hear the good message and believe¦93952.
\v 8 And \nd God¦93958\nd* who knows even people's inner thoughts, gave them the same holy \nd spirit¦93968\nd* that he gave us,
\v 9 and when he purified¦93984 their¦93987 minds by the faith¦93983, he didn't do anything different for them than he did for us.
\v 10 So¦93989 why are you¦93991 all provoking \nd God¦93993\nd* by putting a load on the shoulders of these believers that neither¦94002 we¦94007, nor our¦94005 ancestors¦94004, were ever able to bear?
\v 11 But we¦94018 ourselves have believed¦94018 thanks to the grace¦94013 of \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd master¦94015\nd*, and they can be saved¦94020 in just the same way.”
\p
\v 12 The whole group sat in silence¦94034, and then¦94036 they listened to Barnabas¦94042 and Paul¦94045 as they described everything that \nd God¦94052\nd* had done among¦94056 the non-Jews through them, including miracles and amazing things.
\v 13 Then¦94062 while they were still silent¦94064, Yacob responded, “Men, brothers¦94072, listen¦94073 to me.
\v 14 Simon Peter has told us how \nd God¦94080\nd* first¦94078 intervened in order to select a people¦94086 for himself from among the non-Jews.
\v 15 And this actually agrees¦94094 with the message¦94097 that the prophets¦94099 recorded,
\q1
\v 16 ‘After¦94102 these¦94104 things have happened I will return¦94106,
\q1 and I will rebuild the worship tent from David's time that¦94113 has collapsed,
\q1 Although it was overturned¦94117, I will rebuild and restore¦94123 it,
\q1
\v 17 so that the remaining people¦94131 will want to find the master,
\q1 and also the non-Jews who cried out to me.
\q1 \nd Yahweh¦94134\nd* who's doing¦94150 these¦94152 things is saying¦94147 this,
\q1
\v 18 and planned it this way from eternity¦94157.’
\p
\v 19 Because of this, my ruling is not to be troubling¦94172 the non-Jews who are turning¦94177 back to \nd God¦94180\nd*,
\v 20 but to write¦94182 to them to keep away from anything polluted¦94188 by idols¦94190, from sexual¦94193 immorality¦94193, and from strangled¦94196 animals¦94196 and \add eating or drinking\add* blood¦94199.
\v 21 Mosheh's writings have been preached in every city¦94216 and are read in \add our\add* meeting¦94228 halls¦94228 on every Rest Day.
\s1 The letter is carried to Antioch
\rem /s1 The Letter to the Gentile Believers; The Council's Letter to Gentile Believers
\p
\v 22 So the missionaries and elders¦94240 with all the assembly¦94244 decided to choose some men to accompany Paul¦94254 and Barnabas¦94256 to Antioch¦94251, so they chose¦94245 Yudas¦94257 (nicknamed Barsabbas¦94261) and Silas¦94264 who were leaders among¦94268 the believers¦94270,
\v 23 This is what they wrote¦94271: This letter is from the missionaries and elders¦94284, your brothers \add here in Yerushalem\add* to our non-Jewish fellow believers¦94287 in Antioch¦94291 and Syria¦94294 and Cilicia¦94297.
\v 24 Since¦94304 we heard¦94307 that some people who weren't sent by us came from here and disturbed¦94315 you all with their upsetting¦94318 messages¦94317,
\v 25 we unanimously agreed to select some men¦94337 to accompany our¦94345 dear \add friends\add* Barnabas¦94346 and¦94347 Paul¦94348 back.
\v 26 These are men¦94349 who have dedicated their¦94356 lives¦94354 to our¦94362 \nd master¦94361\nd*, \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦94364\nd*.
\v 27 So¦94369 we've sent¦94368 Yudas¦94370 and Silas¦94372 and they'll confirm in person what we are writing.
\v 28 It seemed right to the holy \nd spirit¦94385\nd* and¦94389 to us to not burden¦94397 you¦94396 all with anything more than the following commands:
\v 29 you all must keep away from anything sacrificed¦94404 to idols, from \add eating or drinking\add* blood¦94406 or strangled¦94409 animals¦94409, and from sexual¦94411 immorality¦94411. You will do well if you avoid these things. Farewell.
\p
\v 30 So¦94436 they were sent¦94437 off and when they arrived at Antioch¦94444, they gathered¦94446 the believers and handed¦94449 across the letter¦94451,
\v 31 and¦94453 when they read it¦94452, they were very happy with the encouraging contents.
\p
\v 32 Yudas¦94458 and Barnabas¦94462 were both prophets¦94465, and said a lot to encourage them and strengthen¦94479 \add their faith\add*.
\v 33 After they'd stayed there¦94483 for a while, the believers¦94489 sent them home carrying greetings from them to the assembly \add back in Yerushalem\add*.
\p
\v 34 ◘
\v 35 But Paul¦94510 and Barnabas¦94513 stayed on there in Antioch¦94516, teaching¦94517 them and preaching¦94519 the good message along with many others¦94523.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas go separate ways
\rem /s1 Paul and Barnabas Separate; Disagreement Between Paul and Barnabas
\p
\v 36 After a few days¦94532, Paul¦94538 suggested to Barnabas¦94537, “Let's go back and visit¦94542 the believers¦94544 in each city¦94549 where we proclaimed¦94555 the \nd master's¦94559\nd* message¦94557, and see how they're doing.”
\v 37 Barnabas¦94562 agreed and¦94563 wanted to take¦94567 Yohan¦94571 Mark¦94575 along¦94567 with them as well,
\v 38 but¦94577 Paul¦94576 didn't¦94590 want to take him because he had left them in Pamfylia¦94588 instead of continuing with them in their work.
\v 39 And so it turned into such a disagreement that the two of them each went their different ways. Barnabas¦94619 took Yohan Mark¦94624 with him and¦94618 sailed to Cyprus¦94629
\v 40 while Paul¦94630 chose¦94633 Silas¦94634 and they left¦94635 after being entrusted to the \nd master's¦94640\nd* grace¦94638 by the believers¦94645.
\v 41 They went through¦94646 Syria¦94651 and¦94653 Cilicia¦94656, strengthening¦94658 the assemblies¦94660 there.
\c 16
\s1 Paul and Silas also take Timothy with them
\rem /s1 Paul's Second Missionary Journey; Timothy Joins Paul and Silas; Timothy Goes with Paul and Silas
\p
\v 1 Then¦94668 Paul went to Derbe¦94675 and¦94676 then¦94668 on to Lystra¦94678 where a believer named Timothy¦94687 lived. His mother was a Jewish believer, but¦94694 his father¦94693 was Greek¦94695.
\v 2 The believers¦94705 in Lystra¦94701 and¦94702 Iconium¦94703 spoke well of Timothy
\v 3 and Paul¦94709 wanted¦94707 him to accompany them on his trip so he circumcised¦94717 him \add in advance\add* because¦94720 of the Jews in that region—everyone knew that his father¦94737 was a Greek¦94734.
\v 4 As they passed through¦94746 various towns, they explained the decision of the missionaries and¦94745 elders¦94775 in Yerushalem about which commands they must adhere to.
\v 5 So¦94782 the assemblies¦94783 were strengthened¦94784 in this way and¦94787 their numbers¦94790 were increasing each day¦94792.

\p
\v 6 From there, they¦94794 travelled through¦94794 Phrygia¦94797 and¦94798 the Galatia¦94800 region¦94801, after the holy \nd spirit¦94806\nd* prevented them from proclaiming the message¦94810 in Asia¦94815 \add Minor\add*.
\v 7 When they got to Mysia¦94821, they planned to go on into Bithynia¦94827, but \nd Yeshua's spirit¦94835\nd* didn't¦94831 let them,
\v 8 so after leaving Mysia¦94842 they¦94844 went¦94844 to Troas¦94846.
\v 9 During the night¦94853, Paul¦94856 had a vision¦94849 of a Macedonian man¦94859 standing there and imploring¦94868 him¦94869, “Come on to Macedonia¦94860 and help¦94877 us here.”
\v 10 So¦94881 as a result of the vision¦94885, we¦94892 decided to go straight to Macedonia¦94896, concluding¦94897 that \nd God¦94902\nd* had called¦94899 us to share the good message with them.

\rem /s1 In Philippi: the Conversion of Lydia; Lydia of Philippi Believes in Jesus; Lydia's Conversion in Philippi
\p
\v 11 From Troas¦94919 we¦94920 sailed directly to Samothrace¦94922, and¦94925 then on to Neapolis the following¦94927 day¦94924.
\v 12 From there¦94933 we continued on to Philippi¦94937 which¦94938 is a \add Roman\add* colony¦94948 and¦94951 the capital city of the Macedonia¦94946 district¦94944 where we stayed for several days.
\v 13 On the Rest Days, we went¦94966 \add down\add* to the river¦94973 outside¦94967 the \add city\add* gate¦94969 where¦94974 we thought people might be praying, and¦94962 we spoke to the women¦94989 who had met there.
\v 14 One of them was Lydia from Thyatira¦94998 who was a seller¦94995 of purple goods\f + \fr 16:14 \ft It's possible that Lydia dyed fabric and sold it, or that she actually made and sold the purple dye itself.\f* and although she already worshipped¦94999 \nd God¦95002\nd*, the \nd master¦95007\nd* opened¦95008 her¦95009 mind¦95010 and she readily accepted what Paul¦95016 was saying.
\v 15 So then Lydia and her¦95024 household were all \add ceremonially\add* immersed¦95019, and then she requested, “If you all consider me to be faithful¦95030 to the \nd master¦95033\nd*, come¦95035 and stay at my¦95041 place.” So she persuaded us.
\s1 Paul and Silas get thrown into prison
\rem /s1 In Prison at Philippi; Paul and Silas in Prison
\p
\v 16 One time as we were walking to the prayer¦95054 meeting, we met a female slave who was possessed by a spirit¦95059 that enabled her to tell fortunes¦95076, and¦95049 thanks to that, to earn a lot of money for her masters¦95072.
\v 17 She walked along behind us and shouted out, “These¦95089 men¦95091 are slaves¦95092 of the highest¦95096 \nd god¦95094\nd* and they will be telling you¦95101 all how to be saved.”
\v 18 After she'd done this for several days¦95110, Paul¦95115 was so frustrated that he turned¦95117 around and¦95106 spoke to the spirit¦95119 \add in her\add*, “I command¦95123 you by the authority of \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦95129\nd* to leave her.”
\p
\v 19 But when her¦95152 masters¦95151 realised that their¦95162 profitable business¦95161 was about to come to an end, they¦95173 grabbed Paul¦95169 and Silas¦95172 and dragged¦95173 them to the authorities at the marketplace¦95176.
\v 20 They brought¦95181 them forward¦95181 to face the magistrates and¦95180 said¦95186, “These¦95187 Jews are disturbing¦95190 \add the peace\add* in our¦95192 city¦95194
\v 21 and¦95197 teaching behaviour that we as Romans can neither accept¦95207 nor practice¦95211.”
\v 22 An \add angry\add* crowd¦95219 gathered around and the magistrates ordered for Paul and Silas to have their¦95229 robes¦95231 torn off and then¦95215 to be beaten with rods.
\v 23 They were severely beaten and¦95236 then¦95236 thrown¦95240 into prison where the officer was commanded¦95243 to keep them secure¦95248.
\v 24 Because of that, he threw them into the inner¦95264 cell and locked their¦95267 feet¦95268 in stocks¦95277.
\p
\v 25 Around midnight¦95282 Paul¦95287 and Silas¦95290 were praying¦95291 and singing¦95292 praises to \nd God¦95294\nd*, and the other prisoners¦95301 were listening¦95295 to them.
\v 26 Suddenly there was a strong earthquake¦95304 that shook even the foundations¦95310 of the prison, and immediately¦95316 all the prison doors¦95318 opened¦95313 up and the chains of all the prisoners came loose.
\v 27 The prison officer woke up, and¦95328 when he saw that all the prison doors¦95336 were open, he drew his sword¦95343 to take his own life as he figured that all the prisoners must have escaped¦95349.
\v 28 But Paul¦95359 shouted out, “Don't harm yourself¦95363! We're all still here!”
\p
\v 29 The officer called for torches, then¦95372 rushed¦95375 in and knelt down trembling¦95377 in front of Paul¦95385 and Silas¦95388.
\v 30 Then¦95389 he escorted them out and¦95389 asked, “Masters¦95402, what do I need to do to be saved¦95408?”
\p
\v 31 “Believe¦95412 in the \nd master¦95416 Yeshua¦95417\nd*,” they replied, “then¦95410 you and¦95410 your¦95425 household¦95424 can all be saved¦95420.”
\v 32 Then¦95426 they explained the message¦95430 about the \nd master¦95433\nd* to him and¦95426 all those in his¦95441 household¦95440.
\v 33 Even though it was still the middle of the night¦95451, he sponged their¦95455 wounds¦95456, and then¦95442 him and his¦95467 household were all immersed¦95459 straight away.
\v 34 He took Paul and Silas up into his house¦95479 and gave them a meal, and his whole household were happy because they now believed¦95492 in \nd God¦95496\nd*.
\p
\v 35 The next day¦95498 the magistrates sent¦95502 officials¦95505 to tell the jailer to release Paul and¦95499 Silas.
\p
\v 36 So¦95534 the officer told Paul¦95545, “The magistrates \add sent these officials\add* to order¦95552 that you two be released.”
\p
\v 37 But Paul¦95564 responded, “You mean that after publicly¦95571 beating us Roman men¦95573 without a trial, they threw us into prison¦95580 and now they want to just quietly release us.”
\p
\v 38 So¦95595 the officials¦95600 reported¦95593 this back to the magistrates, and they were quite afraid¦95614 when they heard¦95617 that Paul and Silas were Roman \add citizens\add*.
\v 39 So¦95622 now they came to the prison in person, and appealed¦95631 to them, and escorting them out of prison themselves, asked them to please leave the city¦95654.
\v 40 So¦95665 after Paul and Silas left the prison¦95669, they went¦95671 to see Lydia¦95675 and after encouraging the believers¦95680 there, they left.

\s1 Jason gets in trouble in Thessalonica
\rem /s1 Paul Preaches in Thessalonica; The Uproar in Thessalonica
\p
\v 1 After travelling¦95691 through¦95691 Amphipolis¦95695 and Apollonia¦95698, Paul and Silas went¦95699 to Thessalonica¦95706 where¦95707 there was a Jewish¦95710 meeting¦95710 hall¦95710.
\v 2 Paul's custom was to attend at the local meeting hall on the Rest Day, so he did that, and¦95715 for three weekends in a row he discussed¦95729 the scriptures¦95736 with them,
\v 3 showing them how that it¦95743 \add had been written\add* that the messiah would suffer¦95744 and be killed and come back to life, and then explaining, “This \nd Yeshua\nd* that I've been telling you¦95761 about is the messiah.”
\v 4 Some of them were persuaded¦95766 and joined¦95768 with Paul¦95770 and Silas¦95773, along with a big group of godly Greeks¦95781 and quite a few prominent women¦95786.
\p
\v 5 But some of the other Jews were envious \add of them\add*, and enlisted some of the troublemakers from the marketplaces¦95806 to form a mob. They stirred up all the people, and looking¦95824 for¦95824 Paul and Silas so they could bring¦95827 them out, arrived at the house¦95822 of a man named Jason.
\v 6 But¦95834 when they realised that Paul and Silas weren't there, they dragged¦95836 Jason and some other believers¦95844 off to the city¦95847 leaders, shouting¦95848, “Those two men who've gone around upsetting¦95856 the whole world¦95855 have now come here as well
\v 7 and Jason has welcomed¦95863 them \add into his house\add*. They rebel against Caesar's decrees¦95870 and claim that \nd Yeshua\nd* is a rival king¦95873.”
\v 8 They stirred up the crowd¦95885 and¦95887 the city¦95891 leaders with these¦95894 accusations,
\v 9 so the leaders collected a heavy fine from Jason¦95901 and the others, and then¦95895 released them.
\s1 Many new believers in Berea
\rem /s1 Paul and Silas in Berea; Paul and Silas in Beroea
\p
\v 10 So¦95908 the believers¦95909 immediately¦95910 sent¦95915 Paul¦95918 and¦95919 Silas¦95921 off during the night¦95914 to go to Berea. In Berea they also attended at the Jewish¦95929 meeting¦95929 hall¦95929
\v 11 and this group were more upper-class than the congregation in Thessalonica¦95942. They eagerly accepted the message¦95946 and examined¦95953 the scriptures¦95955 every¦95951 day¦95952 to check if what was being taught matched what was written there.
\v 12 Because it did, many of the people believed¦95969 including quite a few of the prominent¦95981 Greeks.
\v 13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica¦95997 found out that God's message¦96009 was also being proclaimed¦96004 by Paul¦96007 there¦96021 in Berea¦96003, they¦96018 soon turned up to agitate¦96022 and¦96023 stir the crowds¦96026.
\v 14 So¦96030 the believers¦96038 immediately¦96029 sent¦96036 Paul¦96035 off to the coast, but Silas¦96054 and¦96030 Timothy¦96057 both stayed.
\v 15 The ones guiding Paul¦96063 took him to Athens¦96067 before they headed back with his instructions for Silas¦96087 and Timothy¦96090 to come¦96097 and join him again as soon as possible.
\s1 People of Athens like new ideas
\rem /s1 Paul in Athens; Paul Preaches in Athens
\p
\v 16 While Paul¦96110 stayed in Athens¦96104 waiting for them, he was upset in his¦96114 spirit¦96113 as he observed¦96118 how idolatrous¦96119 the people were.
\v 17 So¦96125 while he stayed busy having discussions¦96123 with the Jews and other worshippers¦96133 from the meeting¦96128 hall¦96128, he also spent time every¦96140 day¦96141 with anyone¦96124 who just happened¦96144 to be around in the marketplace¦96138.
\v 18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers¦96153 enjoyed discussing things with him, but¦96170 others just mocked him, “What does this babbler¦96165 want to talk about now?”
\p But others said, “Seems that he's talking¦96159 about strange¦96171 demons¦96172,” because¦96176 he was preaching¦96183 the good¦96183 message¦96183 about \nd Yeshua\nd* and coming back to life.
\v 19 So they grabbed him and brought¦96199 him to the Aries¦96197 Hill \add where the council sat\add* and asked, “Are we allowed to know¦96205 what this new teaching¦96216 that¦96210 you're bringing is about?
\v 20 It seems that you¦96221 have some surprising¦96217 ideas for our¦96228 ears¦96227, so we¦96229 want to hear what it's all about.”
\v 21 (Everyone¦96249 in Athens and¦96242 even visitors¦96244 often took the opportunity¦96251 either to explain or to listen to any new things.)
\p
\v 22 So¦96261 Paul¦96263 stood¦96260 up in the middle of the gathering on the hill and¦96261 spoke, “Men of Athens, I've noticed how you¦96277 all are very religious,
\v 23 because¦96280 as I was looking around and observing¦96283 your¦96287 objects¦96286 of worship, I even discovered an altar¦96290 that was inscribed¦96295, ‘To the unknown¦96296 \nd god¦96297\nd*.’ So¦96300 without knowing¦96301 it, you already worship this \nd God¦96297\nd* that I'm going to tell you about.
\v 24 This \nd God¦96310\nd* who created the earth and everything in it¦96319 is \nd Yahweh¦96326\nd* who's over heaven¦96321 and earth. He doesn't live in man-made temples¦96330
\v 25 nor can he be repaired by any human¦96338 hands¦96337 and he doesn't need to be fed. \add On the contrary\add*, he's the one who gives life¦96352 and breath¦96354 and who gives us everything that we need.
\v 26 From one man he made every¦96364 nationality¦96365 that lives across all the earth¦96376 and designated¦96377 their boundaries¦96384 and their futures.
\v 27 He made them so that they would try to discover \nd God¦96393\nd*, and if they did search for him they might find him as he's not far from any one of us
\v 28 because¦96423
\q1 ‘We live in him and are moved¦96426 by him and exist through him.’
\m Even some of your own poets¦96441 wrote,
\q1 ‘We are all descended¦96447 from just one.’
\m
\v 29 So¦96450 since we are God's offspring, we shouldn't¦96454 be putting gold¦96458 or silver¦96462 or stone¦96464 craftsmanship¦96466 in the same class as the divine¦96472.
\v 30 In fact \nd God¦96485\nd* overlooked¦96483 times¦96478 of such ignorance¦96480 in the past, but now he's informing everyone¦96496 and requiring them to repent¦96497
\v 31 because he's set a date for when he's going¦96505 to be fairly judging¦96506 the world¦96509. He's already appointed the judge who everyone can have faith¦96517 in because he brought¦96518 him back to life from the dead¦96524.
\p
\v 32 When they heard¦96525 about a dead¦96528 person coming back to life, some started mocking¦96531 but others¦96533 said¦96534, “We'd like to hear¦96535 more about this from you¦96536 another time.”
\v 33 So Paul¦96545 left¦96546 at that stage
\v 34 but¦96551 some people joined¦96553 with him¦96555 and believed¦96556, including Dionysius¦96560 who was a council member, a woman¦96566 named Damaris¦96568, and others¦96570 as well.

\s1 Paul resides in Corinth for some time
\rem /s1 Paul in Corinth; Paul Meets Priscilla and Aquila in Corinth
\p
\v 1 After¦96575 this, Paul left Athens¦96584 and travelled to Corinth¦96587.
\v 2 There he came across a Jew named Aquila¦96593 who had been born in Pontus but who had recently¦96597 moved from Italy¦96602 along with his¦96606 wife¦96605 Priscilla¦96604 because¦96607 \add Emperor\add* Claudius¦96611 had ordered all Jews to leave Rome¦96620. So¦96588 Paul approached¦96627 them,
\v 3 and since they worked in the same¦96635 trade¦96635, he ended up staying with them and they worked together in their craft¦96650 of tent-making.
\v 4 On every¦96662 Rest Day, Paul debated in the Jewish¦96659 meeting¦96659 hall¦96659, and was persuading¦96673 both Jews and Greeks¦96681.
\p
\v 5 However when Silas¦96692 and¦96693 Timothy¦96695 arrived from Macedonia¦96688, Paul¦96701 was able to devote his full time to the message¦96698—demonstrating to the Jews that \nd Yeshua\nd* is the \add promised\add* \nd messiah¦96707\nd*.
\v 6 But¦96720 when they opposed¦96717 \add the message\add* and made false accusations, he \add publicly\add* brushed \add the dust\add* off his clothes¦96728\f + \fr 18:6 \ft In the culture, this was a demonstration that you're not responsible for their decision(s).\f* and said¦96730, “Your¦96735 future deaths are your own problem. I'm innocent \add of your guilt.\add* From now on, I'll going¦96749 to the non-Jews.”
\v 7 So¦96751 Paul left there¦96756, and went¦96757 to stay at the house of a man named Titos Justus who worshipped¦96769 \nd God¦96771\nd* and whose house was next-door to the meeting¦96778 hall¦96778.
\v 8 Krispo¦96779 the meeting¦96783 hall¦96783 leader¦96783 and all his¦96795 household¦96794 decided to follow the \nd master¦96789\nd*, and many of the Corinthians¦96799 believed¦96785 after they heard \add the message\add* and were immersed¦96803.
\p
\v 9 Then¦96816 the \nd master¦96818\nd* spoke to Paul¦96827 one night¦96820 in a vision¦96822, “Don't be afraid and¦96834 stay silent¦96836, but¦96832 keep¦96836 speaking¦96833 out
\v 10 because I am with you and no one can mistreat¦96848 you here because there¦96852 are many of my people¦96851 in this city¦96857.”
\v 11 So Paul stayed on for eighteen months¦96869, teaching¦96871 God's message¦96876 to the people there.
\p
\v 12 Then at the time when Gallio¦96879 was the proconsul¦96883 of Achaia¦96886, the Jews united against Paul¦96898 and¦96900 brought a case to the tribunal¦96909 against him¦96905
\v 13 saying¦96912, “This man¦96919 is going against the law by persuading¦96918 people¦96921 to be worshipping¦96922 \add his\add* \nd God¦96924\nd*.”
\p
\v 14 But as Paul¦96928 opened his mouth¦96931 to speak, Gallio¦96934 said¦96932 to the Jews, “I would have accepted this charge if it¦96942 was a serious wrong¦96944 or evil¦96948 crime¦96947 and would have listened to you¦96956 Jews.
\v 15 However, since it's a question¦96961 about¦96964 a message¦96965 and names¦96967 and your own law, you all can see to it yourselves¦96974 because I don't¦96979 want to get involved in judging things like that¦96970.”
\v 16 So¦96983 he sent them away from the tribunal¦96989,
\v 17 but¦97004 they¦97000 grabbed Sosthenes¦96997, the leader¦96999 from the meeting¦96999 hall¦96999, and¦96992 beat him up right there in front of the tribunal¦97003. But¦96992 Gallio¦97009 took action to stop them.

\p
\v 18 Paul¦97014 stayed on for quite a few days¦97018 after that, then¦97013 he farewelled the believers¦97021 and went to Cenchrea¦97038 where he had his hair cut as was the custom for someone making a vow. Then¦97013 taking Priscilla¦97031 and Aquila¦97033 with him, he sailed towards Syria¦97027.
\v 19 When they arrived¦97045 at Ephesus¦97050, he left the other two there while he went into the Jewish¦97067 meeting¦97067 hall¦97067 and¦97048 had a discussion¦97070 with the Jews there.
\v 20 They asked him to remain¦97081 longer, but he¦97085 turned them down
\v 21 although as he gave his farewells, he said¦97091, “I'll come back here again if \nd God¦97110\nd* wills it,” then he sailed on from Ephesus¦97118.
\p
\v 22 When he landed at Caesarea¦97122, he went¦97129 \add to Yerushalem\add* and¦97119 greeted¦97126 the assembly¦97128 there before continuing on to Antioch¦97131.
\v 23 He stayed there for some time¦97134 before travelling through the regions¦97142 of Galatia¦97141 and¦97143 Frygia strengthening¦97147 \add the faith of\add* the believers \add through his teaching\add*.
\s1 Apollos teaches in Ephesus and Corinth
\rem /s1 Ministry of Apollos; Apollos Instructed at Ephesus; Apollos in Ephesus and Corinth
\p
\v 24 Meanwhile a Jewish man¦97162 named Apollos¦97155 (who had been born in \add the city of\add* Alexandria¦97158) arrived¦97164 in Ephesus¦97166. He knew the \add Hebrew\add* scriptures¦97171 well
\v 25 and had been taught¦97194 about the \nd master's¦97184\nd* way¦97181. Being a very enthusiastic person, he started teaching¦97194 about \nd Yeshua\nd*, even though he didn't know about being¦97186 filled with the spirit¦97188.\x + \xo 18:25: \xt 2:1-4.\x*
\v 26 So¦97207 Apollos started speaking¦97209 out boldly¦97209 in the Jewish¦97212 meeting¦97212 hall¦97212. Priscilla¦97218 and Aquila¦97221 listened to him, then¦97207 asked to speak with him privately and explained¦97229 God's way¦97231 more accurately.
\v 27 Now Apollos wanted to go to Achaia¦97274, so the believers encouraged¦97276 him and¦97255 sent a letter ahead of him to tell the believers there to welcome¦97282 him, so when he arrived¦97285 there, he was able to contribute¦97288 a lot to those who through God's grace¦97298 had also become believers.
\v 28 Apollos was \add also\add* able to thoroughly¦97303 refute¦97303 the arguments of the Jews and used the scriptures¦97310 to show that \nd Yeshua\nd* is the \nd messiah¦97313\nd*.
\c 19
\s1 Many filled with the spirit in Ephesus
\rem /s1 Paul's Third Missionary Journey; Paul in Ephesus
\p
\v 1 So¦97320 then¦97320 while Apollos¦97325 was at Corinth¦97329, Paul¦97330 travelled through¦97348 the interior regions before arriving at Ephesus¦97358. He found some followers there,
\v 2 and¦97377 asked them if they had received¦97374 the holy spirit when they had \add first\add* believed¦97375 \add in Yeshua\add*.
\p They replied, “We hadn't even heard¦97390 that there's¦97389 a holy spirit.”
\p
\v 3 “So¦97405 then¦97405 what were you¦97403 immersed¦97403 into?” asked Paul.
\p “With Yohan's immersion¦97411,” they¦97404 answered.
\p
\v 4 Then¦97413 Paul¦97415 said, “Yohan immersed people¦97422 \add in water\add* with an immersion¦97419 that went with repentance¦97420 \add from their sins\add*, but he told them to believe in the one who would follow him, that is to believe in \nd Yeshua\nd*.”
\p
\v 5 When the followers heard¦97437 this, they¦97440 were immersed¦97440 \add in water again, this time proclaiming their faith\add* in \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd master¦97445\nd*.
\v 6 Then¦97452 Paul¦97458 placed his hands¦97460 on them \add and prayed\add* and the holy \nd spirit¦97465\nd* came¦97463 \add down\add* onto them and they started speaking in other languages¦97475 and speaking messages from God.
\v 7 There were about¦97483 twelve¦97484 men¦97482 in the group.
\rem /s1 Paul Ministers in Ephesus
\p
\v 8 So¦97486 Paul started going to the Jewish¦97491 meeting¦97491 hall¦97491 and for the next three¦97498 months¦97497 he boldly¦97495 discussed¦97499 and persuaded¦97501 them about God's kingdom¦97505.
\v 9 But as some of them refused to believe and became hardened¦97514 against his teaching and started telling everyone¦97535 that the \add Yeshua\add* way¦97519 was evil¦97517, Paul stopped teaching in the meeting hall and taught the followers at Turannos' school¦97540 instead.
\v 10 This went on for two¦97553 years¦97552 to the point that everyone in Asia¦97564 \add Minor\add*, whether Jews or Greeks¦97579, heard the message¦97570 about Yeshua.
\s1 The power of the master's message
\rem /s1 The Sons of Sceva
\p
\v 11 And \nd God¦97589\nd* was doing¦97590 incredible miracles¦97581 through Paul¦97594
\v 12 such that even if handkerchiefs¦97606 or aprons¦97609 that had touched his¦97605 skin were placed on top of any person who was sick or troubled with demons, then they would recover and the evil¦97620 spirits¦97618 would leave them.
\v 13 But some of the Jewish exorcists¦97635 going¦97632 around¦97632 attempted¦97625 to use the name¦97645 of Yeshua to drive out evil¦97643 spirits¦97641 by telling them, “I am imploring¦97652 you¦97653 all by Yeshua that Paul¦97660 preaches about.”
\v 14 Seven sons¦97677 of the Jewish chief¦97674 priest¦97674, Sceva¦97670 were doing¦97682 this.
\p
\v 15 But the evil¦97719 spirit¦97717 would answer¦97713 them saying, “I know \nd Yeshua\nd* and¦97726 I recognise¦97729 Paul¦97728, but¦97731 who are you¦97730?”
\p
\v 16 Then¦97734 the man¦97742 who had the evil¦97751 spirit¦97749 would jump on them and beat them up so they'd end up escaping¦97766 out of the house¦97770 naked¦97763 and wounded¦97765.
\v 17 When everyone in Ephesus¦97784 heard about this, both Jews and Greeks¦97780 were frightened, and the name¦97797 of \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd master¦97799\nd* was being¦97795 honoured.
\v 18 Many of the people who believed¦97805 \add in Yeshua\add* came and confessed¦97808 \add their¦97813 sins\add* and wrong practices¦97812.
\v 19 Lots of the people who'd practiced¦97821 magic¦97820 brought¦97822 their¦97824 scrolls¦97825 and¦97815 burnt them in front of the others. When the values of all of these were added up, it was \add huge\add*—worth around 50,000 silver¦97836 \add coins\add*.
\v 20 So that was how the \nd master's¦97849\nd* message¦97852 had a powerful¦97841 effect and¦97854 won over many people.

\p
\v 21 After all of this, Paul¦97865 decided in his \nd spirit¦97869\nd* that he would need to travel through¦97870 Macedonia¦97873 and¦97860 Achaia¦97876 enroute to Yerushalem, saying, “After I've been there¦97888 a while, I will also need to go to Rome¦97892.”
\v 22 He sent¦97895 two¦97900 of his workers, Timothy¦97907 and¦97896 Eratos, to Macedonia¦97899 while he stayed on a bit longer in Asia¦97918 \add Minor\add*.
\rem /s1 The Riot in Ephesus
\p
\v 23 But¦97921 while he was still there, a major disturbance¦97926 hit the Yeshua followers.
\v 24 A silversmith¦97937 named Demetrius¦97932 made \add little¦97951\add* silver¦97941 shrines of Artemis¦97943 and this business¦97952 brought a tidy profit to the local craftsmen¦97948.
\v 25 Demetrius gathered all the workers¦97963 together¦97955 and told them, “Men, you¦97971 all know that our prosperity¦97978 comes from this business¦97976 of ours.
\v 26 But¦97982 you've seen yourselves and heard from others that not only Ephesus¦97993, but almost¦97996 our entire¦97983 \add province of\add* Asia¦97999 \add Minor\add* has become¦98019 persuaded¦98005 by this Paul¦98001 fellow, and now the crowds¦98009 are saying¦98010 that what we make are not \add real\add* gods¦98015.
\v 27 However it's not only us and our trade¦98030 that is coming into disrepute¦98034, but¦98023 the temple¦98044 of the great goddess¦98041 Artemis is considered to be useless. This could result in a loss of power for the great Artemis that all of Asia¦98066 \add Minor\add* and the inhabited¦98069 world¦98069 have been worshipping¦98070.”
\p
\v 28 When the gathering heard¦98072 this, they¦98083 became very angry and¦98075 yelled out, “Artemis¦98087 of the Ephesians is great!”
\v 29 Then¦98089 the \add whole\add* city¦98094 was filled¦98090 with confusion¦98097 and the people rushed¦98099 to the theatre¦98105 and grabbed Gaius¦98108 and Aristarchus¦98110 from Macedonia¦98111—travelling¦98113 companions¦98113 of Paul's¦98115.
\v 30 Now Paul¦98117 wanted to go there and speak to the crowd, but¦98119 the believers wouldn't let him¦98129 go.
\v 31 Also some of the leaders from Asia \add Minor\add* who were friendly¦98141 towards him, sent¦98142 messengers to him to implore¦98145 him not to go to the theatre¦98152.
\v 32 Some of the people gathered there were yelling out something, but overall it was just confusion, and¦98166 the majority of the people couldn't even tell you the reason why they¦98174 were there.
\v 33 Some people in the crowd¦98178 selected Alexander¦98182 the Jew and¦98176 sent him forward¦98183 to speak, so he motioned with his hand¦98195 ready to explain the situation to the people.
\v 34 But as soon as they recognised¦98202 that he was a Jew, people started yelling, “Artemis¦98222 of the Ephesians is great,” and this continued for over two¦98217 hours¦98216.
\p
\v 35 Eventually the city¦98253 administrator was able to calm the crowd¦98234 and tell them, “Men, fellow Ephesians, what person from around here doesn't know that it's Ephesus that's the temple¦98254 keeper¦98254 of the great¦98259 Artemis¦98261 and of this image¦98264 that fell down from Zeus?
\v 36 Since all of this is unquestionable¦98265, it¦98271 makes sense for everyone to calm down and¦98275 not do anything reckless¦98277.
\v 37 These men¦98282 that you¦98279 presented here haven't stolen anything from the temple¦98287, nor have they slandered¦98290 our¦98294 goddess¦98292.
\v 38 So if Demetrius¦98299 and the silver craftsmen¦98307 with him¦98306 have a case against anyone¦98311, they should¦98319 bring it to the courts¦98314 and the proconsuls¦98317 and register the charges.
\v 39 But for the rest of you, if you have a grievance against others¦98322, it¦98337 needs to be settled¦98337 in a lawful¦98334 assembly¦98336
\v 40 because¦98339 we're in danger¦98340 of being charged with insurrection¦98343 about what happened today¦98346. And we would have no defence that¦98352 we could respond with concerning this disorderly¦98361 gathering¦98361.” Then¦98363 he told them all to go home.

\p
\v 1 After all the commotion¦98374 had died down, Paul¦98378 sent¦98375 for the believers, and after¦98369 greeting¦98386 and encouraging them, he left¦98388 \add Ephesus\add* to go to Macedonia¦98393.\f + \fr 20:1 \ft As he'd already decided—see 19:21.\f*
\v 2 As he travelled through¦98394 the districts¦98398, he challenged the people there with a lot of messages, until he eventually arrived in Greece¦98410.
\v 3 He'd been there about three¦98415 months¦98414 when he heard about a plot by some Jews to waylay him as he boarded a ship to return to Syria¦98431, so instead he decided to return through¦98442 Macedonia¦98444
\v 4 with Sopater¦98456 son of Pyrrhus¦98457 from Berea, Aristarchus¦98461 and Secundus¦98463 from Thessalonica¦98459, Gaius¦98465 from Derbe, Tychicus¦98474 and Trophimus¦98476 from the province of Asia¦98471 \add Minor\add*, and Timothy¦98469 all accompanying¦98445 him¦98450.
\v 5 They went ahead and¦98478 waited for us\f + \fr 20:5 \ft Luke (the writer) includes himself here.\f* at Troas¦98485.
\v 6 So¦98487 we sailed¦98488 out from Philippi¦98495 after the \it Flat Bread Celebration\it*. We arrived and meet the others there at Troas¦98502 after a five-day trip, and then¦98487 stayed¦98513 on there for seven¦98515 days.

\p
\v 7 On the Sunday we had gathered¦98524 together to break¦98529 bread¦98530 together and¦98518 Paul¦98532 was discussing¦98533 many things with them. As he was scheduled to leave the next day, the meeting went on towards midnight¦98544
\v 8 and¦98546 there¦98545 were many lamps¦98548 in the upper¦98552 room¦98552 where¦98553 we¦98554 had all gathered¦98556.
\v 9 Now there was a young¦98561 man¦98561 named Eutychus¦98563 who was sitting¦98557 on the window¦98567 sill, and as Paul¦98576 went on, he fell asleep and toppled down from the third¦98587 storey. The ones who reached him first thought he was dead¦98592,
\v 10 but¦98594 Paul¦98596 had come¦98593 downstairs and bent over Eutychus and held him in his¦98612 arms and said¦98606 to the crowd, “Don't worry, he's still alive.”
\v 11 Then¦98617 Paul went¦98633 back up and broke¦98619 the bread¦98621 with the others, eating a little and continuing to talk with them until¦98629 leaving at daybreak¦98630.
\v 12 The locals took the young man home and¦98643 were very relieved that he was alive.

\p
\v 13 We went ahead to the ship¦98655 and departed for Assos¦98660 where it had been arranged that we'd pick up Paul¦98665 because¦98667 he wanted to walk there¦98661.
\v 14 So¦98678 when we met him at Assos¦98686, he boarded the ship and¦98678 we all sailed on to Mitylene¦98691.
\v 15 After we left Mitylene, we were out from Kios the next day, in Samos¦98706 the day after that, and¦98692 then¦98692 the following day we arrived at Miletus¦98717.
\v 16 Paul¦98722 had decided to sail¦98723 past Ephesus¦98725 because¦98739 he was hurrying¦98738 to try to get to Yerushalem for the Day of Pentecost so he didn't¦98727 want to spend¦98732 time¦98732 in Asia¦98737 \add Minor\add*.
\s1 Paul's farewell to the Ephesian elders
\rem /s1 Paul Speaks to the Ephesian Elders; Paul's Farewell Speech to the Elders of Ephesus
\p
\v 17 So¦98756 while we were at Miletus¦98758, he sent¦98759 a message to Ephesus¦98761 for the elders¦98765 of the assembly¦98767 to come to him.
\v 18 When they arrived¦98770, he told them, “You all know that from the very first¦98785 day¦98786 that I set foot¦98790 in Asia¦98793 \add Minor\add* and¦98769 for the entire¦98781 time¦98807 that I was there
\v 19 I humbly served the \nd master¦98812\nd* even through tears¦98820 and trials¦98822 when the Jews plotted to destroy me.
\v 20 But I didn't¦98839 shrink back from teaching you everything that¦98838 would help you, whether I was teaching in public¦98845 or in individual homes¦98848.
\v 21 I explained to both Jews and Greeks¦98855 how they needed to turn their backs on their sins and towards \nd God¦98859\nd* with faith¦98862 in our¦98870 \nd master¦98868 Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦98873\nd*.
\p
\v 22 However the \nd spirit¦98882\nd* is now forcing me towards Yerushalem even though I don't¦98894 know what will happen to me there.
\v 23 I just know that recently in every¦98904 city¦98906, the holy \nd spirit¦98900\nd* tells me that chains and¦98915 hardships are waiting for me.
\v 24 But I've never regarded my own life as being valuable—I only want to reach the end of my life having served in the way that¦98954 the \nd master¦98960 Yeshua\nd* instructed me to speak out the good message¦98967 about God's grace¦98969.
\p
\v 25 So¦98972 you see, I know that all of you from here where I passed¦98990 through¦98990 proclaiming¦98991 God's kingdom¦98993, you will never see me again.
\v 26 That's why I'm declaring to all of you¦99002 today¦99006 that I'm not guilty of your judgement
\v 27 because¦99018 I didn't¦99017 avoid telling you¦99030 anything that¦99020 I had from \nd God¦99028\nd*.
\v 28 So now you elders look after your own lives and those of your flock¦99038 because the holy \nd spirit¦99043\nd* chose you as overseers¦99048 to shepherd¦99049 the assembly¦99051 of God's people who he paid for with his very own blood¦99062.
\v 29 I'm aware that after¦99072 I leave, vicious wolves¦99077 will come in amongst¦99079 you¦99080 and trying to steal the flock¦99084.
\v 30 Even some of you¦99087 will rise up and¦99085 teach a message that's warped but which will draw some of the believers away to follow it,
\v 31 so take great care. Remember that for three¦99105 years, I never stopped warning each of you along with my tears¦99113
\v 32 so now I'm leaving you all in God's hands and¦99118 with the message¦99130 of his¦99133 grace¦99132 which¦99134 is quite capable of helping you grow to receive the inheritance¦99143 that's for all those who've been purified.
\p
\v 33 I never envied anyone's gold¦99155 or silver¦99152 or \add fancy\add* clothes¦99157
\v 34 and you¦99163 yourselves¦99161 know that I laboured with my own hands¦99179 to cover my expenses and for those with me.
\v 35 Yes, I showed¦99185 you all that it's good to work and to take care of the weaker ones and to remember¦99195 the message¦99198 of the \nd master¦99200 Yeshua\nd* when he said¦99205 that it's better to be a giver than a taker.”
\p
\v 36 When he'd finished speaking, Paul knelt¦99217 down and¦99214 prayed¦99224 with them all.
\v 37 Everyone¦99238 was sobbing as they¦99239 hugged and¦99232 kissed him¦99240
\v 38 because what he'd said about never seeing him again had really distressed¦99241 them. Then¦99260 they accompanied¦99259 him to his¦99257 ship¦99265.

\s1 Paul goes to Yerushalem
\rem /s1 On to Jerusalem; Paul Goes to Jerusalem; Paul's Journey to Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 When it¦99269 was time for us to sail, we¦99285 left them and sailed directly across to Cos¦99288 before going on to Rhodes¦99295 the next day¦99289 and then¦99268 on to Patara¦99298.
\v 2 From there we found¦99302 a ship¦99303 heading to Phoenicia¦99306, so we boarded¦99307 that and¦99301 set off.
\v 3 After sighting Cyprus¦99313 and then¦99311 leaving it¦99317 behind on our left, we sailed on to Syria¦99321 and docked there¦99327 at the port of Tyre¦99326 where the ship¦99331 had cargo¦99335 to be unloaded¦99333.
\v 4 We searched for the believers there¦99343 and¦99338 then¦99338 stayed on with them for seven¦99345 days¦99344. They were inspired by the \nd spirit¦99352\nd* to tell Paul¦99348 not to go to Yerushalem.
\v 5 Once our time was up there and everyone knew that we¦99369 were leaving, even the wives¦99374 and children¦99376 accompanied¦99370 us out of the city¦99380 to the port. We all knelt¦99382 on the beach and prayed¦99390
\v 6 before we continued on and boarded our ship¦99402 and they went¦99398 back to their¦99407 own homes¦99408.
\p
\v 7 So¦99410 we sailed from Tyre¦99415 down to Ptolemais¦99419 where we were able to greet¦99421 the brothers¦99423 and sisters¦99423 and stay overnight with them.
\v 8 The next day¦99430 we continued on to Caesarea¦99441 and ended up in Philip's house¦99446. He was one of the \add original\add* seven¦99454 \add men who had been given the responsibility of distributing aid\add*—a preacher¦99449 of the good¦99449 message¦99449, and we stayed with him¦99457.
\v 9 Philip had four¦99464 unmarried daughters¦99462 still at home, and¦99459 they shared messages from God.
\v 10 Several days¦99471 later a man named Agabus¦99480 came¦99473 from Yudea¦99477. He too shared messages from God
\v 11 and when he arrived, he picked up Paul's belt and tied it around his own feet and hands, telling them that the holy \nd spirit¦99510\nd* had told him that this is how the owner of the belt would be treated by the Jewish leaders in Yerushalem before they would then hand him over to the non-Jews to be dealt with.
\p
\v 12 When we heard¦99537 this described, both we and¦99536 the locals¦99545 begged Paul not to go to Yerushalem
\v 13 but he answered¦99556, “Oh come on, what's all this weeping¦99568 and carrying on that's breaking¦99571 my¦99572 heart¦99574? Actually I'm quite ready¦99587 not only to be tied up, but even to be killed in Yerushalem as a testimony to the \nd master¦99595 Yeshua\nd*.”
\p
\v 14 When we saw that we couldn't change his mind, we didn't¦99598 say anything else, figuring out that whatever the \nd master¦99608\nd* wills for the situation would happen,
\rem /s1 Paul Arrives at Jerusalem
\v 15 and so after¦99616 these¦99621 several days¦99620, we¦99627 had gotten everything ready and started off for Yerushalem¦99631.
\v 16 Some of the believers from Caesarea¦99639 accompanied us and¦99633 led us to the home of a man named Mnason¦99647 to stay—he was an older believer from Cyprus¦99649.
\s1 Paul visits Yacob and makes a vow
\rem /s1 Paul's Arrival at Jerusalem; Paul Visits James at Jerusalem
\p
\v 17 When we arrived at Yerushalem, the brothers¦99662 and¦99653 sisters¦99662 there happily welcomed¦99658 us,
\v 18 and the next day¦99663, we accompanied Paul¦99672 to go and see Yacob\f + \fr 21:18 \ft Yacob is commonly (but wrongly) called James in most older English Bibles.\f* and the elders¦99681 of the assembly there.
\v 19 After greeting¦99685 them, Paul then¦99683 described all the things that \nd God¦99701\nd* had done among the non-Jews as he had served among them,
\v 20 and when they'd heard¦99711 all that¦99732 they praised¦99712 \nd God¦99715\nd* and told Paul, “Brother, you've noticed how many thousands¦99724 of Jews have believed¦99733 \add in the messiah\add* but they still strive to observe¦99721 \add Mosheh's\add* laws.
\v 21 But¦99742 they've heard reports that you've been teaching¦99747 the Jews that live outside our country that they don't have to obey what Mosheh \add wrote\add*—telling them that they don't have to have their¦99763 children¦99764 circumcised¦99761 and¦99742 that they don't have to follow our \add Jewish\add* customs¦99769.
\v 22 What will happen \add now\add*, because \add the leaders here\add* will certainly hear¦99781 that you¦99784 have arrived?
\v 23 So¦99786 here's what we¦99790 suggest that you¦99789 do: Four of our men are making a \add public\add* vow.
\v 24 Why don't you join these¦99800 four and join them in the purification¦99802 ceremony \add at the temple\add* and pay their expenses in getting your heads shaved. Then everyone will be able to see that¦99824 it's false what they've heard about¦99826 you, because you \add clearly\add* still comply with \add Mosheh's\add* instructions¦99825.
\v 25 And as for the believers¦99845 who are non-Jews, we've informed them of our recommendation that they should avoid anything that's been offered to an idol¦99870, avoid consuming blood¦99873 and meat from strangled¦99875 animals¦99875 and birds, and avoid sexual¦99877 immorality¦99877.”
\rem /s1 Paul Is Arrested
\p
\v 26 So the next day¦99887 Paul¦99880 took the \add four\add* men¦99883 for the purification¦99890 ceremony in the temple¦99895 and there they announced¦99896 the date when their vows would be fulfilled¦99898 and their sacrifices made.

\rem /s1 Paul Is Arrested in the Temple; Paul's work in Jerusalem
\p
\v 27 When the seven¦99919 days¦99921 \add of the vow\add* were almost over, some Jews from \add the province of\add* Asia¦99929 \add Minor\add* noticed Paul in the temple¦99936. They stirred up the crowd¦99946 and¦99915 grabbed hold of him,
\v 28 yelling out, “Men of Yisrael. Help us here. This is the man¦99963 who's been teaching¦99981 all around the world against Yisrael and against \add Mosheh's\add* law and against this temple. What's more he brought¦99986 non-Jews here into the temple and so has defiled¦99993 this holy place.”
\v 29 (\add They said this\add* because¦99999 they had previously¦100001 seen¦100001 Trofimus¦100002 from Ephesus in the city¦100007 with Paul¦100019 and had assumed that he had brought¦100017 him into the temple¦100016.)
\p
\v 30 So¦100021 now the whole¦100024 city¦100023 was in an uproar, and the crowds rushed in, grabbed Paul¦100033, and dragged¦100034 him out of the temple and hurriedly closed the temple gates.
\v 31 They were ready to kill¦100051 Paul, but the commander¦100055 of the Roman soldiers had heard that all Yerushalem was in an uproar.
\v 32 Taking some soldiers and officers, he immediately¦100064 ran down to the temple, and when the crowd saw the commander¦100077 and the soldiers they stopped beating Paul¦100085.
\v 33 The commander¦100090 came close and took¦100091 hold of Paul and ordered that he be tied up with a pair of chains¦100096 while he tried to find out who he was and what he'd done wrong.
\v 34 Various people in the crowd¦100117 were shouting out different things, and¦100122 not being able to make any sense of it because¦100127 of all the commotion¦100129, the commander¦100130 ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks¦100135.
\v 35 When they got to the stairs¦100142, the soldiers¦100150 had to lift him¦100147 up above their heads because¦100151 of the frenzy of the crowd¦100156,
\v 36 because¦100158 most of the people¦100162 were following¦100157 and shouting out, “Do away with him¦100167!”
\s1 Paul's defence
\rem /s1 Paul Speaks to the Crowd; Paul Defends Himself
\p
\v 37 As they were able to carry him into the fortress, Paul¦100175 called down to the commander, “Can I say¦100185 something¦100186 to you¦100188?”
\p “You speak Greek!”, replied the commander.
\v 38 “Aren't you¦100196 the Egyptian who stirred up a group of assassins¦100215 a while back and led them out into the wilderness¦100210?”
\p
\v 39 “No, I'm a Jew from Tarsus¦100227 in Cilica—a citizen¦100235 of an important city¦100234,” said¦100216 Paul¦100219. “But please, let me speak¦100243 to these people¦100246.”
\p
\v 40 The commander nodded, so the soldiers stood¦100256 Paul on the stairs¦100259 where he gestured¦100262 to the people¦100267. The crowd quietened down, and¦100249 so Paul spoke loudly in his¦100248 Hebrew¦100280 language¦100281:
\c 22
\nb
\v 1 “Men, brothers¦100284, and¦100285 fathers¦100286, listen¦100287 to what I have to say for myself.”
\v 2 When they heard¦100295 him speaking Hebrew¦100299, they became even more quiet¦100305 as he continued,
\v 3 “I am a Jew who grew up in this very city¦100327 to study under Gamaliel¦100332. I've been raised according¦100335 to every part of our¦100337 ancestral¦100338 law, working hard to obey \nd God¦100343\nd* like all of you¦100347 here today¦100350.
\v 4 I used to persecute¦100356 the followers of ‘The Path’ even to death¦100359—tying up both men and women¦100369 and handing them over to the prisons¦100364
\v 5 as the Chief Priest and all the council¦100383 of elders¦100383 can tell \add you\add*.

\v 6 “But one time as I was travelling and¦100416 getting close to Damascus¦100419 by the middle of the day, suddenly¦100424 a bright light¦100432 from the sky¦100428 began to flash¦100429 around me
\v 7 and¦100442 I fell to the ground¦100441. I heard¦100443 a voice¦100444 asking me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you¦100451 persecuting¦100451 me?’
\v 8 ‘Who are you, master¦100459?’ I answered¦100454. And the voice said¦100460, ‘I am \nd Yeshua\nd*—the one from \nd Nazareth¦100470\nd* that you are persecuting¦100473.’
\v 9 The other¦100488 people with me saw¦100482 the light¦100481 but didn't¦100490 hear the voice¦100489 that spoke to me.
\v 10 Then¦100496 I asked, ‘What do I need to do, master?’ ‘Get up and¦100496 continue into Damascus¦100509,’ the master said. ‘When you get there¦100510, you'll be told everything that you've been assigned to do.’
\v 11 But I couldn't see anything because¦100526 the brightness of the light¦100530 \add had affected my eyes\add*, so my companions had to lead me by hand¦100532 into Damascus¦100540.
\p
\v 12 “In Damascus there was a man¦100544 named Ananias¦100541—a \add non-Jew\add* but who was respected by the Jews there because he strove to obey \add Mosheh's\add* instructions about living¦100555.
\v 13 Ananias came to where I was and standing by me said¦100562, “Brother Saul¦100564, receive¦100566 your sight¦100566!” That very hour¦100570 I was able to see again and look at him¦100574
\v 14 and he said¦100577, ‘The \nd god¦100579\nd* of our¦100582 ancestors¦100581 has decided in advance to reveal his¦100589 plans to you, and for you to see¦100591 the sinless one—to hear¦100595 him speaking
\v 15 because he wants you to inform people¦100607 everywhere what you've seen¦100610 and heard¦100612.
\v 16 So¦100613 what else are you waiting¦100616 for? Get up and¦100613 wash away your¦100623 sins¦100622 by getting immersed¦100618 \add in water\add* as you request his¦100629 forgiveness.’

\v 17 “Then¦100631 when I returned¦100633 to Yerushalem and¦100636 was praying¦100637 in the temple¦100641, I fell into a trance¦100645
\v 18 and saw \add @the master\add* telling me, ‘Get out of Yerushalem in a hurry because¦100659 they¦100661 won't¦100660 accept¦100661 what you're teaching them about me.’
\v 19 ‘\nd Master¦100669\nd*,’ I replied, ‘they¦100670 know that previously I was the one imprisoning¦100675 and¦100676 beating¦100677 the people who believed¦100682 in you¦100684,
\v 20 and when Stephen¦100690 was killed after teaching about you¦100693, it was me standing there and cheering on the ones executing him¦100710 as I held their coats for them.’
\v 21 Then¦100711 \add @the master\add* told me, ‘Get going¦100715 now because¦100716 I'm sending¦100722 you¦100724 away to the non-Jews.’ ”

\p
\v 22 Until this point in his message¦100732, the crowd had been listening to Paul, but now they started shouting, “Do away with this man¦100744! He doesn't deserve to live in this world!”
\v 23 Then they yelled and threw some of their¦100758 clothes¦100759 down onto the ground and threw dust up into the air.
\rem /s1 Paul Reveals His Roman Citizenship
\v 24 So the commander¦100770 ordered Paul to be brought¦100771 inside into barracks¦100776 and ordered that he be flogged¦100778 and interrogated¦100779 to determine what he'd done that would make the crowd react like that.
\v 25 But as they strapped¦100802 him down and stretched¦100797 him out for the flogging¦100820, Paul¦100809 asked the centurion¦100807 standing there, “It is legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't even been tried?”
\p
\v 26 When he heard¦100822 that, the centurion¦100825 went to the commander¦100833 and¦100823 reported¦100835, “How are we going¦100840 to handle this, because¦100843 this man¦100844 is a Roman citizen?”
\p
\v 27 So¦100850 the commander¦100852 went in to where Paul was and¦100850 asked him¦100855, “Tell me the truth. Are you¦100860 a Roman citizen?”
\p “Yes I am,” said¦100854 Paul.
\p
\v 28 “Yeah, and¦100872 I paid a lot for mine as well,” mocked the commander¦100875.
\p “Actually mine is through birth,” Paul¦100890 responded.
\p
\v 29 At this point, the soldiers who were about to interrogate¦100906 Paul left the room, and even the commander¦100909 was now afraid¦100911 after learning¦100912 that he'd had a Roman citizen tied down to be flogged.

\rem /s1 Paul's trials; Paul before the Council; Paul before the High Council; Before the Sanhedrin
\p
\v 30 The next day¦100922, the Roman commander¦100942 still wanted to know¦100926 what was behind the anger of the Jews, so he had Paul released¦100936 from the cell, but¦100923 brought¦100954 him down to a room where he'd ordered the chief¦100946 priests¦100946 and the Jewish council¦100951 to convene. Paul was given a seat
\c 23
\nb
\v 1 and looking directly at the council¦100965 members said¦100968, “Men, brothers¦100970, all my life I have lived¦100975 before \nd God¦100977\nd* as a good¦100974 citizen¦100975 and with a clean conscience¦100973.”
\v 2 But¦100983 Ananias¦100985 the chief¦100984 priest¦100984 commanded¦100987 one of his¦100992 companions to whack Paul on the mouth¦100994.
\v 3 “\nd God¦101008\nd* will strike¦101004 you,” said¦101003 Paul¦100997, “you grand show-off. You've been brought here to judge me as someone who knows the law and¦101011 yet you violate¦101020 the law by commanding¦101021 that I be hit in the face.”
\p
\v 4 But the others standing there said¦101027, “Are you¦101032 insulting¦101032 God's chief¦101029 priest¦101029?”
\p
\v 5 “Brothers¦101039,” said Paul¦101036, “I didn't¦101037 realise that he's the chief¦101042 priest¦101042, because¦101044 the scriptures teach us not to speak¦101051 wrongly¦101052 of our leaders.”
\p
\v 6 But then, knowing¦101053 that the council¦101071 consisted of some from the sect of the Sadducees and some from the Pharisees' party, Paul¦101056 continued loudly, “Men, brothers¦101073, like my father, I'm a member¦101075 of the Pharisees and I'm being¦101086 tried today concerning¦101080 the hope and the resurrection¦101083 of the dead¦101084!”
\p
\v 7 Well, as soon as he said this, the council was split as the Pharisees and¦101088 the Sadducees started arguing.
\v 8 (Sadducees say that¦101123 the dead don't come back to life, and there's no messengers¦101117 and no spirits¦101119, but¦101121 the Pharisees believe there is.)
\v 9 So¦101126 then¦101126 there was a big kerfuffle because some of the teachers¦101135 of the law spoke up for the Pharisees saying¦101144, “We don't see anything wrong with this man¦101150. Maybe it was a spirit¦101154 or one \add of God's\add* messengers¦101158 that spoke to him.”
\p
\v 10 But¦101162 the \add Roman\add* commander¦101172 was afraid¦101169 that they might tear Paul apart¦101174 in the big argument, so he called for his soldiers to come¦101184 down to uplift Paul and¦101162 return him to the barracks¦101196.
\p
\v 11 The following¦101199 night¦101200, the \nd master¦101204\nd* appeared to Paul and told him¦101202, “Be brave because¦101209 just like you testified¦101210 about me here in Yerushalem, so too you'll tell them about me in Rome¦101222.”
\s1 The plan to kill Paul
\rem /s1 The Plan to Kill Paul; The Plot to Kill Paul; The Plot against Paul's Life
\p
\v 12 The next day¦101227, some of the Jews gathered¦101231 informally and¦101226 pledged not to eat¦101244 or drink¦101246 until¦101247 they'd killed Paul¦101255.
\v 13 There were more than forty¦101259 of them in this conspiracy¦101265,
\v 14 and they approached¦101269 the chief¦101271 priests¦101271 and elders¦101274 and told them, “We've¦101276 made an oath to taste¦101280 nothing¦101279 until¦101283 we've killed Paul¦101288, otherwise we'll bring a curse¦101276 on ourselves¦101278.
\v 15 So¦101290 you guys assemble the council¦101305 and report¦101300 to the commander¦101302 so that¦101332 he'll bring¦101309 him down to you all as if you need more information about his actions, and then we'll have an opportunity to kill¦101333 before¦101325 he gets here.
\p
\v 16 But a nephew of Paul had heard¦101339 about this ambush¦101348 and¦101351 went in to the barracks¦101356 to inform Paul.
\v 17 Paul¦101363 then¦101361 called¦101360 one of the Roman centurions¦101366 and¦101361 told him to take the young¦101370 man¦101370 to the commander¦101376 because¦101378 he had something¦101381 to tell him.
\v 18 So¦101385 the centurion took him to the commander¦101391, explaining, “The prisoner¦101395 Paul¦101396, called¦101397 me and asked¦101399 me to bring this young¦101402 man¦101402 to you because he has something¦101408 to report to you.”
\p
\v 19 The commander¦101418 took the young man by the hand¦101415 and led him¦101416 into his¦101416 private office and asked, “What do you¦101428 have to tell me?”
\p
\v 20 “The Jews have decided¦101436 to ask¦101438 you,” he said¦101431, “that¦101437 tomorrow¦101441 you bring¦101444 Paul¦101443 down to the council¦101447 as if they wanted to question him further.
\v 21 But don't¦101463 listen to them because¦101467 over forty¦101473 of their¦101469 men¦101471 will be lying¦101466 in wait for him, and they've sworn not to eat¦101478 or drink¦101480 until¦101481 they've killed him. In fact, they're all set up already, just waiting¦101490 for your consent.”
\p
\v 22 The commander¦101498 told the young¦101501 man¦101501 not to tell anyone¦101504 else about the ambush and dismissed him.

\p
\v 23 Then¦101511 the commander called¦101512 in two of his centurions¦101517 and ordered them to prepare two-hundred soldiers to travel as far as Caesarea¦101525, supported by seventy¦101528 mounted soldiers and two-hundred more with spears¦101530. They were to be ready to leave by 9pm,
\v 24 along with a horse for Paul¦101543 to ride, and¦101538 were to get him safely¦101544 to Governor Felix¦101546.
\v 25 Then the commander wrote¦101565 a letter¦101568 ready to take:
\p
\v 26 “Greetings to the most excellent¦101581 Governor Felix¦101583 from Claudius Lysias¦101578.
\v 27 I'm writing to you about this man¦101586 who had been captured¦101591 by the Jews here and they were about to kill him when I moved in with my soldiers because he is a Roman citizen.
\v 28 I wanted to know¦101619 what they were accusing him of, so I took him down to their¦101633 council¦101632 meeting,
\v 29 but¦101645 I discovered that it was just some detail about their¦101643 \add Jewish\add* law and nothing¦101644 that should result in death¦101647 or imprisonment.
\v 30 Then¦101654 when I learnt that they have a plot to try to ambush and kill him, I sent¦101668 him immediately¦101665 to you, and I'll order his accusers¦101674 to bring their case before¦101680 you.”
\p
\v 31 So¦101685 the soldiers¦101686 carried out their instructions and took Paul¦101693 as far as Antipatris¦101700 during the night¦101697.
\v 32 The next morning the foot soldiers returned¦101712 to the barracks¦101715, leaving the mounted soldiers to take him¦101710 on
\v 33 to Caesarea¦101720, where they¦101727 presented¦101727 Paul¦101730 to the governor¦101726 along with the letter¦101724.
\v 34 After reading the letter the governor asked¦101737 Paul what province¦101741 that he's from and¦101733 found out that he was from Cilicia¦101747.
\v 35 Then he ordered Paul to be kept under guard¦101772 \add in the prison\add* in Herod's palace until he would hear¦101752 from him in the future once his accusers¦101758 got there.

\s1 The Jews accuse Paul before Governor Felix
\rem /s1 The Case against Paul; Paul before Felix at Caesarea; Paul Appears before Felix; The Trial Before Felix
\p
\v 1 Five days¦101778 later, Ananias¦101782 the chief¦101781 priest¦101781 arrived along with some elders¦101785 and¦101787 an attorney¦101788 named Tertullos¦101789, to bring the charges against¦101795 Paul¦101797 before Governor \add Felix\add*.
\v 2 Once he was called¦101798 to speak, Tertullos¦101804 began¦101801 his¦101800 accusation¦101802 of Paul:
\p “We have seen peace¦101807 under your rule and¦101799 the helpful reforms¦101812 that this nation¦101816 has experienced through your provision¦101821,
\v 3 most excellent¦101827 Felix¦101828, and we¦101826 gratefully welcome¦101826 everything you've done and everywhere you've done it¦101826.
\v 4 But in order¦101832 not to oblige you longer than necessary, in your gentleness¦101847 we request you to listen¦101841 to our brief¦101844 statement.
\v 5 This man¦101851 here has been found¦101848 to be a troublemaker, stirring¦101856 up riots among the Jews throughout the inhabited¦101865 world¦101865, and as a ring-leader of the Nazarite sect
\v 6 he even attempted¦101876 to profane¦101877 the temple¦101875 where we¦101880 were able to arrest him.
\v 7 ◘
\v 8 When you examine¦101912 him yourself¦101911 you'll discover all these¦101915 things that¦101917 we're accusing¦101919 him of.”
\v 9 The Jews who had come also affirmed all the accusations.
\s1 Paul's defence against the accusations
\rem /s1 Paul's Defense before Felix
\p
\v 10 So¦101932 the governor¦101939 nodded¦101936 for Paul¦101935 to speak¦101940 and¦101932 he started,
\p “I happily defend¦101956 myself¦101955 today knowing that you have many years¦101943 of experience ruling \add in this region\add*.
\v 11 You can quickly establish that it was less than twelve¦101968 days¦101966 ago that I arrived in Yerushalem to worship there¦101964.
\v 12 They never found¦101982 me in the temple¦101981 arguing with anyone¦101985 or stirring up the crowd¦101991, and¦101977 nor was I doing that in the Jewish¦101995 meeting¦101995 halls¦101995 or anywhere in the city¦101999
\v 13 and so they can't provide evidence to you¦102005 to support any of their accusations¦102011.
\v 14 However, I must confess¦102013 that I follow ‘The Path’ that they¦102022 call a sect which¦102021 serves the \nd God¦102028\nd* of our ancestors¦102027 and¦102035 believes¦102029 everything in \add Mosheh's\add* law as well as the writings of the prophets¦102039.
\v 15 We put our trust in the same God that¦102047 they themselves¦102049 follow, and we all anticipate a resurrection¦102052 of those who serve God and those who don't.
\v 16 Because of this, I also strive to maintain a clean conscience¦102067 in everything¦102077, before \nd God¦102072\nd* and¦102073 the people¦102075.
\p
\v 17 After several years¦102079 away, I arrived¦102089 \add in Yerushalem\add* bringing offerings¦102091 to help my¦102088 own people and¦102090 before God.
\v 18 That was when they¦102095 found¦102095 me in the temple¦102100 after going through the purification¦102097 ceremony, and without either a crowd¦102103 or a commotion¦102106 around me.
\v 19 But there were some Jews from \add the province of\add* Asia¦102112 \add Minor\add* who are the ones who should be appearing here before¦102117 you¦102118, and¦102120 they should be the ones accusing¦102121 me if they could find anything¦102123 against¦102125 me.
\v 20 Even these¦102130 ones here now should¦102131 explain what their council¦102142 found¦102134 me guilty of,
\v 21 other than my calling out that¦102148 I was being¦102160 judged¦102160 because I believe in the resurrection¦102157 of the dead¦102158.
\p
\v 22 But Felix¦102171 who was already familiar with followers of ‘The Path’, announced that the trial would be adjourned until Commander Lysias¦102182 arrived when he would investigate¦102186 further.
\v 23 He ordered the centurion¦102194 to keep Paul confined, but under relaxed¦102201 conditions and allowing any of his¦102207 friends to bring him anything he needed.
\s1 Paul speaks to the governor and his wife
\rem /s1 Paul Held in Custody; Paul before Felix and Drusilla
\p
\v 24 However, several days¦102214 later Felix¦102219 returned there, \add this time\add* with his wife¦102224 Drusilla¦102221 who was Jewish. He sent¦102229 for Paul¦102231 and¦102232 listened to him¦102234 explain about faith¦102241 in the \nd messiah¦102238\nd*.
\v 25 But when the subject turned to righteousness¦102246 and self-control and the coming¦102255 judgement¦102253, Felix¦102262 became very uncomfortable and told him, “That's enough for now. If I have time in the future, I'll send for you.”
\v 26 However he was also hoping¦102277 that Paul¦102284 would give him money¦102279, so he often sent for him and spoke with him.
\p
\v 27 This went on for two¦102296 years¦102296, until Felix was replaced as governor by Porcius¦102303 Festus¦102304, but¦102297 wanting¦102305 to stay in the good books of the Jews, Felix left Paul¦102317 confined.
\c 25
\s1 Tried yet again, Paul appeals to Caesar
\rem /s1 The Trial Before Festus; Paul Appeals to the Emperor; Paul Appears before Festus
\p
\v 1 After Festus¦102319 had been in the area for three¦102326 days¦102327, he made the uphill trip from Caesarea¦102332 to Yerushalem.
\v 2 There the chief¦102340 priests¦102340 and the Jewish leaders¦102343 repeated their case against¦102346 Paul¦102348, and they¦102350 implored¦102350 Festus,
\v 3 asking as a special favour¦102353, that he would order Paul to be sent to Yerushalem (because they wanted to ambush¦102363 and kill¦102365 him on the way¦102369).
\v 4 But Festus¦102373 replied that¦102370 he'd keep Paul¦102377 in Caesarea¦102380 and¦102383 he was heading back there soon,
\v 5 so he told them, “Some of your leaders can go there with me, and if the man¦102404 has done anything¦102399 wrong, they can explain their accusations¦102407 there.”
\p
\v 6 After staying seven or eight¦102417 days¦102413 in Yerushalem, Festus and company travelled back to Caesarea¦102422, and the next day¦102424 he sat¦102426 at the judge's bench and ordered that Paul¦102432 be brought¦102434 in.
\v 7 When he arrived¦102435, the Jews who'd come¦102443 from Yerushalem stood¦102438 facing Paul and¦102446 presented many heavy¦102447 charges¦102448 which¦102454 they¦102456 weren't able to prove.
\v 8 Paul¦102460 defended¦102461 himself, stating that he hadn't sinned¦102478 against any Jewish law or against the temple¦102473, nor against any Roman law.
\p
\v 9 However, Festus¦102480 wanted to be able to grant¦102488 a favour¦102487 to the Jews, so in response to Paul¦102491 he asked, “Are you willing¦102493 to be returned to Yerushalem so that I can judge¦102501 you about these¦102499 things there¦102497?”
\p
\v 10 “I'm here facing Caesar's representative,” Paul¦102507 replied. “and it's quite appropriate¦102517 for me to be judged¦102518 here. I've done nothing¦102520 wrong¦102522 to these Jews as you¦102525 can no doubt see for yourself.
\v 11 If I had done anything wrong¦102533, anything worthy¦102535 of the death sentence, then I'm ready to accept death. On the other¦102544 hand, if none of their accusations¦102549 are true, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar¦102557.”
\p
\v 12 So Festus¦102561 conferred with his legal counsel¦102566 and answered¦102567, “Well, you've appealed¦102569 to Caesar so you'll go to Caesar!”
\s1 King Agrippa wants to hear from Paul

\p
\v 13 Several days¦102573 later, King Agrippa¦102577 and¦102580 \add his sister\add* Bernice¦102581 arrived¦102582 in Caesarea¦102585 to meet Festus¦102589.
\v 14 As they¦102594 \add had planned to\add* stay on for a few days¦102593, Festus¦102598 mentioned about Paul¦102605 to the king¦102600, telling him, “There's¦102609 a prisoner¦102613 here that Felix¦102612 left behind.
\v 15 When I was in Yerushalem, the chief¦102623 priests¦102623 and¦102624 Jewish elders¦102626 reported¦102620 to me, wanting a conviction¦102632 of this man.
\v 16 I told them that it's not the Roman way to convict someone until they've been able to face¦102654 their accusers and¦102660 make their defence¦102661 against the accusations.
\v 17 So¦102667 as soon as they arrived here, on the very next day¦102675 I sat¦102677 on the judge's bench and ordered the man¦102684 to be brought¦102682 in
\v 18 that they were accusing¦102689, but they didn't¦102690 raise even one of the charges¦102691 that I expected.
\v 19 Instead they¦102708 raised some issues about their¦102705 own beliefs and¦102712 about some dead person called \nd Yeshua\nd* that Paul¦102720 reckoned was still living¦102721.
\v 20 I was puzzled about this debate¦102730 and¦102723 asked him if he wanted to be judged¦102740 about these things in Yerushalem.
\v 21 But Paul¦102745 appealed¦102746 to be kept safe from them until he could face the emperor, so I ordered him to be kept \add in prison\add* until I can send him to Rome.”
\p
\v 22 “I'd quite like to hear him myself¦102773,” Agrippa¦102765 said.

\v 23 So¦102784 the next day¦102783, \add King\add* Agrippa¦102788 and Bernice¦102791 formally arrived with all their attendants and entered the auditorium¦102800 to greet the commanders¦102804 and the prominent¦102809 men¦102806 of the city¦102812, and then Festus¦102816 ordered for Paul¦102819 to be brought¦102817 in.
\v 24 Festus¦102823 started, “King Agrippa¦102824 and everyone present¦102829, observe¦102832 the prisoner who a multitude¦102839 of Jews pleaded¦102842 with me about both in Yerushalem and here, that he doesn't deserve to still be alive.
\v 25 But I haven't discovered anything that he's done that's worthy¦102863 of a death¦102865 sentence, and since he himself¦102869 appealed¦102874 to the emperor, I judged¦102877 that that's where he should be sent.
\v 26 The problem is that I don't¦102888 have any charge to write to my master¦102887 and so I've brought¦102892 the prisoner out in front of you so that after you examine¦102904 him, I might have something¦102908 I can write,
\v 27 because¦102912 it¦102914 doesn't seem logical to me to transport a prisoner¦102916 \add to Rome\add* if there's no charges¦102922 specified against¦102920 him¦102921.”

\rem /s1 Paul Defends Himself before Agrippa
\p
\v 1 So then Agrippa¦102924 told Paul¦102928, “Okay, you¦102931 can give your side now then.”
\m So Paul gestured with his hand¦102942 and¦102925 began:
\p
\v 2 “Concerning¦102944 all the charges which¦102946 have been brought against me by the Jews, King Agrippa¦102951, I consider¦102952 myself¦102953 fortunate
\v 3 because you're an expert on Jewish customs¦102976 and issues, so I ask you to listen¦102985 to me patiently¦102984.
\p
\v 4 “All the Jews know about my early life, from my upbringing in my own country¦103001 and¦103004 then in Yerushalem.
\v 5 They also know, and could even testify¦103015 to you if they¦103014 would admit it, that I followed our¦103022 religious¦103023 laws very closely as a member¦103025 of the Pharisees party¦103025.
\v 6 Yet now I stand judged¦103042 for believing in the same hope as our ancestors¦103034—that hope promised¦103036 by our \nd God¦103040\nd*
\v 7 who we twelve¦103046 tribes¦103046 diligently serve day¦103052 and¦103051 night¦103050 in order to obtain—the hope, \add ≈your majesty\add*, for which¦103044 I'm being¦103061 indicted¦103061.
\v 8 So why do you¦103072 all find it¦103070 unbelievable¦103069 that \nd God¦103075\nd* can raise the dead¦103076?
\p
\v 9 “I too \add originally\add* thought it¦103090 necessary¦103090 to do many things to oppose the cause of this \nd Yeshua\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦103089\nd*.
\v 10 So in Yerushalem I worked to have many of these innocent believers locked¦103109 up in prison¦103108 with the authority¦103114 of the chief¦103113 priests¦103113, or if they were to be killed¦103116, I would add my vote against¦103119 them.
\v 11 And in all the Jewish¦103126 meeting¦103126 halls¦103126, \add when I found believers\add* I punished¦103128 them and forced them to curse \add God\add* and treated them with extreme anger, even travelling to further away towns.

\v 12 “So it was one time travelling to Damascus¦103149 carrying permission¦103153 letters from the chief¦103157 priests¦103157
\v 13 that in the middle¦103159 of the day¦103158, \add ≈your majesty\add*, I saw¦103163 a bright light¦103173 from the sky—even brighter than the sun¦103170—and it shone¦103171 on me and my companions.
\v 14 All of us fell down to the ground¦103186 and¦103180 I heard¦103187 a voice¦103188 speaking to me in Hebrew¦103196 saying¦103190, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting¦103202 me? Life will be difficult for you if you resist me.’
\v 15 ‘Who are you, master?’, I asked.
\p “And the master responded¦103210, ‘I am \nd Yeshua\nd*, the one you're¦103212 persecuting¦103223.
\v 16 Now get up, because¦103234 I let you see me in order to appoint¦103237 you as my servant and my witness¦103242—to tell the people what you've seen and what you will be shown.
\v 17 I will rescue¦103251 you from your own people¦103255 and from the non-Jews that I'm sending¦103265 you out to,
\v 18 to open their minds and for them to turn¦103274 back from darkness¦103276 to light¦103278 and from Satan's¦103284 power¦103282 to \nd God¦103287\nd*, so that¦103299 they can be forgiven¦103291 for their sins¦103292 and receive¦103289 an inheritance among¦103295 the ones who've been made guiltless by their faith¦103298 in me.’
\s1 Paul tells about his ministry
\rem /s1 Paul Tells of His Work; Paul Tells of His Preaching
\p
\v 19 “So then, King Agrippa¦103304, I couldn't disobey that vision¦103310
\v 20 so I preached first¦103315 to those in Damascus¦103314 and then in Yerushalem and all of Yudea¦103327, and then in the towns of the non-Jews. I preached about turning from their sins and turning back to \nd God¦103339\nd*, and then actually living like people who had repented¦103334.
\v 21 It was because of these¦103346 things that the Jews grabbed me in the temple¦103356 and tried to do me in.
\v 22 So¦103360 it is that with God's help¦103359 until¦103367 this very day¦103369 I have stood¦103371 testifying¦103372 to commoners and leaders, teaching nothing¦103378 other than what Mosheh and the prophets¦103384 had already written that would happen—
\v 23 that the \nd messiah¦103393\nd* would \add come and\add* suffer¦103391 and as the first¦103395 of the dead¦103398 to come back to life, he is going¦103400 to be proclaiming¦103402 light¦103399 to both Jews and non-Jews.”
\rem /s1 Paul Appeals to Agrippa to Believe
\p
\v 24 Then¦103410 speaking about Paul's defence¦103412, Governor Festus¦103414 said, “Paul, you're stark, raving¦103420 mad! All your education has turned you into an idiot.”
\p
\v 25 But Paul¦103432 said, “I haven't gone mad, most excellent¦103436 Festus¦103437, but¦103438 I'm speaking¦103443 the truth¦103439 in all seriousness.
\v 26 The king knows what I'm talking¦103454 about and that's why I'm speaking boldly¦103453, because¦103445 none of these things were done in a corner¦103467 and I'm sure that none of it has escaped¦103455 his notice¦103455.
\v 27 King Agrippa¦103473, do you believe what the prophets¦103475 \add wrote\add*? Yes, I'm sure you do.”
\p
\v 28 But¦103480 Agrippa¦103481 answered Paul¦103484, “Do you think you can talk me into becoming a follower¦103491 of the messiah¦103491 in just that short time¦103487?”
\p
\v 29 “I hope to \nd God¦103502\nd*”, said Paul¦103496, “whether it takes a short time or a long time, that both you and¦103495 the others listening today¦103519 will become¦103520 just like me except¦103527 for these¦103530 chains.”
\p
\v 30 Then the king¦103538 and the governor¦103541 both stood, along with Bernice¦103544 and the others sitting¦103547 with them
\v 31 and as they left they were saying¦103554 to each other, “That man¦103566 hasn't done anything deserving of death¦103558 or imprisonment.”
\p
\v 32 “Yes, he could have been set free,” replied Agrippa¦103568, “if he hadn't appealed¦103580 to Caesar¦103581.”

\s1 Paul is escorted off overseas
\rem /s1 Paul Sails for Rome; Paul's journey to Rome
\p
\v 1 So¦103583 when it¦103584 was considered the right season to sail to Italy¦103590, Paul¦103595 and¦103596 some other¦103598 prisoners¦103599 were put under the guard of a centurion¦103600 named Julius (from the Augustan¦103605 Regiment).
\v 2 We all boarded¦103606 on a ship¦103608 from Adramyttium¦103609 that was about to sail to various places¦103618 along¦103615 the coast of Asia¦103617 \add Minor\add*. Aristarchus¦103623, a Macedonian man from Thessalonica¦103626, was with us as we¦103619 departed.
\p
\v 3 The next day¦103629 we¦103630 docked at Tsidon where Julius very kindly allowed Paul¦103638 to visit some of his friends¦103643 so they could provide for his needs.
\v 4 When we¦103650 left again, the ship stayed between Cyprus¦103652 and¦103648 the mainland because¦103653 of the unfavourable winds¦103656,
\v 5 then¦103660 after sailing past Cilicia¦103665 and¦103666 Pamfylia¦103667, we¦103669 docked at Myra¦103673 in \add the province\add* of Lycia¦103675.
\v 6 There the centurion¦103680 found¦103678 a ship¦103681 from Alexandria¦103682 that was sailing¦103683 to Italy¦103686, so he boarded us on that.
\p
\v 7 After many days¦103695 of slow and difficult¦103698 sailing¦103696, we came alongside Cnidus¦103702 but the wind¦103707 wasn't helpful to us, so we sailed¦103708 across to Crete¦103710 and along the cape of Salmone.
\v 8 We sailed along¦103715 it¦103716 with difficulty¦103713 until we¦103717 came¦103717 to a place¦103719 called¦103721 ‘Fair Havens’ which¦103724 was near the city¦103727 of Lasea.
\p
\v 9 A lot of time¦103732 had now elapsed¦103733 and¦103734 the voyage¦103739 was starting to become dangerous¦103737 because¦103740 we were already heading into winter. Paul¦103749 advised¦103747 those in charge,
\v 10 telling them, “Men, I perceive¦103753 that we're going to encounter a lot of damage¦103756 on this voyage¦103777, with loss not only of the cargo¦103765 and the ship¦103768, but also our¦103773 lives¦103772.”
\v 11 But the centurion¦103780 was persuaded¦103788 by the ship¦103785 owner¦103785 and¦103783 the captain¦103782, rather¦103787 than by what Paul¦103793 had said.
\v 12 They realised that this harbour wasn't suitable to winter in, so the majority suggested leaving there¦103807 with the expectation of being¦103799 able to get to Crete¦103819 to winter in the harbour at Phoenix¦103815 (which was open to both the southwest¦103822 and¦103823 the northwest¦103825).
\s1 The severe storm at sea
\rem /s1 The Storm at Sea
\p
\v 13 When a south¦103829 wind¦103829 started blowing gently¦103826, they thought they could make it, so they pulled in the anchor and¦103828 sailed along¦103836 close to Crete¦103838.
\v 14 However¦103851, a short while later the wind¦103847 turned to a violent north-easter which¦103849 forced us out to sea.
\v 15 The ship¦103855 was driven by the wind¦103861 and unable to tack to face into it, so the sailors gave¦103862 up and just let it be driven.
\v 16 As we passed a small island¦103864 called¦103868 Clauda¦103869, we got a brief break and¦103865 were able to resecure the lifeboat¦103877
\v 17 and then¦103887 bring it up on board. Then¦103887 ropes were used to wrap around the ship in case it were to run aground¦103892 into the shallows¦103890 at Syrtis¦103891 and the gear was lowered¦103893,\f + \fr 27:17 \ft It's not certain what was meant here—it might have meant lowering the sails further to catch less wind or even lowering the mast, or else letting out the sea anchor to help keep the back of the ship facing the wind.\f* allowing the wind to drive¦103897 the ship along¦103897.
\v 18 We were violently¦103898 tossed¦103901 around by the storm¦103901, and¦103900 the next day¦103903 the crew started \add lightening the ship by\add* tipping \add some of the cargo\add* overboard.
\v 19 By the third¦103909 day¦103909, the sailors themselves \add in desperation\add* were even throwing some of the ship's gear overboard.
\v 20 We didn't see either the sun¦103919 or the stars¦103921 for several more days¦103925—it wasn't a minor storm¦103926 by any means—and¦103927 by then¦103918 any remaining hope that¦103936 we had \add of staying alive\add* disappeared
\v 21 and no one had eaten or drunk much at all.
\p Then¦103940 Paul¦103947 stood¦103945 up in the middle of them and said¦103951, “Well, you should have listened to me after all and not left Crete¦103962, so now we have this damage¦103966 and loss.
\v 22 Nevertheless I think we can all cheer¦103976 up because¦103978 not a single life¦103979 will be lost—only the ship¦103987—
\v 23 because¦103989 last night¦103994 one of the messengers¦104005 of the \nd God¦103998\nd* that I serve came and stood¦103988 beside me
\v 24 and told me not to be afraid because I would indeed get to stand¦104013 before Caesar¦104010 and that \nd God¦104019\nd* has granted¦104016 your lives to me as well.
\v 25 So¦104025 cheer¦104026 up, fellows, because¦104029 I'm certain that \nd God¦104031\nd* will carry out what was told to me
\v 26 even though we'll run¦104048 aground¦104048 onto an island¦104042 first.”
\rem /s1 The Shipwreck
\p
\v 27 So it happened that in the middle¦104061 of our fourteenth¦104051 night of being¦104055 blown across the Adriatic¦104059 Sea, the sailors¦104066 suspected¦104064 that we were nearing land.
\v 28 They dropped a weighted line and measured the ocean depth at around 40 metres and then¦104074 a bit later it was down to 30 metres.
\v 29 Worrying that the ship might run¦104102 aground¦104102 on rough¦104099 \add rocks\add*, they threw out four¦104108 anchors¦104107 from the stern¦104105 as they hoped that daylight would come quickly.
\v 30 Then¦104113 the sailors¦104114 lowered¦104122 the lifeboat¦104124 as if planning to pull out some anchors¦104133 from the bow, but really planning to desert the ship¦104120.
\v 31 However Paul¦104138 told the centurion¦104140 and¦104141 the soldiers¦104143 that if the sailors didn't¦104145 remain¦104147 with the ship¦104150, everybody couldn't be sure to be saved¦104153,
\v 32 so the soldiers¦104159 cut the ropes¦104162 attaching the lifeboat¦104164 and¦104165 allowed¦104166 it to run¦104168 aground¦104168.
\p
\v 33 As they waited for the daylight, Paul¦104179 encouraged them all to eat something, saying¦104183, “Today¦104185 is our fourteenth¦104184 day and¦104170 you've had nothing¦104190 to eat. As we're waiting¦104187,
\v 34 I urge you to eat something. This will help you to have strength because none of you are going to drown.”
\v 35 Having said¦104220 that, he gave¦104226 thanks¦104226 to \nd God¦104229\nd* in front of everyone, and¦104221 breaking some bread¦104225, started eating¦104235 it.
\v 36 They all cheered¦104236 up and¦104237 also started eating.
\v 37 There were two¦104260 hundred¦104260 and¦104249 seventy-six of them on the ship¦104258,
\v 38 and¦104265 when they'd all eaten what they wanted, they lightened¦104268 the ship¦104270 more by throwing¦104271 their wheat¦104273 into the sea¦104276.
\s1 The ship runs aground
\rem /s1 The Shipwreck
\p
\v 39 Once it became¦104280 light, they saw that¦104294 they were close to shore¦104291 in a bay but didn't¦104283 recognise¦104285 the place. After some discussion, they decided to try to save the ship¦104304
\v 40 so they cut away the anchors¦104307 that were holding them in the sea¦104313 and¦104305 untied the rudder¦104319 \add handles\add*. Then¦104305 raising the foresail¦104323, they let the wind¦104324 blow them into the shore¦104329.
\v 41 But they hit a bank with ocean on both sides of it and the ship ran aground¦104335. The bow of the ship was completely stuck¦104343 but¦104331 the stern¦104349 was being¦104350 broken up by the force¦104354 of the ocean.
\p
\v 42 At this point the soldiers¦104359 decided that they¦104365 should kill¦104365 the prisoners¦104364 in case any of them decided to swim away and¦104358 escape¦104369,
\v 43 but¦104372 the centurion¦104373 wanted to keep Paul¦104377 safe so he vetoed that plan. He commanded¦104384 those who could swim to jump off and swim in to shore,
\v 44 and for the others¦104407 to grab \add floating\add* planks¦104405 or something off the ship¦104413 \add that¦104410 would float\add*, and so everyone¦104403 got safely¦104418 onto the beach.

\s1 On the island of Malta
\rem /s1 In Malta; Ashore on Malta; Paul on the Island of Malta
\p
\v 1 Once everyone was safe, we¦104426 discovered that the island¦104430 is called¦104431 Malta.
\v 2 And the people there showed incredible kindness¦104440 to us as they¦104447 welcomed us and lit a fire¦104445, as it started raining again and was very cold¦104458.
\v 3 However when Paul¦104462 was helping to pick up sticks¦104463 and putting them on the fire¦104473, a viper¦104474 was driven out by the heat and clamped¦104481 its jaws down on his¦104485 hand¦104484.
\v 4 When the islanders saw¦104488 the snake hanging from his hand¦104496 they decided that he must be a murderer¦104503 who had survived the shipwreck but now fate had finally decided his time was up.
\v 5 However, Paul just shook the snake off into the fire¦104527 and wasn't harmed.
\v 6 The locals were waiting¦104547 for his arm to swell¦104538 up or for him to fall down dead¦104542, but¦104532 after a while when nothing¦104550 happened they changed¦104555 their¦104555 minds¦104555 and decided that instead, he must be a god¦104562.
\p
\v 7 The area that we had beached in belonged to the leader¦104573 of the island¦104575 named Publius¦104577. He welcomed us and¦104564 looked after us for three¦104581 days¦104582,
\v 8 but while we were there, his father¦104589 got sick with dysentery¦104594 and fever¦104592. Paul¦104601 went in and placing his hands¦104608 on him, prayed¦104604 for him and healed¦104610 him.
\v 9 As a result of that¦104619, anyone on the whole island¦104624 who was sick came and¦104613 was cured
\v 10 and so the people brought us many gifts and when we left, they supplied us with provisions.

\v 11 After three¦104649 months¦104650 we¦104652 were able to leave on an Alexandrian¦104659 ship¦104654 that had wintered¦104655 at the island¦104658. It was decorated with carvings of the twin ‘gods’.
\v 12 We stayed three¦104669 days¦104667 when we¦104666 arrived at Syracuse¦104665
\v 13 and¦104677 then¦104677 we sailed on to Rhegium¦104676. The next day a south¦104682 wind came so we sailed on to Puteoli¦104686
\v 14 where¦104687 we found¦104688 some believers¦104689 and¦104698 they encouraged us to stay for seven¦104697 days¦104696. Then¦104698 we \add finally\add* got to Rome¦104703.
\v 15 The believers¦104707 in Rome had heard¦104708 about us, so they came¦104712 to meet us at the Appius¦104720 Market¦104721 and the Three¦104723 Taverns¦104724. Paul¦104728 was encouraged to see them and thanked¦104729 \nd God¦104731\nd*.

\v 18 who, after examining¦104808 me, wanted to release me because¦104814 I had done nothing worthy of execution.
\v 19 But in defending myself against the Jews there, I felt compelled¦104826 to appeal¦104827 to Caesar¦104828, although I myself had no complaint against the Jews.
\v 20 So¦104841 that was why I called for you and wanted to address¦104849 you, because¦104851 I am in chains¦104857 for the sake of Yisrael's hope—\add the messiah\add*.”

\v 21 “We haven't received¦104872 any correspondence here about you,” they answered. “Nor have any of our brothers¦104880 \add from Yerushalem\add* arrived¦104877 here to report¦104881 any crimes of yours.
\v 22 But we would very much like to hear¦104893 from you about your thinking¦104895, because we've certainly heard about this new sect because everyone¦104907 is speaking out against¦104908 it.”

\p
\v 23 Then¦104910 they set a day¦104912 when they could visit him where he was staying and so that from morning¦104948 to evening¦104950 he could explain¦104922 about God's kingdom¦104928 and show them how Mosheh's law and the prophets' writings spoke about \nd Yeshua\nd*.
\v 24 Afterwards some were persuaded¦104955 while others¦104959 didn't find it believable.
\v 25 They argued back and forth, and as they¦104967 were about to leave, Paul¦104970 shared this final¦104972 message¦104971, “The holy \nd spirit¦104976\nd* spoke¦104979 rightly through Yeshayah the prophet¦104984 to your¦104988 ancestors¦104987, saying:
\q1
\v 26 Go to these people¦104999 and tell them,
\q1 When you listen you will hear¦105003 but not understand¦105009,
\q1 and when you look you will see but not perceive¦105017 it.
\q1
\v 27 Because¦105020 these people's¦105024 minds have become¦105019 dull
\q2 and they can barely hear with their ears
\q2 and they shut their eyes,
\q1 just in case their eyes might actually see,
\q2 and their ears might actually hear,
\q2 and they might understand¦105048 with their minds,
\q1 and turn back to me
\q2 and then I would heal them.
\p
\v 28 So¦105057 now let it¦105058 be known¦105056 to you¦105059 all that the \add message of\add* salvation¦105067 from \nd God¦105069\nd* has been sent¦105064 out to non-Jews and¦105071 they¦105070 will listen.”

\v 29 ◘
\v 30 Paul remained¦105085 in his own rental¦105095 accommodation in Rome for two¦105091 whole¦105092 years¦105091 and¦105096 welcomed¦105097 everyone who went to see him¦105102,
\v 31 telling them about God's kingdom¦105105 and¦105108 boldly teaching¦105109 about the \nd master¦105113 Yeshua\nd* without any hindrance.
