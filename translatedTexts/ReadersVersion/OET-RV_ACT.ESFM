\mt2 The second account by
\mt1 Luke
\mt2 commonly called
\mt1 Acts
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account commonly known as \bk The Acts of the missionaries of Yeshua the Messiah\bk*, is the continuation of \bk The Good Message according to Luke\bk*, and unlike most other Bibles, the \em Open English Translation\em* places these two accounts one after the other.
\is2 This account
\ip The main purpose of this account is to tell about the actions of the first followers of Yeshua the messiah. The spirit of the master helped them to proclaim good message about him “in Yerushalem and all across \add the provinces of\add* Yudea and Samaria, and all the way to the furtherest parts of the planet” (1:8).
\ip This document has three divisions related to the expanding circles as the good message from Yeshua the messiah spread wider and wider: (1) In \bd Yerushalem\bd* where the believers start to get organised after Yeshua ascended up into the clouds; (2) the work and the message spreads wider out to all of the district of \bd Yudea\bd*; and (3) spreading more widely again around the Mediterranean Ocean and all the way to \bd Rome\bd*.
\ip It's also documented here about how God's spirit came to the believers as they were together in a room in Yerushalem at the Festival of Pentecost (fifty days after The Passover). The spirit helps and gives wisdom and strength to the believers and teachers of believers.

\s1 Introduction
\rem /s1 The Promise of the Holy Spirit
\rem /s1 Jesus Taken Up Into Heaven
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 1:1-4.\x*Dear Theofilus¦82401, I wrote my first¦82395 account¦82396 about all the things that \nd Yeshua¦82405\nd* began¦82403 to do and¦82408 to teach¦82409
\v 2 until¦82410 the day¦82412 when he was taken¦82422 up\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Luk 24:51.\x* \add into the sky\add* after, with the help of the holy \nd spirit¦82418\nd*, having¦82414 commanded¦82414 the missionaries that he had chosen¦82421.
\s1 Yeshua, alive, tells them to wait
\p
\v 3 After the time¦82436 of his suffering¦82437, Yeshua presented¦82432 himself¦82433 to them in ways that were infallible proofs¦82441 \add that he was alive again\add*—appearing¦82446 to them and telling them about God's kingdom¦82455.
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4: \xt Luk 24:49.\x*Once when they were together¦82459, he told them, “\wj Don't leave Yerushalem¦82467, but wait there for what was promised¦82473 by the father¦82475, as you all have \add already\add* heard¦82477 me say.\wj*
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5: \xt Mat 3:11; Mrk 1:8; Luk 3:16; Yhn 1:33.\x*\wj Yohan¦82485 immersed \add people\add* in water¦82488, but you all will be immersed in the holy \nd spirit¦82493\nd* in just a few days¦82505.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua's ascension
\rem /s1 The Ascension of Jesus
\rem /s1 Jesus Is Taken Up to Heaven
\p
\v 6 So¦82511 when they were \add next\add* gathered together¦82513, they asked him¦82517, “\nd Master¦82519\nd*, is this now the time when you'll be restoring¦82525 the kingdom¦82528 to Israel¦82531?”\f + \fr 1:6 \ft At the time of asking, Israelis were burdened under the rule and taxes of the Roman occupiers.\f*
\p
\v 7 But¦82537 Yeshua responded¦82536 to them, “\wj You don't¦82540 need to know¦82543 the times¦82544 or seasons¦82546 \add when future events will happen\add*—it's the father¦82549 who decides all that.\wj*
\v 8 \x + \xo 1:8: \xt Mat 28:19; Mrk 16:15; Luk 24:47-48.\x*\wj However, you all will be receiving¦82556 power¦82557 when the holy \nd spirit¦82561\nd* lands on you. Then you'll tell \add people\add* about me in Yerushalem¦82571 and all across \add the provinces of\add* Yudea¦82576 and Samaria¦82578, and all the way to the furtherest parts of the planet.\wj*”
\v 9 \x + \xo 1:9: \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:50-51.\x*After he'd said¦82587 that and while they were still looking at him, he was lifted¦82594 up \add into the sky\add* until they could no longer see him because of the \add #clouds\add*.
\p
\v 10 As they¦82609 stood¦82619 there staring into the sky¦82612 after he'd gone, suddenly two¦82618 men¦82617 in white¦82626 clothes¦82623 were standing beside them
\v 11 and said, “You men from Galilee¦82632! Why are you still standing there looking¦82635 up at the sky? This \nd Yeshua¦82642\nd* who has been taken¦82644 up away from you into heaven will come back in the same way that you saw him go up into heaven.”

\p
\v 12 Then¦82663 they¦82661 walked down the Mount¦82665 of Olives¦82668 and returned¦82661 to Yerushalem¦82672 which was less than a kilometre away.
\v 13 \x + \xo 1:13: \xt Mat 10:2-4; Mrk 3:16-19; Luk 6:14-16.\x*They went¦82686 into the upstairs¦82685 room where¦82687 they were staying¦82689—Peter¦82692 and Yohan¦82695, Yacob and Andrew¦82700, Philip¦82701 and Thomas¦82703, Bartholomew¦82704 and Matthew¦82706, Yacob (son of Alfeus), Simon¦82712 (the Zealot member¦82714), and Yudas¦82716 (son of Yacob).
\v 14 They were united in their ongoing prayers¦82725, along with Maria¦82735 the mother¦82738 of \nd Yeshua¦82740\nd*, and his¦82745 brothers¦82744.
\p
\v 15 Then¦82746 one day, Peter¦82754 stood¦82752 up in the meeting of the believers¦82758 (about¦82771 120¦82773 of them) and¦82762 said¦82760,
\v 16 “Brothers¦82776, it was necessary¦82777 for the scripture¦82781 to be fulfilled¦82779, where the holy \nd spirit¦82786\nd* had spoken¦82784 previously¦82784 through David¦82791 about Yudas¦82793, the one who guided¦82796 those that arrested¦82798 \nd Yeshua¦82800\nd*
\v 17 because Yudas was one of us and¦82807 took his part in our work¦82813.
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18-19: \xt Mat 27:3-8.\x*(Yudas had bought a field with the money¦82822 he had received for his treachery, and when he had fallen down \add in that field\add*, his stomach had burst¦82829 open and his intestines¦82835 had slid out \add on the ground\add*.
\v 19 So¦82838 everyone in Yerushalem¦82845 started calling¦82847 that place ‘The¦82855 field of blood¦82860’.)
\p
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: a \xt Psa 69:25; \xo b \xt Psa 109:8.\x*Now it was written¦82861 in the scroll¦82864 of songs¦82865:
\q1 ‘Let his place become¦82866 deserted¦82870 with no one living¦82876 there,’
\m and
\q1 ‘Let another¦82885 person take¦82884 his position.’
\p
\v 21 So¦82887 now it's appropriate¦82886 for one of the men¦82891 that has been with us for the whole time¦82895 that the \nd master¦82905 Yeshua¦82906\nd* was interacting with us,
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: a \xt Mat 3:16; Mrk 1:9; Luk 3:21; \xo b \xt Mrk 16:19; Luk 24:51.\x*from Yeshua's immersion¦82911 by Yohan¦82912 until¦82914 the day¦82916 that he was lifted up from us \add into the clouds\add*—a witness¦82921 of the resurrection¦82923—to fill this position.
\p
\v 23 So¦82931 they¦82932 selected two¦82934 men: Yosef¦82935 Barsabbas¦82939 (nicknamed Justus¦82942) and¦82943 Matthias¦82944.
\v 24 Then¦82946 they requested¦82947, “\nd Master¦82952\nd*, you know everyone's inner thoughts, so reveal¦82955 to us which¦82956 of these¦82959 two¦82961 that you have chosen¦82957
\v 25 to take this position of service¦82973 and being an missionary—the position that Yudas¦82981 deserted to go to his own place.”
\v 26 So¦82990 they drew straws and Matthias¦83000 was marked so he was chosen¦83004 to join the eleven¦83008 missionaries.

\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1: \xt Lev 23:15-21; Deu 16:9-11.\x*When the Day of Pentecost actually arrived, the believers met together¦83030 in the same¦83034 room¦83034.
\v 2 Suddenly there was a noise in the sky that sounded¦83042 like a strong¦83046 wind¦83045, then it¦83049 filled¦83049 the entire¦83051 house¦83053 where¦83054 they¦83055 were sitting¦83057.
\v 3 They saw what looked like tongues¦83062 of fire¦83064 that kept dividing¦83061\f + \fr 3:1 \ft See https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/what-%E2%80%9Cdivided-tongue%E2%80%9D-acts-2-3-0\f* and¦83065 then settling down on each one of them.
\v 4 In this way they were all filled¦83075 with the holy spirit and began¦83081 speaking in other¦83084 languages¦83085 as the spirit enabled them.
\p
\v 5 At the time, there were godly¦83105 Jews¦83103 staying¦83101 in Yerushalem¦83098 that had come from other countries¦83109 all around the world.
\v 6 When they heard this noise, lots of people¦83121 came¦83119 to investigate but they were confused¦83123 because¦83125 they heard the believers talking¦83134 in their¦83138 own languages¦83133 \add from around the world\add*.
\v 7 They were astounded¦83139 and¦83143 marvelled¦83144, asking, “Wow, aren't these¦83153 people talking¦83156 all Galileans¦83158?
\v 8 So¦83159 how come we're hearing¦83162 them speak the languages¦83167 of the countries where we were born?
\v 9 There's people here from Parthia¦83174, Media¦83176, Elam, Mesopotamia¦83183, Yudea¦83184, Cappadocia¦83187, Pontus¦83188, Asia¦83191 \add Minor\add*,
\v 10 Frygia, Pamfylia, Egypt¦83196 \add (Mitsrayim)\add*, Libya¦83202 (near Cyrene¦83205), and visitors¦83208 from Rome,
\v 11 Crete¦83215, and Arabia¦83217. Some are Jews and some are non-Jews who've converted¦83213 \add to Judaism\add*. And we¦83219 can hear¦83219 them talking¦83220 about \nd God¦83228\nd* in our¦83223 languages¦83224.”
\v 12 Everyone was amazed¦83229 and¦83232 totally puzzled, asking each other, “What's¦83243 going on here?”
\v 13 But others¦83250 scoffed¦83252 and said, “Ha, they've just had too much to drink.”
\s1 Peter's sermon
\rem /s1 Peter Preaches to a Crowd
\rem /s1 Peter Addresses the Crowd
\rem /s1 Peter's Message
\p
\v 14 So the twelve stood¦83263 up and Peter¦83266 told the crowd in a loud voice¦83275, “People of Yudea¦83283 and everyone staying¦83287 in Yerushalem¦83288. Listen to me so that I can explain this to you.
\v 15 This group is not drunk¦83308 like you're all thinking¦83306, because¦83312 it's still mid-morning,
\v 16 but¦83319 you're seeing what the prophet¦83326 Yoel¦83327 wrote about:
\q1
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17-21: \xt Yoel 2:28-32 (LXX).\x*God said, ‘In the last days¦83335 I will pour out my¦83344 \nd spirit¦83343\nd* on all humanity—your children will tell of future events, your young¦83363 men will see visions¦83365, and your old men will have dreams¦83373 \add from God\add*.
\v 18 I will pour my \nd spirit¦83398\nd* out on my male and female slaves¦83381 and they¦83402 will tell of future events.
\v 19 I will do unusual things with the stars and planets, and also down on the earth¦83414 below¦83415: blood¦83416, fire¦83418, and clouds of smoke¦83421.
\v 20 I'll make the sun¦83423 go dark and the moon¦83431 go blood¦83433 red. This will happen before¦83434 the great¦83441 victorious day¦83438 of the coming of the \nd master¦83439\nd*.
\v 21 Then¦83444 everyone¦83446 who relies on the name¦83452 and authority of the \nd master¦83454\nd* will be saved¦83455.’
\p
\v 22 “Fellow Israelis, listen¦83459 to this account: You yourselves¦83493 know that God did miracles¦83476 through \nd Yeshua¦83463\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦83465\nd*, and he fulfilled signs¦83480 \add from the scriptures\add*—in fact God did this right in front of you.
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Mat 27:35; Mrk 15:24; Luk 23:33; Yhn 19:18.\x*Then as part of God's plan and foreknowledge¦83500, this Yeshua was taken to the authorities by those who didn't follow their own laws, and you¦83510 all killed¦83510 him by having him executed¦83509 on a pole.
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24: \xt Mat 28:5-6; Mrk 16:6; Luk 24:5.\x*But \nd God¦83514\nd* released him from the agonies¦83518 of death and brought him back to life—death couldn't restrain¦83526 him.
\v 25 \x + \xo 2:25-28: \xt Psa 16:8-11 (LXX).\x*As David¦83530 wrote,
\q1 ‘I foresaw¦83537 the \nd master¦83539\nd* always being in front of me. I refuse to be afraid because¦83545 he's there on my¦83548 right¦83547.
\q1
\v 26 Because¦83553 of that, I was happy and spoke out my¦83557 praises. My¦83557 whole body¦83570 lives in anticipation
\v 27 because¦83575 you will never abandon¦83577 my¦83580 soul¦83579 in Hades¦83584, nor will you allow the godly¦83588 one to decay¦83591.
\v 28 You showed me the roads to life¦83596. You fill me with gladness¦83599 because of your¦83604 presence¦83603.’
\p
\v 29 “Fellow Israelis, we can tell you¦83612 all with confidence¦83610 that our patriarch¦83615 David¦83616 both died¦83619 and was buried¦83621, and his¦83626 tomb¦83625 is still here with us today.
\v 30 \x + \xo 2:30: \xt Psa 132:11; 2Sam 7:12-13.\x*So¦83636 because he was a prophet¦83635, and knowing¦83640 that \nd God¦83646\nd* has promised him to seat one of his descendants on his throne¦83665,
\v 31 he was foretelling the resurrection¦83672 of the \nd messiah¦83674\nd* who was neither¦83676 ‘abandoned¦83678 in Hades¦83685 nor did his¦83690 body¦83689 decay¦83693.’
\v 32 Then \nd God¦83700\nd* raised¦83698 this \nd Yeshua¦83697\nd* back to life and we're all witnesses¦83706 of that.
\v 33 Now he's sitting at God's right¦83711 hand¦83711, and having received¦83725 the promise¦83719 of the holy \nd spirit¦83721\nd* from the father¦83728, he poured¦83729 this out which¦83733 you are all seeing¦83739 and hearing¦83741 \add today\add*.
\v 34 \x + \xo 2:34-35: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*You see, David¦83744 never went up to the heavens¦83748, but he himself¦83753 said,
\q1 ‘The master said to my master: Sit down at my right¦83764
\q1
\v 35 until¦83766 I defeat your¦83772 enemies¦83771.’
\p
\v 36 “So let all Israel¦83784 know that this \nd Yeshua¦83801\nd* that you¦83803 executed¦83804 on a pole, \nd God¦83796\nd* made him¦83789 both the \nd master¦83787\nd* and¦83790 the \nd messiah¦83791\nd*.”
\rem /s1 The First Converts
\p
\v 37 When the people heard¦83810 that, they were deeply troubled and asked Peter¦83827 and the other¦83830 missionaries, “What should we¦83834 do then, brothers¦83837?”
\p
\v 38 Peter¦83840 responded, “Turn away \add from your sins\add* and each one of you needs¦83849 to be immersed¦83849 by the authority of \nd Yeshua¦83858\nd* the \nd messiah¦83859\nd*. Then¦83841 your sins will be forgiven¦83861 and you all will receive¦83867 the gift¦83869 of the holy \nd spirit¦83872\nd*,
\v 39 because¦83875 that promise¦83878 is to you all and your¦83883 children¦83881 and to their descendants—to anyone who will call out to the \nd master¦83894\nd*, our¦83897 \nd God¦83896\nd*.”
\p
\v 40 Then Peter shared further teaching with them and¦83905 encouraged them to save themselves out from this corrupt generation¦83912.
\v 41 Because of that, those who welcomed¦83921 his¦83925 teaching were immersed¦83926 and about¦83936 three¦83937 thousand¦83937 people were added¦83928 to their numbers that day¦83932.
\rem /s1 The Fellowship of the Believers
\v 42 They continued listening to the teaching¦83944 of the missionaries, and in building their relationships with each other, and in breaking¦83954 bread¦83956 and praying together.

\p
\v 43 They were serious in their learning about God, and the missionaries did many miracles and signs¦83971 of God's power in Yerushalem and all the people wanted to be right with God.
\v 44 \x + \xo 2:44: \xt Acts 4:32-35.\x*All those who did believe¦83991 were united in purpose¦83995 and¦83996 had shared use of many things.
\v 45 Some sold their properties¦84004 and possessions¦84009 and divided¦84013 them among the group so that everyone had everything they needed.
\v 46 Each day¦84027 they¦84046 \add worshipped\add* together at the temple¦84034 and also went to various homes to break¦84041 bread¦84045 together. They talked about Yeshua at their mealtimes without sophistication,
\v 47 praising¦84054 \nd God¦84056\nd* and being popular with the people¦84064, and every¦84071 day¦84072 the \nd master¦84067\nd* was adding¦84068 more that were being saved¦84070.

\p
\v 1 One afternoon around 3pm, Peter¦84084 and Yohan¦84091 were going¦84092 to the prayer¦84104 meeting in the temple¦84095.
\v 2 Now there was a man¦84111 who had been lame from birth, and every¦84122 day¦84123 he was placed beside a door¦84126 into the temple—an entry named ‘Beautiful¦84131 Door’. From there he could beg from the people entering¦84138 the temple.
\v 3 He saw Peter¦84151 and¦84152 Yohan¦84153 about to enter¦84156 into the temple¦84159, so he asked them for a donation,
\v 4 but¦84167 Peter¦84169 and Yohan¦84175, looking closely at him¦84172 said¦84178, “Look at us!”
\v 5 So¦84184 the man grabbed onto them, expecting¦84188 to get given something¦84189 by them.
\v 6 But Peter¦84199 said¦84195, “I don't¦84204 have any silver or gold¦84203, but¦84197 I'll give you what I do have. With the authority of \nd Yeshua¦84216\nd* the \nd messiah¦84217\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦84219\nd*, \add I command you\add* to walk¦84223.”
\v 7 Then¦84224 Peter grabbed¦84225 the man by the right¦84228 hand¦84229 and pulled him upwards. Immediately the man's feet¦84240 and ankles¦84245 were strengthened¦84237
\v 8 and he jumped up and stood¦84249 and started walking and went¦84254 into the temple¦84259 with them, walking and skipping and praising¦84264 \nd God¦84266\nd*.
\v 9 All the people¦84272 \add there\add* saw¦84268 him¦84273 walking¦84274 and¦84275 praising¦84276 \nd God¦84279\nd*,
\v 10 and recognising¦84280 that he was the man who usually sat \add outside\add* begging at the ‘Beautiful¦84298 Door’ of the temple¦84303, they were astonished and astounded at what had happened¦84313 to him.

\v 11 As the man clung onto Peter¦84325 and Yohan¦84329, all the people¦84338 ran¦84331 to see them in Solomon's¦84352 Porch and they were really astounded¦84355.

\v 12 But when Peter¦84360 saw \add the crowd\add*, he answered¦84362 their thoughts¦84379, “Fellow Israelis, why are you all puzzled about this, and why are you staring at us as if this man is walking¦84392 because of \em our\em* power¦84383 or closeness to God.”
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Exo 3:15.\x*The god of Abraham¦84396, Isaac¦84400, and Yacob¦84404—the god of our¦84410 fathers¦84409—gave honour to his¦84415 servant¦84414, \nd Yeshua¦84416\nd*, who you handed over \add to be killed\add* and then you rejected him when Pilate¦84431 had judged¦84433 him and wanted to release him.
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14: \xt Mat 27:15-23; Mrk 15:6-14; Luk 23:13-23; Yhn 19:12-15.\x*You disowned¦84446 this man¦84450 who was innocent and sinless, and instead you requested¦84448 that a murderer¦84451 be released to you.
\v 15 However in doing so, you¦84459 killed¦84459 the creator of life¦84458, who \nd God¦84462\nd* then raised¦84463 from the dead¦84465 as we¦84468 can attest.
\v 16 Now it's \add our\add* faith in the authority of Yeshua that has strengthened¦84484 \add the legs\add* of this man that you have seen and that you already knew—this authority and faith that comes from Yeshua completely¦84497 healed this man right in front¦84499 of you all.
\p
\v 17 So¦84502 now, friends, I know that you did \add all\add* that in ignorance¦84512, just like your¦84519 leaders,
\v 18 but¦84521 \add actually\add* \nd God¦84522\nd* was fulfilling¦84536 what he had had written by the prophets¦84530, that the \nd messiah¦84534\nd* should suffer¦84532.
\v 19 Because of that, \add you¦84547 all need to\add* repent¦84538 and¦84540 turn¦84542 back \add to God\add* so that your¦84547 sins¦84549 can be erased,
\v 20 and then times¦84555 of refreshing¦84556 will come¦84554 from the presence¦84558 of the \nd master¦84560\nd*, and so that he may send¦84562 \nd Yeshua¦84568\nd* the \nd messiah¦84567\nd* who has been appointed¦84564, back \add to save\add* you.
\v 21 \add For now\add* it¦84572 is appropriate¦84572 for heaven¦84573 to receive¦84575 him¦84595, until¦84576 the times¦84577 of restoration¦84579 of everything, which¦84581 \add again\add* \nd God¦84584\nd* has had written by the faithful prophets¦84596.
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Deu 18:15,18 (LXX).\x*Indeed¦84598 Mosheh said¦84600, ‘The \nd master¦84611\nd*, our¦84614 \nd God¦84613\nd* will raise up a prophet¦84607 for you that's like one of your¦84620 own brothers¦84618. You must listen to everything he says—whatever he tells you.
\v 23 \x + \xo 3:23: \xt Deu 18:19.\x*Everyone who doesn't listen¦84643 to that prophet¦84645 will end up totally destroyed¦84647 and not part of \add God's\add* people¦84651.’
\v 24 Similarly, the prophets¦84656 from Samuel¦84658 onwards spoke in turn, and when they spoke they foretold these¦84672 \add current\add* days¦84671.
\v 25 \x + \xo 3:25: \xt Gen 22:18.\x*And you are the descendants of those prophets¦84678, and part of the agreement between \nd God¦84686\nd* and your ancestors¦84690, when he told Abraham¦84695, ‘All the families¦84706 in the world will be blessed¦84703 by one of your descendants.’
\v 26 \nd God¦84713\nd* had raised¦84711 up his¦84717 servant¦84716 and sent¦84719 him to you \add Jews\add* first¦84710, to bless¦84722 you by turning¦84727 each of you away from your¦84736 own wicked¦84734 \add behaviour\add*.”

\s1 Peter and Yohan are threatened by the religious leaders
\rem /s1 Peter and John before the Council
\rem /s1 Peter and John Before the Sanhedrin
\p
\v 1 While Peter and Yohan were still talking¦84737 to the people, the chief¦84749 priests¦84749 and a temple¦84755 officer¦84753 and some people from the Sadducee sect approached¦84746 them
\v 2 because¦84764 they were very upset about what they had been teaching¦84766 the people¦84769, including preaching¦84772 that \nd Yeshua¦84776\nd* could give life to the dead¦84786.
\v 3 So¦84787 they arrested¦84788 the two, and as it¦84802 was already¦84805 evening¦84804, they put them in jail¦84797 overnight.
\v 4 Despite this, many people who had heard¦84809 their message¦84811 trusted \add in Yeshua\add* and¦84813 the number¦84816 of \add families\add* who were believers¦84812 grew to around 5,000.
\p
\v 5 Then¦84826 the next day¦84828, the religious leaders and the elders¦84841 and the religious teachers¦84845 gathered¦84831 together¦84831 in Yerushalem¦84848
\v 6 along with those descended¦84871 from high priests, including Annas¦84851 the current high priest¦84855 and Caiafas¦84858 and Yohan¦84863 and Alexander¦84866.
\v 7 After \add having¦84874 Peter and Yohan brought in and\add* standing them in the middle, they¦84879 began to ask, “Under what authority did you¦84891 do this?”
\p
\v 8 Then Peter¦84893, having¦84894 been filled¦84894 with the holy \nd spirit¦84895\nd*, said¦84897 to them, “Rulers¦84900 of the people¦84902 and¦84903 elders¦84904,
\v 9 if we're being¦84910 questioned today¦84909 about a good¦84914 deed done to a man¦84915 who couldn't walk and which resulted in his healing,
\v 10 then you all need to know, and the people¦84931 of Israel¦84932 should¦84924 also know, that it was done under the authority and name of \nd Yeshua¦84938\nd* the \nd messiah¦84939\nd*. He was the man from \nd Nazareth¦84941\nd* that you executed¦84944 on a pole, but who \nd God¦84947\nd* brought back to life. It was because of his authority that this man can now stand before¦84955 you without deformity.
\v 11 \x + \xo 4:11: \xt Psa 118:22.\x*This Yeshua is:
\q1 ‘the stone¦84961 which was rejected by you¦84966 builders¦84969,
\q1 has now become¦84972 the \add vital\add* cornerstone¦84975.’
\m
\v 12 We can't be saved by anyone¦84981 else, because¦84987 there's¦84991 no other¦84980 name¦84989 or authority that's been given¦84999 in the entire world under¦84994 which people¦85001 can be saved.
\p
\v 13 The assembled leaders were amazed¦85024 when they saw the boldness¦85013 of Peter¦85012 and Yohan¦85015 who they knew to be illiterate¦85020, working-class men¦85019 Then¦85009 they recognised¦85025 that they had been with \nd Yeshua¦85032\nd*,
\v 14 but since the man¦85037 who was no longer deformed was standing there with them, there was nothing¦85045 that they¦85046 could really accuse them of.
\v 15 So they had them removed from the room, and they asked each other,
\v 16 “What should we do with these¦85069 fellows? By now everyone in Yerushalem¦85083 has heard about the miracle they did, and we have no way to rebuff it¦85090.
\v 17 However, we have to stop it spreading¦85100 even further, so maybe we should ban them from speaking¦85114 about this name¦85117 to anyone¦85119.”
\v 18 So¦85126 they called¦85128 them back in and decreed that they weren't allowed to preach or teach¦85139 under the name¦85142 of \nd Yeshua¦85144\nd* anymore.
\p
\v 19 But Peter¦85148 and¦85149 Yohan¦85151 answered¦85152, “You judge \add for yourselves\add* whether¦85158 it's right¦85159 in God's eyes to listen to you¦85164 rather¦85166 than to him?
\v 20 As for us, we're not able to be silent about what we saw¦85177 and heard¦85180.”
\v 21 So¦85184 after making some further¦85185 threats¦85185, the leaders sent¦85186 them off. They hadn't been able to find anything to punish¦85194 them for, because the people¦85200 were all praising \nd God¦85205\nd* for what had happened
\v 22 \add and\add* because¦85210 the man¦85216 who had miraculously recovered was over forty¦85213 years¦85209 old.

\v 23 After Peter and Yohan had been released, they went¦85228 to their¦85230 own \add group\add* and told them what the chief¦85239 priests¦85239 and elders¦85242 had said¦85243.
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Exo 20:11; Neh 9:6; Psa 146:6.\x*When they all heard¦85247 this, they began to pray out loud to \nd God¦85259\nd*, saying, “Master¦85263, you¦85264 created heaven¦85270 and earth¦85273 and the sea¦85276, and everything in them.
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25-26: \xt Psa 2:1-2 (LXX).\x*You spoke \add long ago\add* by the holy \nd spirit¦85288\nd* through our¦85286 ancestor who was your¦85297 servant¦85296, David¦85294, when you¦85297 said¦85298,
\q1 ‘Why are the other nations angry and¦85303 why have their peoples¦85304 tried new \add ideas\add*?”
\q1
\v 26 The earthly¦85312 kings¦85310 and rulers¦85315 stood and worked together¦85316 against the \nd master¦85322\nd* and against his¦85327 \nd messiah¦85326\nd*.’
\m
\v 27 \x + \xo 4:27: a \xt Luk 23:7-11; \xo b \xt Mat 27:1-2; Mrk 15:1; Luk 23:1; Yhn 18:28-29.\x*And indeed Herod¦85346 and Pontius¦85349 Pilate¦85350 met with the pagan¦85352 \add Romans\add* and the peoples¦85354 of Israel¦85355 to conspire against¦85337 your¦85341 holy servant¦85340 \nd Yeshua¦85343\nd* who you chose.
\v 28 Then they did exactly what your¦85360 power and plan had already decided would happen.
\v 29 So¦85367 now, \nd master¦85370\nd*, see their¦85376 threats¦85374 and¦85377 help us, your slaves¦85380, to be able to proclaim your message¦85388 with boldness¦85384.
\v 30 Let us experience your power to heal and do miracles and things that confirm the scriptures by means of the name¦85409 \add and authority\add* of your holy servant¦85412, \nd Yeshua¦85414\nd*.”
\p
\v 31 As they finished their¦85417 requests, the place¦85420 where they had met was shaken¦85418 and all of them were filled¦85426 with the holy \nd spirit¦85433\nd*, and they \add went out and\add* boldly proclaimed God's message¦85437.

\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32: \xt Acts 2:44-45.\x*And so the group of believers¦85450 were united in their will and attitude. No one claimed anything¦85469 to be their own, but they shared everything they had.
\v 33 The missionaries of the \nd master¦85502\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦85503\nd*, experienced great power¦85488 and proclaimed the truth about how he came back to life, and \add God's\add* favour was with them.
\v 34 None of them were lacking anything, because¦85524 any of them who owned properties¦85527 or houses¦85530 would sell them and donate the proceeds.
\v 35 They would lay them down in front of the missionaries, and from there it¦85548 was distributed¦85548 around according to what needs each person had.

\v 36 Yosef¦85559 (a Levite born in Cyprus¦85576 who was nicknamed by the missionaries as ‘Barnabas¦85564’, meaning ‘Encourager’) \add was one who\add*
\v 37 owned a field¦85583 which he sold, and brought¦85585 the money¦85587 and put it down in front of the missionaries.

\s1 The death of Ananias and Sapphira

\p
\v 1 But in contrast, a couple named Ananias¦85599 and Sapphira¦85603 sold a property¦85609
\v 2 but agreed together to hide some of the proceeds. So Ananias brought¦85623 a smaller amount and put it¦85631 down in front of the missionaries.
\v 3 Then Peter¦85636 said¦85633, “Ananias¦85639, why has Satan¦85647 filled¦85643 your¦85650 mind¦85649 such that you would lie to the holy \nd spirit¦85654\nd* and keep aside some of the proceeds of the property¦85665?
\v 4 Wasn't it yours before it was sold? And even when it was sold, the money was still yours. Why did you decide¦85682 to handle it like this? It wasn't people¦85694 that you're lying¦85693 to, but \nd God¦85697\nd*.”
\v 5 When Ananias¦85702 heard that, he fell down and stopped¦85708 breathing¦85708. Everyone who heard about it felt very afraid,
\v 6 and the young¦85721 men¦85721 there stood up and covered¦85722 his \add body\add*, carried it out, and buried¦85726 him.
\p
\v 7 Three hours¦85731 later, Ananias' wife¦85736 came in, not knowing¦85739 anything about¦85730 what had happened.
\v 8 Peter¦85750 checked, “Is it true that you¦85761 guys sold the property¦85759 for such-and-such an amount?”
\p “Yes, for that amount,” she¦85762 replied.
\p
\v 9 But Peter¦85770 said¦85770 to her, “Why did the two of you agree¦85777 to test the \nd spirit¦85782\nd* of the \nd master¦85784\nd*? The guys who just buried¦85789 your¦85792 husband¦85791 are just out the door¦85796, and they'll carry you out as well.”
\v 10 Sapphira immediately¦85804 fell down in front of him¦85809 and stopped¦85811 breathing¦85811. Then¦85803 the young¦85815 men¦85815 came in and found¦85816 her dead¦85819, so they took \add her body out\add* and buried¦85825 her with her husband¦85828.
\v 11 So¦85830 the entire¦85835 assembly¦85837 of believers became¦85831 very afraid, along with every else who heard about these¦85844 events.

\p
\v 12 The missionaries went on to do many miracles and amazing things, and all the people¦85861 who gathered in Solomon's¦85875 Porch had a united vision,
\v 13 but¦85887 no one else dared to join them. However, the people¦85891 were talking positively about them
\v 14 and more were becoming believers¦85896 in the \nd master¦85898\nd*—big numbers of both men and women¦85903.
\v 15 Some would even bring¦85910 those who were sick¦85912 out to the side of the road, lying them on beds and mats waiting for Peter¦85924 to come past so that \add even\add* his shadow¦85927 might touch them.
\v 16 More crowds were coming¦85942 from the towns around Yerushalem¦85953, bringing¦85954 those who were sick¦85955 and those tormented¦85957 by demons¦85961, and they were all getting healed¦85964.

\v 17 But the chief¦85971 priest¦85971 and his colleagues who were members of the sect of Sadducees¦85981 were filled¦85982 with jealousy¦85983 and took action
\v 18 by having the missionaries arrested¦85986 and thrown into the public¦85999 jail¦85998.
\v 19 But one of the \nd master's¦86010\nd* messengers¦86007 opened¦86016 the prison¦86022 doors¦86020 during the night¦86013 and¦86025 led them out again, saying,
\v 20 “Now go and stand in the temple¦86034 and keep telling the people¦86036 all the teaching about \add new\add* life¦86041.”
\v 21 So¦86044 at dawn, having taken notice of the messenger, they went¦86045 into the temple¦86051 and started teaching¦86053 \add the people there again\add*.
\p When the chief¦86058 priest¦86058 arrived¦86054 with his companions, they called together¦86067 the \add religious\add* council and also the \add political\add* council of Israel¦86077, then called for the missionaries to be brought¦86083 in from the prison¦86082.
\v 22 But when their attendants¦86093 got to the jail, they weren't there, so they returned¦86101 to the gathering and told them,
\v 23 “We found the prison¦86110 all locked up with the guards¦86119 in their positions at the doors¦86125, but¦86127 when they opened¦86126 it up, there was no one inside¦86128!”
\v 24 When they¦86133 heard¦86133 this, the officer¦86142 of the temple¦86144 and¦86145 the chief¦86147 priests¦86147 were totally puzzled as to what could have happened.
\v 25 Just then someone¦86159 came in and¦86177 told them, “Hey, the men¦86166 that you¦86168 put in prison¦86171 are in the temple¦86175—standing there teaching¦86178 the people¦86180.”
\v 26 So the temple officer¦86184 took the attendants¦86187 and went and got them, but didn't use force¦86194 because¦86197 they were afraid that the people¦86199 might start throwing rocks at them.
\p
\v 27 So¦86205 they¦86207 brought¦86204 them in and stood them in front of the council¦86210, where the chief¦86216 priest¦86216 addressed them,
\v 28 \x + \xo 5:28: \xt Mat 27:25.\x*“We officially commanded¦86220 you all not to be teaching in this name¦86227 and authority. But see¦86230 here, now you have filled¦86231 Yerushalem¦86234 with your¦86237 teaching, and what's more, you're blaming us for the death of that man¦86246.”
\v 29 But Peter¦86252 and¦86253 the other missionaries answered¦86249, “It's better to obey \nd God¦86261\nd* than people¦86264.
\v 30 The \nd god¦86273\nd* of our¦86276 ancestors¦86275 brought \nd Yeshua¦86278\nd* back to life after you¦86280 all handed¦86281 him over to be hung up on a pole.
\v 31 But \nd God¦86287\nd* honoured this way-maker and saviour¦86290 by placing him¦86295 in the place of honour, to \add encourage\add* Israel¦86300 to repent¦86298 and \add then\add* to forgive¦86302 their sins¦86303.
\v 32 We are witnesses¦86312 of these¦86317 messages¦86316, along with the holy \nd spirit¦86320\nd* who \nd God¦86328\nd* gave¦86326 to the ones who obey him¦86331.”
\p
\v 33 When the gathered councils heard¦86334 this, they were enraged and wanted to kill¦86340 them,
\v 34 but¦86343 a certain¦86344 member¦86351 of the Pharisee¦86351 party¦86351 named Gamaliel¦86353 stood up in the council¦86349 chamber. He was a law teacher¦86354 respected by all the community, and he ordered the \add guards\add* to take them outside¦86362 for a while,
\v 35 then he said¦86370, “Fellow Israelis, think carefully about what you're planning to do with these¦86390 men¦86389.
\v 36 A while back, a man called Theudas¦86401 became¦86434 prominent, saying¦86402 that he was someone¦86404 important. Eventually about¦86417 four¦86419 hundred¦86419 others joined¦86411 him, but he was killed¦86422 and those who had followed him were dispersed¦86432 and it all came to nothing¦86436.
\v 37 A bit later on, a Galilean¦86442 man named Yudas¦86440 became prominent at the time of the census and he attracted people¦86450 to him. But he also died, and all those who'd been persuaded¦86463 by him ended up being¦86463 scattered¦86465.
\v 38 So¦86466 here's my advice to you¦86472 all: pull back from \add killing\add* these¦86477 men¦86476 and allow¦86479 them \add to continue\add*, because¦86486 if this teaching and goings on is man-made, it'll be overthrown,
\v 39 but if it's from God, you all won't be able to bring them down in case you find yourselves opposing God.”
\p So¦86529 they were persuaded¦86528 by Gamaliel,
\v 40 and after calling¦86532 in the missionaries and having them beaten, they commanded¦86536 them not to speak¦86540 using the name¦86544 and authority of \nd Yeshua¦86546\nd* and then sent¦86548 them out.
\v 41 So¦86552 the missionaries left the councils¦86559, very excited that they were considered¦86561 worthy¦86561 to be disgraced because of Yeshua.
\v 42 After that, they¦86581 never stopped teaching¦86582 and preaching¦86584 the good¦86584 message¦86584 about \nd Yeshua¦86589\nd* the \nd messiah¦86588\nd* in the temple¦86576 and in various homes.

\v 1 However around that time when the number of Yeshua-followers were growing, some of the Greek converts starting grumbling¦86601 about the Jewish believers because¦86607 the Greek widows¦86616 were being¦86608 overlooked¦86608 in the daily¦86614 sharing \add of food and money\add*.
\v 2 So¦86624 the twelve¦86626 \add missionaries\add* assembled the believers together and told them, “We're not pleased¦86636 about having to take time off \add sharing\add* the message¦86643 of \nd God¦86645\nd* to be serving¦86646 here at the \add distribution\add* tables¦86647.

\v 5 This idea pleased¦86690 the group, so they¦86702 went ahead and chose¦86702 Stephen¦86705 (a man¦86706 full of faith¦86709 and of the holy \nd spirit¦86712\nd*), Philip¦86716, Procorus, Nicanor¦86720, Timon¦86722, Parmenas¦86724, and Nicolas¦86727 (a non-Jew from Antioch¦86729 who had previously converted¦86728 to Judaism).
\v 6 They stood¦86733 these seven up in front of the missionaries, who prayed¦86741 and¦86739 then placed their¦86744 hands¦86745 on them.
\p
\v 7 God's message¦86748 continued spreading and the number of followers in Yerushalem¦86760 was rapidly increasing, and a large number of the priests¦86766 became believers.

\p
\v 8 Now Stephen¦86774 \add (one of the seven)\add* was full of grace¦86777 and power and was doing¦86781 miracles and amazing demonstrations of God's power among¦86786 the people¦86788.
\v 9 But a group from the Freedmen¦86806 Synagogue as well as \add Jews\add* from Cyrene¦86808, Alexandria¦86810, Cilicia¦86814, and Asia¦86816 \add Minor\add* rose up and started arguing against Stephen¦86819,
\v 10 but they weren't able to refute the wisdom¦86826 that he spoke \add with the help of\add* the pure \nd spirit¦86833\nd*.
\v 11 So they¦86854 got some men¦86855 \add to falsely accuse Stephen\add* saying¦86856, “We heard¦86859 him¦86860 denigrating Mosheh and¦86868 \nd God¦86870\nd*.”
\v 12 So¦86872 they stirred¦86871 up the people¦86874 and the elders¦86877 and the law teachers¦86880 and so they approached¦86882 \add Stephen\add* and arrested him and brought¦86887 him to the council¦86891 \add chambers\add*.
\v 13 There they¦86893 produced the false¦86896 witnesses¦86895 saying¦86899, “This man¦86903 won't stop spreading messages¦86910 against this holy \add temple\add* and against the law
\v 14 because¦86922 we¦86921 heard¦86921 him¦86923 saying¦86924 that that \nd Yeshua¦86926\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦86928\nd* will be tearing¦86930 down this building and¦86934 will be changing¦86935 the traditions that Mosheh¦86942 gave¦86940 to us.”
\v 15 So¦86943 then the council¦86957 members looked¦86944 across at Stephen and saw that his¦86963 face \add was shining\add* like that of one \add of God's\add* messengers¦86966.

\p
\v 1 Then¦86972 the chief¦86974 priest¦86974 asked \add Stephen\add*, “Is all this true?”
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 7:2-3: \xt Gen 12:1.\x*And he replied, “My brothers¦86988 and fathers¦86990, please listen¦86991. Our¦86999 honoured \nd God¦86993\nd* was seen¦86996 by our¦86999 ancestor Abraham¦87000 in Mesopotamia¦87004 before¦87005 he moved to Haran¦87010
\v 3 and he told him, ‘Leave your land and your relatives¦87024, and go to the place that I will show you.’
\v 4 \x + \xo 7:4: a \xt Gen 11:31; \xo b \xt Gen 12:4.\x*So¦87046 he left Chaldea¦87041 and moved to Haran¦87045, and then after¦87049 his¦87054 father¦87053 died, he moved again to this land where we now live.
\v 5 \x + \xo 7:5: \xt Gen 12:7; 13:15; 15:18; 17:8.\x*Abraham hadn't received any land here as an inheritance¦87078, in fact he'd never been near this land and nor did he have any children¦87105, yet God promised¦87086 to give¦87088 this \add entire\add* country to him and his¦87098 descendants¦87097.
\v 6 \x + \xo 7:6-7: \xt Gen 15:13-14.\x*And yet \nd God¦87111\nd* \add also\add* told him¦87119 that his¦87119 descendants¦87117 would end up staying in another¦87123 country where they would be enslaved¦87125 and mistreated¦87129 for four¦87132 hundred¦87132 years¦87131.
\v 7 \x + \xo 7:7: \xt Exo 3:12.\x*However \nd God¦87146\nd* promised to punish the nation¦87136 that enslaved them, and told him that in the end they would leave that place¦87158 and serve¦87140 him here in this country.
\v 8 \x + \xo 7:8: a \xt Gen 17:10-14; \xo b \xt Gen 21:2-4; \xo c \xt Gen 25:26; \xo d \xt Gen 29:31–35:18.\x*And he contracted with Abraham about being circumcised, and so when Abraham had Isaac, he circumcised him on the eighth¦87177 day¦87174, and then Isaac went on to have Yacob, and Yacob to have the \add twelve\add* tribal leaders.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 7:9: a \xt Gen 37:11; \xo b \xt Gen 37:28; \xo c \xt Gen 39:2,21.\x*Those brothers went on to become jealous¦87192 of Yosef¦87194 and sent him back into Egypt¦87197 \add as a slave\add*, but \nd God¦87201\nd* was with him
\v 10 \x + \xo 7:10: \xt Gen 41:39-41.\x*and rescued¦87205 him out of all his¦87212 troubles there. Then God gave¦87214 him wisdom¦87219 and caused him to gain the favour¦87216 of \add Far'oh (Pharaoh¦87222)\add*, the king¦87223 of Egypt, who then appointed¦87226 him as the ruler of all Egypt and over Far'oh's own household¦87235.
\v 11 \x + \xo 7:11: \xt Gen 42:1-2.\x*Then¦87239 a famine¦87240 hit all Egypt¦87248 and Canaan¦87250 causing great¦87253 distress and our¦87261 ancestors¦87260 were unable to find enough food.
\v 12 But Yacob¦87265 heard¦87262 that grain¦87267 was available in Egypt¦87271, so first¦87280, he sent¦87273 off our¦87279 tribal leaders.
\v 13 \x + \xo 7:13: a \xt Gen 45:1; \xo b \xt Gen 45:16.\x*On their second¦87285 visit, Yosef revealed himself to them, and¦87292 so Far'oh became¦87294 aware of Yosef's heritage.
\v 14 \x + \xo 7:14: a \xt Gen 45:9-10,17-18; \xo b \xt Gen 46:27 (LXX).\x*Then¦87304 Yosef¦87305 sent¦87303 for his¦87310 father¦87309 Yacob¦87307 and¦87312 all the extended family—some seventy-five¦87319 of them.
\v 15 \x + \xo 7:15: a \xt Gen 46:1-7; \xo b \xt Gen 49:33.\x*So¦87323 Yacob¦87326 went¦87324 to Egypt¦87328, where he and the \add twelve\add* tribal leaders eventually died¦87330,
\v 16 \x + \xo 7:16: \xt Gen 23:3-16; 33:19; 50:7-13; Josh 24:32.\x*although their bodies were moved to Shekem where they were put into the tomb¦87346 that Abraham¦87350 had bought from the sons¦87355 of Hamor.
\p
\v 17 \x + \xo 7:17-18: \xt Exo 1:7-8.\x*But as the time¦87367 limit promised¦87372 to Abraham¦87377 by \nd God¦87375\nd* was getting closer, \add our\add* people¦87380 multiplied¦87382 in Egypt¦87384
\v 18 until¦87385 another¦87389 Far'oh¦87391 \add Far'oh (Pharaoh)\add* ended up ruling there who had never known¦87395 Yosef¦87398.
\v 19 \x + \xo 7:19: a \xt Exo 1:10-11; \xo b \xt Exo 1:22.\x*He took advantage¦87402 of us Jews and mistreated¦87406 our¦87405 ancestors¦87408, even forcing them apart from their¦87416 own babies¦87414 so they wouldn't live.
\v 20 \x + \xo 7:20: \xt Exo 2:2.\x*Mosheh was born during that time¦87423 and¦87427 \nd God¦87431\nd* considered him beautiful¦87429. He spent three¦87435 months¦87434 in his \add own\add* father's¦87440 house¦87438
\v 21 \x + \xo 7:21: \xt Exo 2:3-10.\x*before being placed outside, from where Far'oh's¦87456 daughter¦87455 took¦87451 him and brought¦87458 him up herself¦87461 as her own son.
\v 22 So¦87464 Mosheh was instructed¦87465 in all the wisdom¦87471 of the Egyptians, and was a powerful¦87477 speaker and project leader.
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 7:23-29: \xt Exo 2:11-15.\x*But when he hit forty¦87490, it entered his mind¦87495 to visit¦87497 his relatives, the Israelis.
\v 24 When he noticed one of them being mistreated, he retaliated¦87511 and while defending the oppressed man, he struck¦87518 \add and killed\add* the Egyptian.
\v 25 He thought his¦87539 relatives would understand¦87530 that \nd God¦87536\nd* was bringing salvation¦87542 to them via him¦87539, but¦87546 they¦87544 didn't see it that way.
\v 26 So¦87551 on the following¦87552 day¦87553 when he saw two of them quarrelling¦87556, he tried to resolve the situation by saying, ‘Men, you're all brothers¦87573. Why are you injuring¦87578 each other?’
\v 27 But the bullying one pushed¦87586 him¦87587 away and¦87594 said¦87588, ‘Who made you¦87591 the judge¦87595 over us?
\v 28 Do you want to kill¦87600 me like you killed¦87606 that Egyptian yesterday¦87607?’
\v 29 \x + \xo 7:29: \xt Exo 18:3-4.\x*When he heard that, Mosheh fled \add Egypt\add* and became¦87623 an exile in Midian¦87627 where¦87628 he \add eventually\add* had two¦87631 sons¦87630.
\p
\v 30 \x + \xo 7:30-34: \xt Exo 3:1-10.\x*After another forty¦87640 years¦87638, he was in the wilderness¦87645 around Mount¦87647 Sinai¦87649 when he saw a messenger¦87650 in the flame¦87653 of a burning thorn¦87657 bush.
\v 31 Mosheh was amazed at the vision¦87665 when he saw it, so he approached¦87667 \add the bush\add* to look more closely when he heard Yahweh's voice¦87673 saying,
\v 32 ‘I am the god of your¦87687 ancestors¦87686—the god of Abraham¦87690 and of Isaac¦87694 and of Yacob¦87698.’ At that point, Mosheh started trembling¦87699 and was scared to go any closer to look,
\v 33 but \nd Yahweh¦87718\nd* said¦87710, ‘Take off your¦87727 sandals¦87722, because¦87729 the ground¦87738 you're standing on is dedicated to God.
\v 34 I have noticed the mistreatment¦87746 of my¦87749 people¦87748 in Egypt and heard¦87758 their¦87756 groaning¦87755 and so I came¦87761 down to rescue¦87762 them, so now I'm going to send¦87767 you¦87769 \add back\add* to Egypt.’
\p
\v 35 \x + \xo 7:35: \xt Exo 2:14.\x*This was the same Mosheh that they had previously rejected and asked who had made him ruler and judge¦87783 over them. Now \nd God¦87788\nd* had indeed sent him as ruler and liberator by means of the messenger¦87800 that he saw in the thorn¦87806 bush.
\v 36 \x + \xo 7:36: a \xt Exo 7:3; \xo b \xt Exo 14:21; \xo c \xt Num 14:33.\x*So eventually Mosheh led them out of Egypt¦87818 after doing miracles and signs¦87814 of God's power there, and then also at the Red Sea and during the forty years¦87828 in the wilderness¦87827.
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37: \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*This same Mosheh told Israelis that in the future \nd God¦87845\nd* would raise up another prophet¦87840 like him from among them.
\v 38 \x + \xo 7:38: \xt Exo 19:1–20:17; Deu 5:1-33.\x*Now Mosheh was the person that \add led\add* the assembly¦87864 \add of people\add* in the wilderness¦87867, was spoken to by one \add of God's\add* messengers¦87870 on Mt¦87876. Sinai¦87877, and¦87878 one of our¦87882 ancestors¦87880 that received¦87885 living¦87888 messages to pass on to us.
\p
\v 39 “Yet our¦87900 ancestors¦87899 didn't want to obey that man, so they rejected him and started thinking about Egypt¦87916 again,
\v 40 \x + \xo 7:40: \xt Exo 32:1.\x*saying to Aaron¦87920, ‘Make some gods¦87923 for us to lead us because¦87928 we've got no idea what happened to that Mosheh who led us out of Egypt¦87938.’
\v 41 \x + \xo 7:41: \xt Exo 32:2-6.\x*So¦87945 together they made a calf as an idol¦87956 to bring sacrifices¦87954 to, and they were pleased with what they'd achieved.
\v 42 \x + \xo 7:42-43: \xt Amos 5:25-27 (LXX).\x*But \nd God¦87969\nd* turned¦87965 and allowed them to serve the heavenly¦87977 armies, just as the prophets¦87983 wrote¦87979,
\q1 ‘It wasn't me that you Israelis sacrificed¦87987 to for those forty years¦87990 in the wilderness¦87994.
\q1
\v 43 You turned to Molech's tent and Rephan's star¦88009 as your¦88012 gods by making images¦88016 of them to bow down to. So¦88001 for that, I'll send you all away into exile beyond¦88028 Babylon¦88029.’
\p
\v 44 \x + \xo 7:44: \xt Exo 25:9,40.\x*The tent of evidence was with our¦88039 ancestors¦88037 in the wilderness¦88042—made to the pattern¦88056 that God had shown Mosheh.
\v 45 \x + \xo 7:45: \xt Josh 3:14-17.\x*Our¦88066 ancestors¦88065 then carried that tent into the land, having¦88063 inherited¦88063 it along with Joshua from the possession¦88072 of the pagans which¦88060 \nd God¦88079\nd* drove¦88076 out ahead of them. The tent remained there until¦88086 the time of David¦88089
\v 46 \x + \xo 7:46: \xt 2Sam 7:1-16; 1Ch 17:1-14.\x*who found¦88091 favour¦88092 with \nd God¦88095\nd* and¦88096 requested¦88097 to find a tent for the house¦88102 of Yacob¦88104,
\v 47 \x + \xo 7:47: \xt 1Ki 6:1-38; 2Ch 3:1-17.\x*but¦88107 it was Solomon¦88105 who built¦88109 the house¦88112 for God \add to reside in\add*.
\p
\v 48 However the highest¦88117 one doesn't actually live in structures made by people, but¦88113 as the prophet¦88127 wrote,
\q1
\v 49 \x + \xo 7:49-50: \xt Isa 66:1-2.\x*‘Heaven is my throne¦88134,
\q1 and¦88137 the earth¦88138 is where I place¦88152 my feet¦88141.
\q1 How could you¦88145 possibly build¦88145 a suitable house¦88144 for me?
\q1
\v 50 Wasn't it me that created everything?’
\p
\v 51 \x + \xo 7:51: \xt Isa 63:10.\x*You stiff-necked people with uncircumcised¦88167 hearts¦88172 and ears¦88176! You're always¦88178 opposing¦88183 the holy \nd spirit¦88180\nd* just like your¦88188 ancestors¦88187 were.
\v 52 Which¦88192 one of the prophets¦88194 wasn't persecuted¦88196 by your¦88200 ancestors¦88199? Even the ones that foretold¦88205 the coming of the righteous¦88211 one were killed¦88202 off by them in just the same way that you yourselves became¦88219 his betrayers¦88215 and murderers¦88217!
\v 53 You had received¦88221 the law under the direction of messengers¦88226, and¦88227 yet you didn't obey it¦88229.”

\p
\v 54 When they heard that, they were raging inside and grating¦88241 their¦88243 teeth¦88244 at him¦88246.
\v 55 But being¦88247 full of the holy \nd spirit¦88252\nd*, Stephen stared up into the sky and¦88261 was able to see God's splendour, as well as seeing \nd Yeshua¦88262\nd* standing there on God's right¦88267.
\v 56 He said¦88273, “I can look through the sky that's opened¦88278 up and can see humanity's child standing at God's right¦88287 side.”
\p
\v 57 At this point, they blocked their¦88298 ears¦88297 and rushed¦88300 together to grab Stephen, yelling loudly¦88294.
\v 58 They drove him out of the city¦88309 and then started throwing¦88305 rocks at him. His accusers left their¦88319 cloaks in charge of a young¦88324 man¦88324 named¦88326 Saul¦88327.
\v 59 As Stephen¦88332 was being hit by the rocks, he called out, “\nd Master¦88336 Yeshua¦88338\nd*, receive¦88340 my¦88343 spirit¦88342.”
\v 60 Then¦88345 falling to his knees¦88347, just before he died he called out loudly¦88351, “\nd Master¦88354\nd*, don't¦88355 hold this sin¦88362 against them.”

\v 5 Around the same time, Philip¦88455 went to a city¦88460 in Samaria¦88463 and told them about the \nd messiah¦88467\nd*.
\v 6 Crowds gathered and listened carefully to Philip¦88482 and watched him do miracles—

\s1 Simon the magician seeks power
\rem /s1 Simon the Sorcerer
\p
\v 9 One man¦88530 in the city¦88539 had been practicing¦88540 magic¦88540 and amazing¦88542 the people¦88546, and he claimed that he was someone¦88551 great¦88553. His name¦88533 was Simon¦88534
\v 10 and the people there from the least to the most important said, “This power is from the great \nd god¦88568\nd*.”
\v 11 They gave him¦88574 a lot of attention because¦88575 he'd been amazing them with magic¦88580 for quite a long time¦88578.
\v 12 However when Philip¦88588 started preaching¦88590 the good message about God's kingdom¦88595 and the name and authority of \nd Yeshua¦88603\nd* the \nd messiah¦88604\nd*, they believed¦88585 the message, and many men and women¦88609 asked to be immersed¦88605 \add in water\add*.
\v 13 Simon¦88612 himself¦88614 also believed¦88615 and was immersed¦88617, and then started accompanying Philip¦88622 around—marvelling¦88634 as he observed¦88623 the miracles¦88629 and signs¦88627 of God's power.
\p
\v 14 When the missionaries in Yerushalem¦88640 heard¦88636 that many people from Samaria¦88646 had accepted God's message¦88648, they¦88652 sent¦88652 Peter¦88656 and¦88657 Yohan¦88658 out to them
\v 15 so then they prayed¦88661 for them to receive¦88665 the holy \nd spirit¦88666\nd*.
\v 16 (The holy spirit hadn't fallen¦88676 on any of them at that point, but¦88678 they¦88680 had only been immersed¦88679 into the name¦88683 and authority of the \nd master¦88686 Yeshua¦88687\nd*.)
\v 17 So Peter and Yohan placed their¦88693 hands¦88694 on the new believers and they received¦88698 the holy \nd spirit¦88699\nd*.
\p
\v 18 When Simon¦88705 the magician saw that they received the \nd spirit¦88716\nd* after having¦88701 the hands¦88711 of the missionaries placed on them, he offered¦88719 money¦88722 to Peter and Yohan, saying,

\p
\v 26 Then a messenger¦88890 from the \nd master¦88892\nd* spoke¦88893 to Philip¦88895, “Start walking and head south¦88903 on the road that goes downhill from Yerushalem¦88911 to Gaza¦88913 through the wilderness¦88916.”
\v 27 So¦88917 he headed off, and \add on the road\add* he came across an important official¦88925 of the Ethiopian¦88923 queen\f + \fr 8:27 \ft Some translations list the queen's name as ‘Candace’, but that was the name of the series of queens, cf., Far'oh (Pharaoh) or Caesar which came to be used as a title for more than one person.\f* who was in charge of her¦88937 treasury¦88936. This man¦88922 had been in Yerushalem¦88943 to worship God
\v 28 and was returning¦88948 home in his¦88954 chariot¦88953. As he rode, he was reading¦88956 \add the scroll of\add* the prophet¦88962 Isayah¦88963,
\v 29 and the \nd spirit¦88967\nd* told Philip¦88969 to approach him and stay by the chariot¦88974.
\v 30 So¦88978 Philip¦88980 ran up to the chariot and heard¦88981 the man reading from the prophet¦88986 Isayah¦88984 and asked, “Do you know what it is that you're¦88994 reading about?”
\p
\v 31 “How could I know when I don't¦89006 have someone¦89007 to guide me,” he answered, and so he invited Philip¦89015 to climb up and sit¦89017 with him.
\v 32 Now the particular passage¦89022 that he was reading¦89026 was this:\x + \xo 8:32-33: \xt Isa 53:7-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘He was led away like a sheep¦89031 being led to the slaughterhouse¦89033,
\q1 and stayed as silent¦89045 as a lamb being shorn
\q2 so he never opened his¦89051 mouth¦89050.
\q1
\v 33 He was humiliated¦89054 by a lack of justice¦89057.
\q1 Who can name his descendants,
\q2 because his life¦89072 is being¦89067 taken from the earth¦89070?’
\p
\v 34 “Now tell me,” said¦89080 the official, “who was Isayah talking about? Was he talking about himself¦89090 or someone¦89094 else?”
\v 35 So¦89096 Philip¦89098 started with that passage and explained the good¦89109 message¦89109 about \nd Yeshua¦89112\nd* to him.
\v 36 As they were going¦89115 along¦89116 the road¦89118, they came to some water, and the official asked, “Look¦89127, here's some water. What would stop me from being immersed¦89132 here?”
\p
\v 37 ◘
\v 38 So¦89156 he commanded¦89157 \add the driver\add* to stop the chariot¦89160 and they both climbed down, and Philip¦89169 immersed¦89174 the official in the water¦89166.
\v 39 But as they came out of the water¦89181, the \nd master's¦89190 spirit¦89182\nd* snatched¦89191 Philip¦89193 away and so the official never saw¦89196 him again, but¦89177 he continued on his¦89206 journey very happy.
\v 40 As for Philip¦89208, he found¦89210 himself at \add the town of\add* Azotus¦89212, and as he passed through¦89214 \add the coastal towns\add* on the way to Caesarea¦89225, he proclaimed the good¦89215 message¦89215 in each town.

\p
\v 1 Meanwhile Saul¦89228 was still¦89230 spouting off murderous¦89234 threats¦89232 towards¦89235 the followers of the \nd master¦89239\nd*. He went to the chief¦89242 priest¦89242
\v 2 and obtained \add official\add* letters¦89247 to enable him to enter the Jewish¦89253 meeting¦89253 halls¦89253 in Damascus¦89249 so that if he found either male or female followers of Yeshua, he could arrest them and bring¦89268 them to Yerushalem¦89270 in chains.
\p
\v 3 On his journey as he approached Damascus¦89279, suddenly¦89281 light¦89286 from the sky¦89291 flashed¦89285 around¦89285 him.
\v 4 He dropped to his knees\f + \fr 9:4 \ft It seems most likely that Paul and company were walking to Damascus (and not on horseback despite paintings by Caravaggio and others).

\p
\v 5 “Who are you, master¦89311?” he¦89306 asked.
\p And the voice replied, “I'm \nd Yeshua¦89318\nd*, the one that you're¦89322 persecuting¦89323.
\v 6 Now, stand up and go into the city¦89351, and you'll be told there what you need to do.”
\p
\v 7 Meanwhile his travelling¦89364 companions had stood¦89366 there speechless¦89367, because they had heard the voice¦89371 but couldn't see anyone¦89369.
\v 8 They helped Saul¦89379 up from the ground¦89382, but even when he opened¦89383 his¦89390 eyes¦89389, he couldn't see anything. So¦89377 they had to lead him into Damascus¦89399 by hand¦89394.
\v 9 Saul stayed there for three¦89403 days¦89402, unable to see and¦89406 not eating or drinking anything.
\s1 Ananias restores Saul's sight
\p
\v 10 Now there was a believer there in Damascus¦89418 named Ananias, and the master spoke to him in a vision¦89428, calling, “Ananias.”
\p “I'm here, master,” he answered.
\p
\v 11 So¦89439 the \nd master¦89440\nd* told him¦89442, “Get up and¦89452 go to Yudas' house¦89455 in Straight¦89451 Street where you'll find a man named Saul¦89457 from Tarsus¦89459. He's praying¦89462 right now
\v 12 and in his vision¦89467, he saw¦89464 a man¦89465 named Ananias¦89470 who comes in and places his hands¦89478 on him so that he can receive¦89480 his sight¦89480 back.”
\p
\v 13 But¦89482 Ananias¦89484 resisted, “\nd Master¦89485\nd*, I've heard¦89487 a lot about that man¦89492, including all the evil¦89495 things he's done to your¦89499 dedicated people in Yerushalem¦89502,
\v 14 and¦89504 the reason he's here in Damascus with the authority¦89507 of the chief¦89510 priests¦89510 is to arrest everyone who trusts in you¦89517.”
\p
\v 15 But the \nd master¦89523\nd* said¦89518, “Go now, because¦89525 I have chosen that man¦89531 to be a bearer of my¦89536 name¦89535 and authority both in other countries, even to their kings¦89542, and to the descendants of Israel¦89545,
\v 16 because¦89547 I'll be showing¦89548 him what he's going to have to suffer¦89557 for bearing my¦89556 name¦89555.”
\p
\v 17 So¦89560 Ananias¦89561 left and went¦89558 into Yudas' house¦89566 where he placed his hands¦89572 on Saul and said¦89575, “Brother Saul, the \nd master¦89579\nd* has sent¦89580 me here—\nd Yeshua¦89582\nd* the one you saw on the road¦89588 when you were coming¦89590 here—so that you will be able to see again and also be filled¦89595 with the holy \nd spirit¦89596\nd*.”
\v 18 Immediately something¦89600 like scales¦89609 fell off Saul's eyes¦89605 and he was able to see again, and he got up¦89616 and got immersed¦89618 in water,

\v 21 The hearers were all amazed¦89652, saying¦89660, “Isn't this the guy that persecuted¦89665 the ones following that Yeshua in Yerushalem¦89668, and even came to Damascus to arrest them here and take them back to the chief¦89688 priests¦89688?”
\p
\v 22 But Saul was growing stronger\f + \fr 9:22 \ft It's not clear here whether it means that Saul was growing physically stronger, or that his preaching and debating skills were improving.\f* and he was confounding¦89696 the Jews¦89698 living¦89700 in Damascus¦89702 as he taught¦89703 them that Yeshua is the \add promised\add* \nd messiah¦89708\nd*.

\rem /s1 Saul in Jerusalem
\p
\v 26 When he got back to Yerushalem¦89768, Saul attempted¦89770 to join in with the believers there but¦89775 they were all scared of him, not believing¦89780 that he was a true follower of Yeshua.
\v 27 However Barnabas¦89784 took Saul and brought¦89788 him to the twelve, and Saul told them how he had seen the \nd master¦89801\nd* on the road¦89798, and been spoken to by him, and how he had spoken boldly¦89810 in Damascus¦89809 in the name¦89813 and authority of \nd Yeshua¦89815\nd*.
\v 28 So¦89817 Saul stayed connected with the believers, going¦89823 in and out of Yerushalem¦89826 and speaking¦89829 boldly¦89829 in the name¦89832 and authority of the \nd master¦89834\nd*.
\v 29 He also talked and¦89838 debated¦89839 with the Greek-speaking Jews, but¦89846 they¦89845 wanted to kill¦89849 him¦89850,

\v 37 Around that time she¦90005 got sick and died. After washing her¦90009 body, they¦90010 placed it¦89998 in an upper¦90014 room,
\v 38 and since Yoppa¦90022 was near Lydda¦90018 and the believers had heard¦90025 that Peter¦90027 was there, they¦90031 quickly sent¦90031 two¦90032 men¦90033 to request, “Please come as soon as possible.”
\v 39 So¦90045 Peter¦90047 went¦90048 with them, and when they arrived¦90051 in Yoppa they took him up to the room. All the widows¦90063 stood¦90059 there, sobbing and showing¦90066 him various clothes¦90069 that Tabitha had made for them.
\v 40 But¦90106 Peter had them all removed from the room, and then kneeling down he prayed¦90096 before turning back to the body¦90101 and said¦90102, “Tabitha¦90103, get up.” Then¦90106 she opened¦90107 her¦90110 eyes¦90109, and seeing Peter there she sat¦90115 up.
\v 41 Peter helped her to stand up, then he called¦90124 the believers and the widows¦90130, and presented¦90134 the live Tabitha to them.
\v 42 News of this spread throughout¦90140 Yoppa¦90143 and¦90144 many people there believed¦90146 in the \nd master¦90150\nd*.

\rem /s1 Peter and Cornelius
\p
\v 1 Just up in Caesarea¦90170 there was a Roman army commander named Cornelius¦90172 (leader of the ‘Italian¦90180 Regiment’)
\v 2 who, along with all his household¦90189, worshipped God and obeyed his laws. He gave to the poor and regularly asked God for help.
\v 3 One afternoon around 3pm he had a vision¦90205 where he clearly¦90206 saw¦90203 one of God's messengers¦90214 come¦90217 into the house and call, “Cornelius¦90223.”
\p
\v 4 Cornelius was scared and looked¦90226 intently¦90226 and asked, “What is it, master¦90234?”
\p “Your¦90240 prayers¦90239 and your¦90240 helping the poor rose up to God's notice and attention,” he said.
\v 5 “Now, send some messengers to Yoppa¦90257 to go and find a man there named Simon¦90261 Peter¦90268.
\v 6 He's staying with Simon¦90273 the tanner¦90275 whose¦90276 house¦90279 is by the sea¦90281.”

\p
\v 9 The next day¦90322 as they were approaching the town, Peter¦90333 went¦90332 up onto the flat roof of the house¦90336 around midday to pray.
\v 10 But he felt hungry¦90345 and wanted something to eat, but¦90344 while it was still being prepared¦90349 he fell into a trance¦90359
\v 11 and saw the sky open up. Something like a sheet¦90372 was being¦90380 lowered down to the earth¦90383 by the four¦90374 corners¦90375
\v 12 and it held all kinds of animals and reptiles¦90397, as well as birds¦90402.
\v 13 Then¦90405 he heard a voice¦90407 saying, “Get up Peter¦90411, and slaughter these and eat¦90414 them.”
\p
\v 14 “I can't, \nd master¦90420\nd*,” Peter¦90417 responded¦90418, “because¦90421 I've never¦90422 eaten anything that's forbidden.”
\p
\v 15 But¦90429 the voice¦90430 spoke a second¦90435 time¦90435, “Don't you¦90442 be treating anything as unclean that \nd God¦90440\nd* has made clean¦90441.”
\v 16 This vision happened three¦90450 times and¦90451 then the sheet thing was lifted back up into the sky.
\p
\v 17 Now¦90493 Peter¦90469 was still there wondering what the vision¦90475 was all about when the men¦90481 sent¦90483 by Cornelius¦90487 had tracked down the tanner's house¦90491 and arrived outside.
\v 18 They called out to ask if Simon¦90503 Peter¦90506 was staying there.
\p
\v 19 Even as Peter¦90511 still continued to ponder¦90513 about¦90514 the vision¦90516, the \nd spirit¦90521\nd* said¦90517, “Hey, there's three¦90526 men¦90524 here looking¦90527 for¦90527 you¦90529.
\v 20 So get up and¦90534 go downstairs to them. Believe everything they say because¦90542 I sent¦90545 them here.”
\v 21 So¦90549 he went down and asked the men¦90555, “I'm the one you're looking¦90568 for, so tell me what you came here for.”
\p
\v 22 They answered, “We were sent by Cornelius¦90584 who's an army commander who worships \nd God¦90592\nd* and obeys his laws and has a good reputation with you Jewish people. A holy messenger¦90604 told him¦90611 to send¦90606 for you to come to his house¦90610 so they can listen¦90613 to what you have to say.”
\v 23 So¦90620 Peter invited them in to stay the night.
\rem /s1 Peter at Cornelius' House
\p The next day¦90626, Peter and¦90635 some of the believers¦90638 from Yoppa¦90642 started out with them
\v 24 and they arrived in Caesarea¦90656 the following day¦90648. Cornelius¦90659 was expecting¦90662 them and had also invited some relatives¦90667 and close¦90672 friends¦90673 to join them.
\v 25 Peter¦90683 entered the house and when they met, Cornelius¦90700 knelt down and worshipped him
\v 26 but¦90713 Peter¦90714 pulled him¦90717 up and said, “Stand up. I'm just a man like you.”
\v 27 After greeting each other, Peter went¦90735 into the main room and¦90739 found that quite a few people had gathered there.
\v 28 Then¦90745 he told them, “You all know that us Jews¦90756 are forbidden by our laws to associate with or to enter the house of a non-Jew. However, \nd God¦90769\nd* showed¦90771 me that it's not right to treat other¦90762 people as being¦90758 lesser or undesirable.
\v 29 That's why I came¦90781 without any reservations when you sent for me. But I'm still waiting to know what you all want from me?”
\p
\v 30 So¦90792 Cornelius¦90795 answered, “I was praying¦90816 in my¦90820 house¦90819 three days ago in the middle of the afternoon when I suddenly saw a man¦90823 in shining¦90830 clothes¦90829 standing in front of me
\v 31 and he said, ‘Your¦90836 prayer¦90839 has been heard, Cornelius¦90833, and \nd God¦90850\nd* has noticed your¦90836 gifts to the poor.

\v 33 I did that straight away and you kindly came here, so now we're all here in God's \add sight\add* to find out everything that the \nd master¦90919\nd* has commanded¦90913 you to say.”

\v 37 And you all know the news that started in Galilee¦90986 and spread through¦90977 all Yudea¦90980 after¦90987 the time of Yohan's teaching and ministry of immersion¦90989—

\v 45 The Jewish believers¦91165 who had come with Peter¦91171 were astonished that the gift¦91178 of the holy \nd spirit¦91181\nd* had been poured¦91184 out even on non-Jews¦91176
\v 46 as they¦91185 heard them speaking¦91188 in other languages¦91189 and¦91190 magnifying¦91191 \nd God¦91193\nd*. Then Peter¦91199 said,
\v 47 “Surely¦91200 no one could argue against them getting immersed¦91210 in water¦91202 now that they've received¦91218 the holy \nd spirit¦91215\nd* just like we¦91223 did?”
\v 48 So with the authority of \nd Yeshua¦91236\nd* the \nd messiah¦91237\nd*, he commanded¦91225 for them to be immersed¦91238 \add in water\add*. Then they¦91241 asked¦91241 him¦91242 to stay with them for a few more days¦91247.

\p
\v 1 Soon the missionaries and¦91257 other believers¦91260 in Yudea¦91268 heard¦91250 that non-Jews¦91273 had also accepted God's message¦91277,
\v 2 but when Peter¦91287 went¦91286 to Yerushalem¦91294, the strict Jewish believers were upset with him¦91329,
\v 3 saying¦91333 that he had gone into the home of uncircumcised¦91339 pagans and¦91342 \add even\add* eaten with them.
\p
\v 4 But Peter¦91350 started explaining¦91351 from the beginning,
\v 5 “I was staying in Yoppa¦91360, and as I was praying¦91362 I saw¦91364 a vision¦91367 of an object¦91370 like a sheet¦91373 coming¦91368 down, as if it was being¦91378 let down out of the sky by its four¦91375 corners¦91377. As it came¦91384 down to me
\v 6 I looked¦91390 at it and saw¦91393 animals, even wild animals, and reptiles¦91403 and birds¦91406.
\v 7 I also heard¦91410 a voice¦91413 telling me, ‘Peter¦91420, get up and slaughter these and eat¦91423 them.’
\v 8 But I said¦91424, ‘\nd Master¦91428\nd*, I can't because¦91429 I've never¦91435 eaten anything that's forbidden.’
\v 9 But the voice¦91445 from the sky spoke again, ‘Don't you¦91458 be treating anything as unclean that \nd God¦91456\nd* has made clean¦91457.’
\v 10 This happened three¦91465 times, and¦91466 then it was pulled¦91468 up again¦91469 into the sky.
\v 11 Next minute there were three¦91477 men¦91478 at the house¦91483 where I was staying \add saying\add* that they had been sent¦91488 from Caesarea¦91490 to fetch me,
\v 12 and the \nd spirit¦91498\nd* told me to go with them without questioning anything they said. These six¦91512 other believers¦91513 went¦91506 with me, and we¦91516 arrived at the house¦91519 of the man¦91521 \add who had sent the three\add*.
\v 13 He told us how he'd seen one \add of God's\add* messengers¦91529 standing there in his¦91533 house¦91532 and who'd told him¦91533, ‘Send \add someone\add* to Yoppa¦91541 to fetch Simon¦91545, the one called¦91547 Peter¦91548,
\v 14 and he will explain to you how you and all your¦91563 household¦91562 can be saved¦91557.’
\v 15 Then¦91565 when I started speaking¦91569 to them, the holy \nd spirit¦91574\nd* came down on them just like it had happened to us previously.
\v 16 That reminded¦91587 me of the words of the \nd master¦91593\nd* when he told us, ‘Yohan¦91596 immersed people in water¦91599, but you all will be immersed in the holy \nd spirit¦91604\nd*.
\v 17 Therefore¦91608 if God gave¦91612 the same¦91610 gift¦91611 to them that he'd given to us when we'd believed¦91620 in the \nd master¦91623 Yeshua¦91624\nd* the \nd messiah¦91625\nd*, what authority did I have to contradict God?’ ”
\p
\v 18 When the group heard¦91643 all this, they had no objections and they praised God, saying¦91653, “It seems that God has also allowed the pagans¦91658 to repent¦91662 and live.”

\p
\v 19 Over time, due to the persecution that began with Stephen's killing, the ones who had moved away went as far as Phoenicia¦91683, Cyprus¦91685, and Antioch¦91687, but they only shared Yeshua's teaching with other Jews¦91697.
\v 20 However, some of the believers were from Cyprus and Cyrene¦91707, and when they got to Antioch¦91712 they proclaimed the good¦91720 news from the \nd master¦91722 Yeshua¦91723\nd* to the Greeks.
\v 21 And the master caused their efforts to prosper, so a large number¦91734 of Greeks believed¦91736 and decided to follow the master.
\p
\v 22 News about this reached the assembly¦91749 in Yerushalem¦91753, so they¦91758 sent¦91758 Barnabas¦91759 to Antioch¦91763.
\v 23 When he arrived¦91766 and saw how God's grace¦91770 \add was spreading\add*, he was elated¦91774 and encouraged them all to earnestly continue to follow the \nd master¦91785\nd*.
\v 24 Barnabas was good¦91790 man¦91788 and full of the holy \nd spirit¦91793\nd* and full of faith¦91796 \add in God\add*, and a large¦91800 number of people decided to follow Yeshua.
\p
\v 25 So¦91805 Barnabas went¦91804 to Tarsus¦91810 to look for Saul¦91818,
\v 26 and when he found¦91822 him, he brought¦91825 him back to Antioch. Then¦91834 for a whole¦91839 year¦91838 they met with the assembly¦91844 and \add regularly\add* taught a large¦91849 crowd¦91848. It was there in Antioch that the believers were first¦91854 called Christians.
\p
\v 27 In those days¦91874, some prophets¦91878 from Yerushalem¦91877 went¦91875 to Antioch¦91880,
\v 28 and one of them named Agabus¦91895 when he was prompted by the \nd spirit¦91901\nd*, stood¦91889 up and predicted that the world¦91911 would experience a severe famine¦91902 (and this happened \add later\add* during¦91916 the reign of Claudius¦91917).
\v 29 The believers decided to send¦91935 assistance to their¦91932 fellow¦91941 believers who lived in Yudea¦91940—each one according to his means—
\v 30 and so they¦91946 did, sending their contributions with Barnabas¦91953 and Saul¦91955 to take to the elders¦91950.

\v 1 Around that time¦91961, King Herod¦91965 \add Agrippa\add* used his power to mistreat¦91971 some of the believers from the assembly¦91976,
\v 2 and he had Yacob¦91983, the brother¦91985 of Yohan¦91986, executed by the sword¦91988.
\v 3 Then¦91991 when he saw that it pleased¦91993 the Jewish religious leaders, he went on to seize Peter¦92006 during the \it Flat Bread Celebration\it*.
\v 4 After being arrested¦92016, Peter was put in prison¦92020 where he was guarded¦92027 by four squads¦92025 of four soldiers¦92026 each. After the Passover Feast, Herod planned to display Peter to the people¦92037,
\v 5 but while he was being¦92042 held in prison¦92045, those in the assembly¦92061 were earnestly¦92053 asking God¦92041 to help him.

\p
\v 6 Herod¦92079 planned to send for Peter later that evening, but meanwhile Peter had fallen¦92086 asleep¦92086 chained with two chains between¦92087 two soldiers¦92089. There were also prison¦92104 guards¦92093 at the door¦92100
\v 7 but one of the \nd master's¦92108\nd* messengers \add suddenly appeared\add* standing by Peter and light¦92113 radiated through the prison¦92118 cell. The messenger poked Peter in the side to wake him up, saying¦92128, “Quickly, get up!” The chains¦92137 fell off his¦92135 wrists
\v 8 and the messenger said, “Get dressed and put on your sandals¦92155,” so he did. Then¦92143 the messenger said, “Now put on your coat¦92165 and follow¦92168 me.”
\v 9 So¦92170 Peter followed¦92172 the messenger¦92185 out of the cell, not really knowing¦92176 if it was real or if he was still dreaming.
\v 10 They went past the first¦92193 guard¦92194 and then the second¦92196, and then came to the iron gate which led out of the prison into the city¦92209. The gate opened¦92212 by itself and they went out onto the street, then at the end of the street the messenger¦92231 suddenly left him.
\p
\v 11 By now Peter¦92236 was fully awake and said¦92242 to himself¦92240, “Now I know that the \nd master¦92250\nd* really did send his¦92253 messenger¦92252 to rescue¦92255 me from Herod¦92260 and from the plans of the Jewish leaders.”
\p
\v 12 Now that he realised this, he went¦92273 to Maria's¦92278 house¦92276 (the mother¦92280 of Yohan¦92281 Mark¦92285) where¦92286 many believers had met to pray.
\v 13 He knocked¦92292 at the door¦92299 in the fence and a servant¦92304 girl¦92304 named Rhoda¦92308 came out to see who it was.
\v 14 But¦92310 when she recognised¦92311 Peter's voice¦92313, she was so excited that she forgot about opening the door, but ran back inside to tell everyone that Peter was standing out there.
\v 15 They told her that she must be raving¦92343 mad, but she insisted¦92346 it was true, but they said¦92341 that it must be his¦92360 messenger¦92357.
\p
\v 16 Meanwhile Peter¦92363 continued¦92364 knocking¦92365, and when they eventually opened¦92367 the outer door, they saw¦92370 that it¦92367 was him¦92373 and they were amazed.
\v 17 But¦92401 Peter signalled them with his hand¦92382 to be quiet, and then he explained how the \nd master¦92394\nd* had led him out of the prison¦92399, and instructed them, “Tell this to Yacob¦92404 and the brothers¦92407.” Then¦92401 he left and went off to another¦92413 place¦92414.
\p
\v 18 Once daylight came, there¦92418 was pandemonium among¦92422 the soldiers¦92424 \add in the prison as they tried to figure out\add* what had happened to Peter¦92428.
\v 19 Then¦92432 when King Herod¦92430 sent for Peter and he wasn't there, the prison guards¦92440 were interrogated and then taken away to be executed.

\s1 The death of Herod
\p
\v 20 Now King Herod was disputing with the people of Tyre¦92460 and Tsidon, and so they got together and persuaded¦92478 Blastos¦92479, a close personal servant of the king, to be their¦92493 spokesman in asking for peace¦92489 because¦92490 they were dependent on food from the king's provinces.
\p
\v 21 On the agreed day¦92505, Herod¦92507 dressed¦92508 in his royal¦92510 garments and seated on his throne, started to address¦92516 them.
\v 22 The crowd shouted out, “This is the voice¦92529 of a \nd god¦92528\nd*, not of a man.”
\v 23 Because he didn't attribute the honour to \nd God¦92550\nd*, one the \nd master's¦92542\nd* messengers¦92541 immediately¦92536 struck¦92539 him down and he stopped¦92562 breathing¦92562 as a result of a worm infestation.
\p
\v 24 Meanwhile God's message¦92565 continued to spread and¦92571 multiply¦92572.

\s1 Sergius believes after Bar-Jesus is blinded
\p
\v 6 They travelled around the island¦92729 and when they got to Paphos¦92731, they met a Jewish man¦92735 named Bar-Jesus.\f + \fr 13:6 \ft The Greek form of his name was Elymas according to verse 8.\f* He was a sorcerer and false¦92739 prophet¦92739
\v 7 who was with Sergius Paulus the proconsul¦92753, an intelligent¦92757 man¦92756. Sergius sent for Barnabas¦92761 and Saul¦92763 because he wanted to hear¦92768 God's message¦92770 from them,
\v 8 but¦92774 the sorcerer opposed them and tried to prevent Sergius¦92776 from believing.
\v 9 So then Saul¦92796 (the \add Roman\add* form of his name was Paul¦92800), filled¦92801 with the holy \nd spirit¦92802\nd* looked¦92805 intently¦92805 at Bar-Jesus
\v 10 and said¦92808, “You're full of all kinds of deceit¦92812 and fraud¦92816 you child of the devil¦92819. Will you never stop twisting the truth about following the \nd master¦92829\nd*?
\v 11 Well, look here! The \nd master¦92839\nd* will extend his power against you and blind¦92844 you—you'll go a season¦92851 without seeing¦92846 the sun!”
\p And immediately¦92852 he could only see fog and darkness¦92864, and needed someone to guide him around¦92866 by the hand.
\v 12 The proconsul¦92873 believed¦92878 when he saw what had happened, and was amazed¦92881 as he learnt about the \nd master¦92888\nd*.

\v 13 After that, Paul\f + \fr 13:13 \ft From this point on in the text, Paul is referred to by his Roman name as his ministry is largely outside of Israel. (In Israel he seemed to be better known as Saul, the Greek form of his Hebrew name Sha-ul.)\f* and his companions sailed from Pafos¦92894 to Perga¦92901 in Pamfylia, but¦92905 Yohan¦92904 Mark left them and returned¦92909 to Yerushalem¦92912.
\v 14 Paul and his companions, went on from Perga¦92919 to Pisidian¦92927 Antioch¦92923, where they entered the Jewish¦92933 meeting¦92933 hall¦92933 on the Rest Day and sat¦92942 down \add with the congregation\add*.
\v 15 After the readings¦92946 from the Law and from the Prophets,\f + \fr 13:15 \ft The Hebrew Scriptures are divided into the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings.\f* the leaders¦92954 sent¦92952 a messenger over to them to ask, “Men, brothers¦92959, if you¦92967 bring any message¦92968 of encouragement for the congregation, please share it¦92973.”
\p
\v 16 So¦92975 Paul¦92977 stood¦92974 up and, motioning with his hand¦92981, started speaking, “Fellow Israelis and every who reveres¦92988 \nd God¦92990\nd*, listen¦92991 to me.
\v 17 The \nd God¦92993\nd* of the people of Israel¦92998 chose¦92999 our¦93002 ancestors¦93001 and helped the people to prosper when they were staying in Egypt¦93015. Then later he showed his power as he led them out
\v 18 and¦93024 endured¦93031 them in the wilderness¦93035 for around forty years.
\v 19 Then having¦93037 overthrown seven¦93039 nations¦93038 in Caanan,\x + \xo 13:19: a \xt Deu 7:1; \xo b \xt Josh 14:1.\x* he passed on that land as an inheritance
\v 20 after¦93061 around 450 years¦93056.
\p “Then¦93060 he gave¦93063 them judges¦93064 through until¦93065 the time of the prophet¦93068 Samuel¦93066
\v 21 when they¦93070 requested¦93070 a king¦93071, and¦93072 \nd God¦93076\nd* gave¦93073 them Saul¦93078, the son of Kish from the tribe¦93083 of Benyamin to reign for forty¦93086 years¦93085.
\v 22 After Saul was removed¦93088, God chose David to be their king¦93096—the man of whom he said, ‘I found¦93101 David the son of Jesse¦93106, a man who wants to obey me and do everything I ask.’
\v 23 Then eventually a descendant of David arrived in Israel¦93131 as promised¦93127—the saviour¦93133 \nd Yeshua¦93135\nd*.
\v 24 Before¦93137 he arrived Yohan-the-immerser had publicly¦93136 preached to all the people¦93147 of Israel¦93148 about being immersed¦93143 \add as a sign\add* of repentance¦93144.
\v 25 As Yohan's ministry was nearing an end, he asked, ‘Who do you suspect¦93162 I am? I'm not the messiah, but he will come after¦93170 me, and I'm not \add even\add* worthy¦93176 to undo his sandals¦93179.’
\p
\v 26 “Men, brothers¦93184, descendants¦93186 of Abraham¦93187 and¦93188 others here who revere¦93193 \nd God¦93195\nd*, the teaching about this salvation¦93202 has been sent¦93204 to us.
\v 27 The people of Yerushalem¦93210 and their \add religious\add* leaders didn't recognise this \add Yeshua\add*, but by their judgement¦93232 of him they¦93233 fulfilled¦93233 the words of the prophets¦93224 that are read every¦93227 Rest Day.
\v 28 Despite not finding even one charge against him worthy of death¦93237, they requested¦93244 Pilate¦93247 to execute him
\v 29 and when they had done all the things that \add the prophets\add* had written¦93264 about him, they took his body down from the stake¦93279 and placed it in a burial chamber.
\v 30 But \nd God¦93287\nd* brought him¦93289 back to life
\v 31 and his¦93316 followers who had come¦93299 to Yerushalem¦93306 from Galilee¦93304 saw him for several days¦93296 and now testify about this to the people¦93319.
\v 32 So¦93320 now we're preaching¦93323 this good¦93323 message¦93323 to you¦93322 that what God promised¦93329 to our ancestors¦93327
\v 33 has now been fulfilled¦93336 for our¦93341 descendants, now that \nd God¦93335\nd* brought \nd Yeshua¦93347\nd* back to life just like it's written¦93361 in the second¦93363 psalm¦93359:
\q1 ‘You are my¦93366 son;
\q1 today¦93370 I have borne you.’
\m
\v 34 God brought him¦93395 back to life, and he's never going¦93399 to return¦93400 \add to the grave\add* to decay¦93402. As God said¦93404,
\q1 ‘I will give David's faithful¦93412 devout¦93409 \add things???\add* to you¦93407 all.’
\m
\v 35 So¦93413 in another¦93417 psalm¦93417 God said,
\q1 ‘You won't allow your¦93424 devout¦93423 one to experience decay¦93426.’
\m
\v 36 This can't be David¦93427, because¦93429 after he'd served his own generation¦93431 as \nd God¦93435\nd* led him, he indeed died and was buried with his ancestors¦93442 and his body decayed¦93446.
\v 37 On the contrary, the one who \nd God¦93451\nd* raised¦93452 from the dead never experienced decay¦93455.
\v 38 So¦93457 brothers¦93462, let it¦93458 be known¦93456 to you all that your sins¦93470 can now be forgiven¦93468 through¦93464 this \add Yeshua\add*—the law of Mosheh was never able to offer you that.
\v 39 Everyone who puts their trust in \add Yeshua\add* is able to receive a clean record.
\v 40 But keep your eyes open in case something else the prophets¦93506 wrote might come¦93499 true:
\q1
\v 41 ‘Watch¦93507 you scoffers¦93509, and be amazed and die because¦93517 I'm doing¦93521 something special during your¦93526 time.
\q1 Even if someone¦93534 described¦93535 it clearly to you all, you still might not believe¦93532 it.’ ”
\p
\v 42 As they¦93548 left the meeting hall after¦93555 the service, the people invited them to speak again the following Rest Day.
\v 43 But¦93565 when they starting walking away, many people followed¦93569 after¦93578 Paul¦93578 and Barnabas¦93581, who then addressed¦93583 them and encouraged them to continue trusting in God's grace¦93592.

\v 44 So¦93608 on the following Rest Day, nearly everyone in the city¦93616 had gathered¦93617 there to hear¦93618 the message¦93624 from \nd God¦93629\nd*.
\v 45 But the Jewish religious leaders became very jealous¦93640 when they saw the crowds¦93637 and claimed that Paul's words had slandered¦93652 God.
\v 46 But Paul¦93658 and Barnabas¦93661 responded¦93662 boldly¦93653, “It was necessary¦93668 for God's message¦93673 to be explained in the meeting hall to all of \add the Jews\add* first¦93669. But since you are rejecting that teaching, you are all judging¦93684 yourselves¦93687 to be unworthy of living forever, so instead, we will \add now\add* share it with the non-Jews¦93697.
\v 47 Because¦93699 this is what the \nd master¦93704\nd* commanded¦93700 us:
\q1 ‘I have chosen you to be a light¦93710 for the pagans¦93712;
\q2 You will take salvation¦93718 to the end of the earth¦93722.’
\p
\v 48 When the non-Jews¦93727 heard that, they¦93728 were very happy and were praising the \nd master's¦93737\nd* message¦93734, and as many as were appointed¦93742 to \add receive\add* eternal¦93745 life¦93744 believed¦93739 \add it¦93724\add*.
\p
\v 49 So¦93749 from there, the \nd master's¦93753\nd* message¦93751 spread throughout the entire¦93756 region¦93758.
\v 50 But the Jewish religious leaders¦93773 incited¦93762 some prominent¦93769 women¦93766 from the meeting halls and some from the local city¦93775 government, and they then stirred¦93777 up persecution¦93781 against¦93782 Paul¦93784 and Barnabas¦93787 and had them expelled out of their¦93794 region¦93793.
\v 51 So Paul and Barnabas just left that place to face their own consequences, and continued on to Iconium¦93808.
\v 52 Meanwhile the believers \add back in Pisidian Antioch\add* were full of happiness and¦93816 of the holy \nd spirit¦93817\nd*.

\s1 Paul and Barnabas in Iconium
\rem /s1 In Iconium
\p
\v 1 A similar thing happened in Iconium¦93822. Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish¦93831 meeting¦93831 hall¦93831 and spoke in such as way that a lot of both Jews¦93833 and Greeks¦93845 believed¦93840.
\v 2 But those Jews who didn't believe got the non-Jews¦93873 emotionally stirred¦93862 up to oppose the believers¦93876.
\v 3 So¦93885 Paul and Barnabas ended up staying there for quite a while, and as they spoke boldly¦93890 for the \nd master¦93893\nd*, he himself confirmed his¦93901 grace¦93900 by enabling the two of them to be able to do miracles and amazing things.
\v 4 Nevertheless, the people¦93919 of the city¦93921 were divided¦93914—some agreeing with the \add strict\add* Jews¦93928, and others supporting the missionaries.
\p
\v 5 At one point, both the non-Jews¦93946 and the strict Jews and their¦93954 leaders got worked up enough to come in order to attack them and throw¦93957 rocks¦93957 to kill them.
\v 6 However, Paul and Barnabas found out about it and escaped to the Lycaonian cities¦93964 of Lystra¦93968 and Derbe¦93970 and the surrounding¦93973 region¦93973
\v 7 and¦93975 preached¦93977 the good¦93977 message¦93977 there¦93975.
\s1 A miracle in Lystra following by a stoning
\rem /s1 In Lystra and Derbe
\rem /s1 Paul and Barnabas in Lystra and Derbe
\p
\v 8 In Lystra¦94000 there was a man¦93997 sitting¦94005 there who had been unable to use his¦94011 legs since birth.
\v 9 He was listening to Paul speaking¦94024, when Paul looked¦94029 straight at him¦94031 and¦94034 realised that the man¦94017 had the faith¦94039 to be healed¦94041.
\v 10 So¦94063 in a loud¦94043 voice¦94045, Paul said¦94042, “Stand¦94055 upright on your¦94059 feet¦94058.” And the man sprang¦94069 up and was walking¦94072 around.
\v 11 The crowd¦94076 of people who saw what Paul¦94082 had done began to shout out in Lycaonian, “These two look like men¦94093, but they're really gods¦94090 who have come down to us!”
\v 12 They called Barnabas¦94103 ‘Zeus¦94104’ and called Paul¦94108 ‘Hermas¦94109’ since¦94111 he was the main speaker.
\v 13 And the priest¦94123 of Zeus¦94126 wanted to sacrifice¦94150 with the crowds¦94146, so he brought¦94142 bulls¦94135 and garlands¦94138 \add of flowers\add* to the city gates¦94141 from \add the temple\add* on the path to the city.
\p
\v 14 But when the missionaries Barnabas¦94156 and Paul¦94158 heard¦94151 what was going on, they tore their clothes \add in dismay\add* as they rushed¦94165 out into the crowd¦94170
\v 15 shouting, “Men, why are you doing¦94179 all these things? We are only humans¦94186 just like all of you. We were bringing you the good message about abandoning these useless¦94197 \add sacrifices\add* and turning¦94199 to the living¦94205 \nd God¦94203\nd* who made heaven¦94211 and the earth¦94214 and the sea¦94217 and everything in them.\x + \xo 14:15: \xt Exo 20:11.\x*
\v 16 In previous generations¦94228 he allowed¦94229 all the nations¦94233 to go their¦94237 own different ways¦94236,
\v 17 but he never left himself without¦94243 evidence of himself—sending good¦94249 rains¦94253 from heaven¦94250 to give you all fruitful¦94258 seasons¦94257 with food to fill \add your stomachs\add* and happiness to fill your hearts¦94264.”
\v 18 By saying¦94269 these¦94268 things, they¦94272 were eventually just able to restrain¦94272 the people from sacrificing¦94278 to them.
\p
\v 19 But some \add strict\add* Jews¦94304 came over from \add Pisidian\add* Antioch¦94296 and Iconium¦94301 and were able to persuade¦94309 the crowds¦94313. They threw rocks at Paul¦94330 \add to kill him\add* and dragged¦94332 his body outside¦94334 the city¦94336 \add gates\add* thinking¦94337 that he was dead.
\v 20 But¦94357 as the believers were standing around him, Paul got up and went back into the city¦94356, but¦94345 he left¦94361 again with Barnabas¦94364 the next day¦94358 and went to Derbe¦94366.

\rem /s1 The Return to Antioch in Syria
\p
\v 21 They preached¦94367 the good¦94367 message¦94367 in Derbe, and after giving further training¦94379 to many of them, they¦94383 returned¦94383 to Lystra¦94387 and Iconium¦94390 and Antioch¦94393.
\v 22 There they strengthened¦94394 the faith¦94405 of the believers—encouraging them to continue believing and¦94406 to expect that it's normal to endure a lot of suffering on the path to God's kingdom¦94418.
\v 23 They appointed some elders for \add each\add* assembly¦94426, then they fasted and prayed¦94428 for the elders—asking the \nd master¦94435\nd* that they believed¦94438 in to look after them.
\p
\v 24 After passing through¦94441 Pisidia¦94445, they¦94446 arrived at Pamfylia
\v 25 and¦94451 after teaching the master's message¦94459 in Perga¦94456, they¦94462 went¦94462 down to \add the coastal city of\add* Attalia¦94464.
\v 26 From there¦94467, they sailed¦94468 \add back\add* to \add Syrian\add* Antioch¦94470 where the congregation had prayed for God's grace¦94475 to be with them\x + \xo 14:26: \xt 13:3.\x* for the work they had just fulfilled¦94482.
\p
\v 27 So¦94484 when they arrived¦94483, they gathered¦94486 the assembly¦94489 together¦94486 there and shared about what \nd God¦94495\nd* had done with them and how he had opened¦94504 up the door¦94507 of faith¦94508 to the non-Jews¦94506.
\v 28 Then¦94510 they¦94509 stayed on with them there for quite a while.
\c 15
\s1 The decision from the Yerushalem elders
\rem /s1 The Meeting at Jerusalem
\rem /s1 The Council at Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 Then¦94518 some \add people\add* came \add to Antioch\add* from Yudea¦94523 and were teaching the believers¦94526 that according to Mosheh's teachings, you can't be saved¦94543 unless you've been circumcised¦94532.
\v 2 This led to no end of argument and debate¦94551 between them and Paul¦94555 and Barnabas¦94558 until it was decided that the two of them and some other¦94590 believers should go to Yerushalem¦94603 to ask the missionaries and the elders¦94601 there about¦94608 this issue.
\p
\v 3 So indeed¦94613 the assembly¦94618 sent¦94615 the group on their way, and as they passed through¦94619 Phoenicia¦94622 and Samaria¦94625, they described¦94627 how non-Jews¦94631 had become believers and this news made the believers there¦94614 very happy.
\p
\v 4 When they arrived¦94639 in Yerushalem¦94642, they were welcomed by the assembly¦94651 and the missionaries and the elders¦94657, and they explained how \nd God¦94664\nd* had used them.
\v 5 But some of the believers¦94688 who were also members of the Pharisee¦94687 party¦94687 stood up and said, “It's quite proper for them to be circumcised¦94692 and to be commanded¦94694 to keep the Jewish religious laws.”
\p
\v 6 So¦94703 the missionaries and¦94706 the elders¦94708 met separately in order to consider the matter¦94712 further.
\v 7 After a lot of debate¦94717, Peter¦94748 stood¦94744 up and said, “Men, brothers¦94754, all of you here know that some time back, \nd God¦94766\nd* chose¦94764 me to be a mouthpiece¦94772 so that the non-Jews¦94776 could hear the good message and believe¦94782.
\v 8 And \nd God¦94788\nd* who knows even people's inner thoughts, gave them the same holy \nd spirit¦94798\nd* that he gave us,
\v 9 and when he purified¦94814 their¦94817 minds by the faith¦94813, he didn't do anything different for them than he did for us.
\v 10 So¦94819 why are you¦94821 all provoking \nd God¦94823\nd* by putting a load on the shoulders of these believers that neither¦94832 we¦94837, nor our¦94835 ancestors¦94834, were ever able to bear?
\v 11 But we¦94848 ourselves have believed¦94848 thanks to the grace¦94843 of \nd Yeshua¦94846\nd* the \nd master¦94845\nd*, and they can be saved¦94850 in just the same way.”
\p
\v 12 The whole group sat in silence¦94864, and then they listened to Barnabas¦94872 and Paul¦94875 as they described everything that \nd God¦94882\nd* had done among¦94886 the non-Jews¦94888 through them, including miracles and amazing things.
\v 13 Then¦94892 while they were still silent¦94894, Yacob¦94898 responded, “Men¦94901, brothers¦94902, listen¦94903 to me.
\v 14 Simon Peter has told us how \nd God¦94910\nd* first¦94908 intervened in order to select a people¦94916 for himself from among the non-Jews¦94914.
\v 15 And this actually agrees¦94924 with the message¦94927 that the prophets¦94929 recorded,
\q1
\v 16 ‘After¦94932 these¦94934 things have happened I will return¦94936,
\q1 and I will rebuild the worship tent from David's time that has collapsed,
\q1 Although it was overturned¦94947, I will rebuild and restore¦94953 it,
\q1
\v 17 so that the remaining people¦94961 will want to find the master,
\q1 and also the non-Jews¦94968 who cried out to me.
\q1 The master who is doing¦94980 these¦94982 things is saying¦94977 this,
\q1
\v 18 and planned it this way from eternity¦94987.’
\p
\v 19 Because of this, my ruling is not to be troubling¦95002 the non-Jews¦95006 who are turning¦95007 back to \nd God¦95010\nd*,
\v 20 but to write¦95012 to them to keep away from anything polluted¦95018 by idols¦95020, from sexual¦95023 immorality¦95023, and from strangled¦95026 animals¦95026 and \add eating or drinking\add* blood¦95029.
\v 21 Mosheh's writings have been preached in every city¦95046 and are read in \add our\add* meeting¦95058 halls¦95058 on every Rest Day.
\s1 The letter is carried to Antioch
\rem /s1 The Letter for Gentile Believers
\rem /s1 The Letter to the Gentile Believers
\rem /s1 The Council's Letter to Gentile Believers
\p
\v 22 So the missionaries and elders¦95070 with all the assembly¦95074 decided to choose some men to accompany Paul¦95084 and Barnabas¦95086 to Antioch¦95081, so they chose¦95075 Yudas¦95087 (nicknamed Barsabbas¦95091) and Silas¦95094 who were leaders among¦95098 the believers¦95100,
\v 23 This is what they wrote¦95101: This letter is from the missionaries and elders¦95114, your brothers \add here in Yerushalem\add* to our non-Jewish fellow believers¦95117 in Antioch¦95121 and Syria¦95124 and Cilicia¦95127.
\v 24 Since¦95135 we heard¦95138 that some people who weren't sent by us came from here and disturbed¦95146 you all with their upsetting¦95149 messages¦95148,
\v 25 we unanimously agreed to select some men¦95168 to accompany our¦95176 dear \add friends\add* Barnabas¦95177 and¦95178 Paul¦95179 back.
\v 26 These are men¦95180 who have dedicated their¦95187 lives¦95185 to our¦95193 \nd master¦95192\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦95194\nd* the \nd messiah¦95195\nd*.
\v 27 So¦95200 we've sent¦95199 Yudas¦95201 and Silas¦95203 and they'll confirm in person what we are writing.
\v 28 It seemed right to the holy \nd spirit¦95216\nd* and¦95220 to us to not burden¦95229 you¦95228 all with anything more than the following commands:
\v 29 you all must keep away from anything sacrificed¦95236 to idols, from \add eating or drinking\add* blood¦95238 or strangled¦95241 animals¦95241, and from sexual¦95243 immorality¦95243. You will do well if you avoid these things. Farewell.
\p
\v 30 So¦95268 they were sent¦95269 off and when they arrived at Antioch¦95276, they gathered¦95278 the believers and handed¦95282 across the letter¦95284,
\v 31 and when they read it¦95285, they were very happy with the encouraging contents.
\p
\v 32 Yudas¦95291 and Barnabas¦95295 were both prophets¦95298, and said a lot to encourage them and strengthen¦95312 \add their faith\add*.
\v 33 After they'd stayed there¦95316 for a while, the believers¦95322 sent them home carrying greetings from them to the assembly \add back in Yerushalem\add*.
\p
\v 34 ◘
\v 35 But Paul¦95344 and Barnabas¦95347 stayed on there in Antioch¦95350, teaching¦95351 them and preaching¦95353 the good message along with many others¦95357.
\s1 Paul and Barnabas go separate ways
\rem /s1 Paul and Barnabas Separate
\rem /s1 Disagreement Between Paul and Barnabas
\p
\v 36 After a few days¦95366, Paul¦95372 suggested to Barnabas¦95371, “Let's go back and visit¦95376 the believers¦95378 in each city¦95383 where we proclaimed¦95389 the \nd master's¦95393\nd* message¦95391, and see how they're doing.”
\v 37 Barnabas¦95396 agreed and wanted to take¦95401 Yohan¦95405 Mark¦95409 along¦95401 with them as well,
\v 38 but¦95411 Paul¦95410 didn't want to take him because he had left them in Pamfylia¦95423 instead of continuing with them in their work.
\v 39 And so it turned into such a disagreement that the two of them each went their different ways. Barnabas¦95454 took Yohan Mark¦95459 with him and¦95453 sailed to Cyprus¦95464
\v 40 while Paul¦95465 chose¦95468 Silas¦95469 and they left¦95470 after being entrusted to the \nd master's¦95475\nd* grace¦95473 by the believers¦95480.
\v 41 They went through¦95481 Syria¦95486 and¦95488 Cilicia¦95491, strengthening¦95493 the assemblies¦95495 there.

\s1 Paul and Silas also take Timothy with them

\rem /s1 Paul's Second Missionary Journey
\p
\v 1 Then¦95503 Paul went to Derbe¦95510 and¦95511 then on to Lystra¦95513 where a believer named Timothy¦95522 lived. His mother was a Jewish believer, but¦95529 his father¦95528 was Greek¦95530.
\v 2 The believers¦95540 in Lystra¦95536 and¦95537 Iconium¦95538 spoke well of Timothy
\v 3 and Paul¦95544 wanted¦95542 him to accompany them on his trip so he circumcised¦95552 him \add in advance\add* because¦95555 of the Jews¦95557 in that region—everyone knew that his father¦95572 was a Greek¦95569.
\v 4 As they passed through¦95581 various towns, they explained the decision of the missionaries and elders¦95611 in Yerushalem¦95615 about which commands they must adhere to.
\v 5 So¦95618 the assemblies¦95619 were strengthened¦95620 in this way and¦95623 their numbers¦95626 were increasing each day¦95628.

\p
\v 6 From there, they¦95630 travelled through¦95630 Phrygia¦95633 and¦95634 the Galatia¦95636 region¦95637, after the holy \nd spirit¦95642\nd* prevented them from proclaiming the message¦95646 in Asia¦95651 \add Minor\add*.
\v 7 When they got to Mysia¦95657, they planned to go on into Bithynia¦95663, but \nd Yeshua's¦95674 spirit¦95672\nd* didn't let them,
\v 8 so after leaving Mysia¦95679 they¦95681 went¦95681 to Troas¦95683.
\v 9 During the night¦95690, Paul¦95693 had a vision¦95686 of a Macedonian man¦95696 standing there and imploring¦95705 him¦95706, “Come on to Macedonia¦95697 and help¦95714 us here.”
\v 10 So¦95718 as a result of the vision¦95722, we¦95729 decided to go straight to Macedonia¦95733, concluding¦95734 that \nd God¦95739\nd* had called¦95736 us to share the good message with them.

\p
\v 11 From Troas¦95756 we¦95757 sailed directly to Samothrace¦95759, and¦95762 then on to Neapolis the following¦95764 day¦95761.
\v 12 From there¦95770 we continued on to Philippi¦95774 which¦95775 is a \add Roman\add* colony¦95785 and the capital city of the Macedonia¦95783 district¦95781 where we stayed for several days.
\v 13 On the Rest Days, we went¦95803 \add down\add* to the river¦95810 outside¦95804 the \add city\add* gate where¦95811 we thought people might be praying, and we spoke to the women¦95826 who had met there.
\v 14 One of them was Lydia from Thyatira¦95835 who was a seller¦95832 of purple goods\f + \fr 16:14 \ft It's possible that Lydia dyed fabric and sold it, or that she actually made and sold the purple dye itself.\f* and although she already worshipped¦95836 \nd God¦95839\nd*, the \nd master¦95844\nd* opened¦95845 her¦95846 mind¦95847 and she readily accepted what Paul¦95853 was saying.
\v 15 So then Lydia and her¦95861 household were all \add ceremonially\add* immersed¦95856, and then she requested, “If you all consider me to be faithful¦95867 to the \nd master¦95870\nd*, come¦95872 and stay at my¦95878 place.” So she persuaded us.
\s1 Paul and Silas get thrown into prison
\rem /s1 In Prison at Philippi
\rem /s1 Paul and Silas in Prison
\p
\v 16 One time as we were walking to the prayer¦95891 meeting, we met a female slave who was possessed by a spirit¦95896 that enabled her to tell fortunes¦95913, and thanks to that, to earn a lot of money for her masters¦95909.
\v 17 She¦95919 walked along behind us and shouted out, “These¦95926 men¦95928 are slaves¦95929 of the highest¦95933 \nd god¦95931\nd* and they will be telling you¦95938 all how to be saved.”
\v 18 After she'd done this for several days¦95947, Paul¦95952 was so frustrated that he turned¦95954 around and spoke to the spirit¦95956 \add in her\add*, “I command¦95960 you by the authority of \nd Yeshua¦95965\nd* the \nd messiah¦95966\nd* to leave her.”
\p
\v 19 But when her¦95989 masters¦95988 realised that their¦95999 profitable business¦95998 was about to come to an end, they¦96010 grabbed Paul¦96006 and Silas¦96009 and dragged¦96010 them to the authorities at the marketplace¦96013.
\v 20 They brought¦96018 them forward¦96018 to face the magistrates and¦96017 said¦96023, “These¦96025 Jews¦96033 are disturbing¦96028 \add the peace\add* in our¦96030 city¦96032
\v 21 and¦96035 teaching behaviour that we as Romans can neither accept¦96045 nor practice¦96049.”
\v 22 An \add angry\add* crowd¦96057 gathered around and the magistrates ordered for Paul and Silas to have their¦96067 robes¦96069 torn off and then to be beaten with rods.
\v 23 They were severely beaten and then thrown¦96078 into prison where the officer was commanded¦96081 to keep them secure¦96086.
\v 24 Because of that, he threw them into the inner¦96102 cell and locked their¦96105 feet¦96106 in stocks¦96115.
\p
\v 25 Around midnight¦96120 Paul¦96125 and Silas¦96128 were praying¦96129 and singing¦96130 praises to \nd God¦96132\nd*, and the other prisoners¦96139 were listening¦96133 to them.
\v 26 Suddenly there was a strong earthquake¦96142 that shook even the foundations¦96148 of the prison, and immediately¦96156 all the prison doors¦96158 opened¦96151 up and the chains of all the prisoners came loose.
\v 27 The prison officer woke up, and when he saw that all the prison doors¦96176 were open, he drew his sword¦96183 to take his own life as he figured that all the prisoners must have escaped¦96190.
\v 28 But Paul¦96200 shouted out, “Don't harm yourself¦96204! We're all still here!”
\p
\v 29 The officer called for torches, then rushed¦96216 in and knelt down trembling¦96218 in front of Paul¦96226 and Silas¦96229.
\v 30 Then¦96230 he escorted them out and asked, “Masters¦96243, what do I need to do to be saved¦96249?”
\p
\v 31 “Believe¦96254 in the \nd master¦96258 Yeshua¦96259\nd*,” they replied, “then you and your¦96267 household¦96266 can all be saved¦96262.”
\v 32 Then¦96268 they explained the message¦96272 about the \nd master¦96275\nd* to him and all those in his¦96283 household¦96282.
\v 33 Even though it was still the middle of the night¦96293, he sponged their¦96297 wounds¦96298, and then him and his¦96309 household were all immersed¦96301 straight away.
\v 34 He took Paul and Silas up into his house¦96321 and gave them a meal, and his whole household were happy because they now believed¦96334 in \nd God¦96338\nd*.
\p
\v 35 The next day¦96340 the magistrates sent¦96344 officials¦96347 to tell the jailer to release Paul and Silas.
\p
\v 36 So¦96397 the officer told Paul¦96387, “The magistrates \add sent these officials\add* to order¦96394 that you two to be released.”
\p
\v 37 But Paul¦96406 responded, “You mean that after publicly¦96413 beating us Roman men¦96415 without a trial, they threw us into prison¦96423 and now they want to just quietly release us.”
\p
\v 38 So¦96438 the officials¦96443 reported¦96436 this back to the magistrates, and they were quite afraid¦96457 when they heard¦96460 that Paul and Silas were Roman \add citizens\add*.
\v 39 So¦96465 now they came to the prison in person, and appealed¦96474 to them, and escorting them out of prison themselves, asked them to please leave the city¦96498.
\v 40 So¦96509 after Paul and Silas left the prison¦96513, they went¦96515 to see Lydia¦96519 and after encouraging the believers¦96524 there, they left.

\p
\v 1 After travelling¦96536 through¦96536 Amphipolis¦96540 and Apollonia¦96543, Paul and Silas went¦96544 to Thessalonica¦96551 where¦96552 there was a Jewish¦96555 meeting¦96555 hall¦96555.
\v 2 Paul's custom was to attend at the local meeting hall on the Rest Day, so he did that, and for three weekends in a row he discussed¦96574 the scriptures¦96581 with them,
\v 3 showing them how that it¦96588 \add had been written\add* that the messiah would suffer¦96589 and be killed and come back to life, and then explaining, “This \nd Yeshua¦96601\nd* that I've been telling you¦96606 about is the messiah.”
\v 4 Some of them were persuaded¦96611 and joined¦96613 with Paul¦96615 and Silas¦96618, along with a big group of godly Greeks¦96627 and quite a few prominent women¦96632.
\p
\v 5 But some of the other Jews¦96645 were envious \add of them\add*, and enlisted some of the troublemakers from the marketplaces¦96652 to form a mob. They stirred up all the people, and looking¦96671 for¦96671 Paul and Silas so they could bring¦96674 them out, arrived at the house¦96669 of a man named Jason.
\v 6 But¦96681 when they realised that Paul and Silas weren't there, they dragged¦96683 Jason and some other believers¦96692 off to the city¦96695 leaders, shouting¦96696, “Those two men who've gone around upsetting¦96704 the whole world¦96703 have now come here as well
\v 7 and Jason has welcomed¦96711 them \add into his house\add*. They rebel against Caesar's decrees¦96718 and claim that \nd Yeshua¦96727\nd* is a rival king¦96722.
\v 8 They stirred up the crowd¦96733 and¦96734 the city¦96736 leaders with these¦96742 accusations,
\v 9 so the leaders collected a heavy fine from Jason¦96749 and the others, and then released them.

\p
\v 10 So¦96756 the believers¦96757 immediately¦96758 sent¦96763 Paul¦96766 and¦96767 Silas¦96769 off during the night¦96762 to go to Berea. In Berea they also attended at the Jewish¦96777 meeting¦96777 hall¦96777
\v 11 and this group were more upper-class than the congregation in Thessalonica¦96790. They eagerly accepted the message¦96794 and examined¦96801 the scriptures¦96803 every¦96799 day¦96800 to check if what was being taught matched what was written there.
\v 12 Because it did, many of the people believed¦96817 including quite a few of the prominent¦96829 Greeks.
\v 13 But when the Jews¦96846 from Thessalonica¦96845 found out that God's message¦96857 was also being proclaimed¦96852 by Paul¦96855 there¦96870 in Berea¦96851, they¦96866 soon turned up to agitate¦96871 and¦96872 stir the crowds¦96875.
\v 14 So¦96879 the believers¦96887 immediately¦96878 sent¦96885 Paul¦96884 off to the coast, but Silas¦96903 and Timothy¦96906 both stayed.
\v 15 The ones guiding Paul¦96914 took him to Athens¦96918 before they headed back with his instructions for Silas¦96938 and Timothy¦96941 to come¦96948 and join him again as soon as possible.
\s1 People of Athens like new ideas
\rem /s1 In Athens
\rem /s1 Paul in Athens
\rem /s1 Paul Preaches in Athens
\p
\v 16 While Paul¦96961 stayed in Athens¦96955 waiting for them, he was upset in his¦96965 spirit¦96964 as he observed¦96969 how idolatrous¦96970 the people were.
\v 17 So¦96976 while he stayed busy having discussions¦96974 with the Jews¦96981 and other worshippers¦96984 from the meeting¦96979 hall¦96979, he also spent time every¦96991 day¦96992 with anyone¦96975 who just happened¦96995 to be around in the marketplace¦96989.
\v 18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers¦97004 enjoyed discussing things with him, but¦97021 others just mocked him, “What does this babbler¦97016 want to talk about now?”
\p But others said, “Seems that he's talking¦97010 about strange¦97022 demons¦97023,” because¦97027 he was preaching¦97034 the good¦97034 message¦97034 about \nd Yeshua¦97029\nd* and coming back to life.
\v 19 So they grabbed him and brought¦97050 him to the Aries¦97048 Hill \add where the council sat\add* and asked, “Are we allowed to know¦97056 what this new teaching¦97067 that you're bringing is about?
\v 20 It seems that you¦97072 have some surprising¦97068 ideas for our¦97079 ears¦97078, so we¦97080 want to hear what it's all about.”
\v 21 (Everyone¦97100 in Athens and¦97093 even visitors¦97095 often took the opportunity¦97102 either to explain or to listen to any new things.)
\p
\v 22 So¦97113 Paul¦97115 stood¦97112 up in the middle of the gathering on the hill and spoke, “Men of Athens, I've noticed how you¦97129 all are very religious,
\v 23 because¦97132 as I was looking around and observing¦97135 your¦97139 objects¦97138 of worship, I even discovered an altar¦97142 that was inscribed¦97147, ‘To the unknown¦97148 \nd god¦97149\nd*.’ So¦97152 without knowing¦97153 it, you already worship this \nd God¦97149\nd* that I'm going to tell you about.
\v 24 This \nd God¦97162\nd* who created the earth and everything in it¦97171 is the \nd master¦97178\nd* of heaven¦97173 and earth. He doesn't live in man-made temples¦97182
\v 25 nor can he be repaired by any human¦97190 hands¦97189 and he doesn't need to be fed. \add On the contrary\add*, he's the one who gives life¦97204 and breath¦97206 and who gives us everything that we need.
\v 26 From one man he made every¦97216 nationality¦97217 that lives across all the earth¦97228 and designated¦97229 their boundaries¦97236 and their futures.
\v 27 He made them so that they would try to discover \nd God¦97245\nd*, and if they did search for him they might find him as he's not far from any one of us
\v 28 because¦97277
\q1 ‘We live in him and are moved¦97280 by him and exist through him.’
\m Even some of your own poets¦97295 wrote,
\q1 ‘We are all descended¦97301 from just one.’
\m
\v 29 So¦97304 since we are God's offspring, we shouldn't be putting gold¦97312 or silver¦97316 or stone¦97318 craftsmanship¦97320 in the same class as the divine¦97326.
\v 30 In fact \nd God¦97339\nd* overlooked¦97337 times¦97332 of such ignorance¦97334 in the past, but now he's informing everyone¦97350 and requiring them to repent¦97351
\v 31 because he's set a date for when he's going¦97359 to be fairly judging¦97360 the world¦97363. He's already appointed the judge who everyone can have faith¦97371 in because he brought¦97372 him back to life from the dead¦97378.
\p
\v 32 When they heard¦97379 about a dead¦97382 person coming back to life, some started mocking¦97385 but others¦97387 said¦97388, “We'd like to hear¦97390 more about this from you¦97391 another time.”
\v 33 So Paul¦97400 left¦97401 at that stage
\v 34 but¦97406 some people joined¦97408 with him¦97410 and believed¦97411, including Dionysius¦97415 who was a council member, a woman¦97421 named Damaris¦97423, and others¦97425 as well.

\p
\v 1 After¦97430 this, Paul left Athens¦97439 and travelled to Corinth¦97442.
\v 2 There he came across a Jew¦97446 named Aquila¦97448 who had been born in Pontus¦97449 but who had recently¦97452 moved from Italy¦97457 along with his¦97461 wife¦97460 Priscilla¦97459 because¦97462 \add Emperor\add* Claudius¦97466 had ordered all Jews¦97471 to leave Rome¦97475. So¦97443 Paul approached¦97482 them,
\v 3 and since they worked in the same¦97490 trade¦97490, he ended up staying with them and they worked together in their craft¦97505 of tent-making.
\v 4 On every¦97517 Rest Day, Paul debated in the Jewish¦97514 meeting¦97514 hall¦97514, and was persuading¦97528 both Jews¦97533 and Greeks¦97536.
\p
\v 5 However when Silas¦97547 and¦97548 Timothy¦97550 arrived from Macedonia¦97543, Paul¦97556 was able to devote his full time to the message¦97553—demonstrating to the Jews¦97560 that \nd Yeshua¦97565\nd* is the \add promised\add* \nd messiah¦97563\nd*.
\v 6 But¦97576 when they opposed¦97573 \add the message\add* and made false accusations, he \add publicly\add* brushed \add the dust\add* off his clothes¦97584\f + \fr 18:6 \ft In the culture, this was a demonstration that you're not responsible for their decision(s).\f* and said¦97586, “Your¦97591 future deaths are your own problem. I'm innocent \add of your guilt.\add* From now on, I'll going¦97605 to the non-Jews¦97604.”
\v 7 So¦97607 Paul left there¦97612, and went¦97613 to stay at the house of a man named Titos¦97623 Justus¦97624 who worshipped¦97625 \nd God¦97627\nd* and whose house was next-door to the meeting¦97634 hall¦97634.
\v 8 Krispo¦97635 the meeting¦97639 hall¦97639 leader¦97639 and all his¦97651 household¦97650 decided to follow the \nd master¦97645\nd*, and many of the Corinthians¦97655 believed¦97641 after they heard \add the message\add* and were immersed¦97659.
\p
\v 9 Then¦97672 the \nd master¦97674\nd* spoke to Paul¦97683 one night¦97676 in a vision¦97678, “Don't be afraid and¦97690 stay silent¦97692, but¦97688 keep¦97692 speaking¦97689 out
\v 10 because I am with you and no one can mistreat¦97704 you here because there¦97708 are many of my people¦97707 in this city¦97713.”
\v 11 So Paul stayed on for eighteen months¦97725, teaching¦97727 God's message¦97732 to the people there.
\p
\v 12 Then at the time when Gallio¦97735 was the proconsul¦97739 of Achaia¦97742, the Jews¦97746 united against Paul¦97754 and¦97756 brought a case to the tribunal¦97765 against him¦97761
\v 13 saying¦97768, “This man¦97775 is going against the law by persuading¦97774 people¦97777 to be worshipping¦97778 \add his\add* \nd God¦97780\nd*.”
\p
\v 14 But as Paul¦97784 opening¦97785 his mouth¦97787 to speak, Gallio¦97790 said¦97788 to the Jews, “I would have accepted this charge if it¦97798 was a serious wrong¦97800 or evil¦97804 crime¦97803 and would have listened to you¦97813 Jews.
\v 15 However, since it's a question¦97818 about¦97821 a message¦97822 and names¦97824 and your own law, you all can see to it yourselves¦97831 because I don't¦97836 want to get involved in judging things like that.”
\v 16 So¦97840 he sent them away from the tribunal¦97846,
\v 17 but¦97861 they¦97857 grabbed Sosthenes¦97854, the leader¦97856 from the meeting¦97856 hall¦97856, and beat him up right there in front of the tribunal¦97860. But¦97849 Gallio¦97866 took action to stop them.

\v 18 Paul¦97871 stayed on for quite a few days¦97875 after that, then he farewelled the believers¦97878 and went to Cenchrea¦97895 where he had his hair cut as was the custom for someone making a vow. Then¦97870 taking Priscilla¦97888 and Aquila¦97890 with him, he sailed towards Syria¦97884.
\v 19 When they arrived¦97902 at Ephesus¦97907, he left the other two there while he went into the Jewish¦97923 meeting¦97923 hall¦97923 and had a discussion¦97926 with the Jews¦97928 there.
\v 20 They asked him to remain¦97937 longer, but he¦97941 turned them down
\v 21 although as he gave his farewells, he said¦97947, “I'll come back here again if \nd God¦97966\nd* wills it,” then he sailed on from Ephesus¦97974.
\p
\v 22 When he landed at Caesarea¦97978, he went¦97985 \add to Yerushalem\add* and greeted¦97982 the assembly¦97984 there before continuing on to Antioch¦97987.

\s1 Apollos teaches in Ephesus and Corinth
\rem /s1 Ministry of Apollos

\rem /s1 Apollos in Ephesus and Corinth
\p
\v 24 Meanwhile a Jewish man¦98018 named Apollos¦98011 (who had been born in \add the city of\add* Alexandria¦98014) arrived¦98020 in Ephesus¦98022. He knew the \add Hebrew\add* scriptures¦98027 well
\v 25 and had been taught¦98050 about the \nd master's¦98040\nd* way¦98037. Being¦98061 a very enthusiastic person, he started teaching¦98050 about \nd Yeshua¦98055\nd*, even though he didn't know about being¦98042 filled with the spirit¦98044.\x + \xo 18:25: \xt 2:1-4.\x*
\v 26 So¦98063 Apollos started speaking¦98065 out boldly¦98065 in the Jewish¦98068 meeting¦98068 hall¦98068. Priscilla¦98074 and Aquila¦98077 listened to him, then asked to speak with him privately and explained¦98085 God's way¦98087 more accurately.
\v 27 Now Apollos wanted to go to Achaia¦98130, so the believers encouraged¦98132 him and sent a letter ahead of him to tell the believers there to welcome¦98138 him, so when he arrived¦98141 there, he was able to contribute¦98144 a lot to those who through God's grace¦98154 had also become believers.
\v 28 Apollos was \add also\add* able to thoroughly¦98159 refute¦98159 the arguments of the Jews¦98158 and used the scriptures¦98166 to show that \nd Yeshua¦98171\nd* is the \nd messiah¦98169\nd*.

\s1 Many filled with the spirit in Ephesus
\rem /s1 Paul's Third Missionary Journey

\p
\v 1 So¦98176 then while Apollos¦98181 was at Corinth¦98185, Paul¦98186 travelled through¦98204 the interior regions before arriving at Ephesus¦98214. He found some followers there,
\v 2 and asked them if they had received¦98230 the holy spirit when they had \add first\add* believed¦98231 \add in Yeshua\add*.
\p They replied, “We hadn't even heard¦98246 that there's¦98245 a holy spirit.”
\p
\v 3 “So¦98257 then what were you¦98258 immersed¦98258 into?” asked Paul.
\p “With Yohan's immersion¦98267,” they¦98259 answered.
\p
\v 4 Then¦98269 Paul¦98271 said, “Yohan¦98272 immersed people¦98278 \add in water\add* with an immersion¦98275 that went with repentance¦98276 \add from their sins\add*, but he told them to believe in the one who would follow him, that is to believe in \nd Yeshua¦98292\nd*.”
\p
\v 5 When the followers heard¦98293 this, they¦98296 were immersed¦98296 \add in water again, this time proclaiming their faith\add* in \nd Yeshua¦98302\nd* the \nd master¦98301\nd*.
\v 6 Then¦98308 Paul¦98314 placed his hands¦98316 on them \add and prayed\add* and the holy \nd spirit¦98321\nd* came¦98319 \add down\add* onto them and they started speaking in other languages¦98331 and speaking messages from God.
\v 7 There were about¦98340 twelve¦98341 men¦98339 in the group.
\rem /s1 Paul Ministers in Ephesus
\p
\v 8 So¦98344 Paul started going to the Jewish¦98349 meeting¦98349 hall¦98349 and for the next three¦98356 months¦98355 he boldly¦98353 discussed¦98357 and persuaded¦98359 them about God's kingdom¦98363.
\v 9 But as some of them refused to believe and became hardened¦98372 against his teaching and started telling everyone¦98393 that the \add Yeshua\add* way¦98377 was evil¦98375, Paul stopped teaching in the meeting hall and taught the followers at Turannos' school¦98398 instead.
\v 10 This went on for two¦98412 years¦98411 to the point that everyone in Asia¦98423 \add Minor\add*, whether Jews¦98434 or Greeks¦98438, heard the message¦98429 about Yeshua.
\s1 The power of the master's message
\rem /s1 The Sons of Sceva
\p
\v 11 And \nd God¦98448\nd* was doing¦98449 incredible miracles¦98440 through Paul¦98453
\v 12 such that even if handkerchiefs¦98465 or aprons¦98468 that had touched his¦98464 skin were placed on top of any person who was sick or troubled with demons, then they would recover and the evil¦98479 spirits¦98477 would leave them.
\v 13 But some of the Jewish exorcists¦98494 going¦98491 around¦98491 attempted¦98484 to use the name¦98504 of Yeshua to drive out evil¦98502 spirits¦98500 by telling them, “I am imploring¦98511 you¦98512 all by Yeshua that Paul¦98519 preaches about.”
\v 14 Seven sons¦98536 of the Jewish chief¦98533 priest¦98533, Sceva¦98529 were doing¦98541 this.
\p
\v 15 But the evil¦98578 spirit¦98576 would answer¦98572 them saying, “I know \nd Yeshua¦98583\nd* and¦98585 I recognise¦98588 Paul¦98587, but¦98590 who are you¦98589?”
\p
\v 16 Then¦98593 the man¦98601 who had the evil¦98610 spirit¦98608 would jump on them and beat them up so they'd end up escaping¦98625 out of the house¦98629 naked¦98622 and wounded¦98624.
\v 17 When everyone in Ephesus¦98643 heard about this, both Jews¦98636 and Greeks¦98639 were frightened, and the name¦98656 of \nd Yeshua¦98659\nd* the \nd master¦98658\nd* was being¦98654 honoured.
\v 18 Many of the people who believed¦98664 \add in Yeshua\add* came and confessed¦98667 \add their¦98672 sins\add* and wrong practices¦98671.
\v 19 Lots of the people who'd practiced¦98680 magic¦98679 brought¦98681 their¦98683 scrolls¦98684 and burnt them in front of the others. When the values of all of these were added up, it was \add huge\add*—worth around 50,000 silver¦98695 \add coins\add*.
\v 20 So that was how the \nd master's¦98708\nd* message¦98711 had a powerful¦98700 effect and¦98713 won over many people.

\p
\v 21 After all of this, Paul¦98724 decided in his \nd spirit¦98728\nd* that he would need to travel through¦98729 Macedonia¦98732 and Achaia¦98735 enroute to Yerushalem¦98740, saying, “After I've been there¦98747 a while, I will also need to go to Rome¦98751.”
\v 22 He sent¦98754 two¦98759 of his workers, Timothy¦98766 and Eratos, to Macedonia¦98758 while he stayed on a bit longer in Asia¦98777 \add Minor\add*.

\p
\v 23 But¦98780 while he was still there, a major disturbance¦98785 hit the Yeshua followers.
\v 24 A silversmith¦98796 named Demetrius¦98791 made \add little¦98810\add* silver¦98800 shrines of Artemis¦98802 and this business¦98811 brought a tidy profit to the local craftsmen¦98807.
\v 25 Demetrius gathered all the workers¦98822 together¦98814 and told them, “Men, you¦98830 all know that our prosperity¦98837 comes from this business¦98835 of ours.
\v 26 But¦98841 you've seen yourselves and heard from others that not only Ephesus¦98852, but almost¦98855 our entire¦98842 \add province of\add* Asia¦98858 \add Minor\add* has become¦98878 persuaded¦98864 by this Paul¦98860 fellow, and now the crowds¦98868 are saying¦98869 that what we make are not \add real\add* gods¦98874.
\v 27 However it's not only us and our trade¦98889 that is coming into disrepute¦98893, but¦98882 the temple¦98903 of the great goddess¦98900 Artemis is considered to be useless. This could result in a loss of power for the great Artemis that all of Asia¦98925 \add Minor\add* and the inhabited¦98928 world¦98928 have been worshipping¦98929.”
\p
\v 28 When the gathering heard¦98931 this, they¦98942 became very angry and¦98934 yelled out, “Artemis¦98946 of the Ephesians is great!”
\v 29 Then¦98948 the \add whole\add* city¦98953 was filled¦98949 with confusion¦98956 and the people rushed¦98958 to the theatre¦98964 and grabbed Gaius¦98967 and Aristarchus¦98969 from Macedonia¦98970—travelling¦98972 companions¦98972 of Paul's¦98974.
\v 30 Now Paul¦98976 wanted to go there and speak to the crowd, but¦98978 the believers wouldn't let him¦98988 go.
\v 31 Also some of the leaders from Asia \add Minor\add* who were friendly¦99000 towards him, sent¦99001 messengers to him to implore¦99004 him not to go to the theatre¦99011.
\v 32 Some of the people gathered there were yelling out something, but overall it was just confusion, and¦99025 the majority of the people couldn't even tell you the reason why they¦99034 were there.
\v 33 Some people in the crowd¦99038 selected Alexander¦99042 the Jew and sent him forward¦99043 to speak, so he motioned with his hand¦99055 ready to explain the situation to the people.
\v 34 But as soon as they recognised¦99062 that he was a Jew¦99066, people started yelling, “Artemis¦99082 of the Ephesians is great,” and this continued for over two¦99077 hours¦99076.
\p
\v 35 Eventually the city¦99113 administrator was able to calm the crowd¦99094 and tell them, “Men, fellow Ephesians, what person from around here doesn't know that it's Ephesus¦99100 that's the temple¦99114 keeper¦99114 of the great¦99119 Artemis¦99121 and of this image¦99124 that fell down from Zeus?
\v 36 Since all of this is unquestionable¦99125, it¦99131 makes sense for everyone to calm down and¦99135 not do anything reckless¦99137.
\v 37 These men¦99143 that you¦99140 presented here haven't stolen anything from the temple¦99148, nor have they slandered¦99151 our¦99155 goddess¦99153.
\v 38 So if Demetrius¦99160 and the silver craftsmen¦99168 with him¦99167 have a case against anyone¦99172, they should¦99180 bring it to the courts¦99175 and the proconsuls¦99178 and register the charges.
\v 39 But for the rest of you, if you have a grievance against others¦99183, it¦99198 needs to be settled¦99198 in a lawful¦99195 assembly¦99197
\v 40 because¦99200 we're in danger¦99201 of being charged with insurrection¦99204 about what happened today¦99207. And we would have no defence that we could respond with concerning this disorderly¦99222 gathering¦99222.” Then¦99224 he told them all to go home.

\p
\v 1 After all the commotion¦99235 had died down, Paul¦99239 sent¦99236 for the believers, and after¦99230 greeting¦99247 and encouraging them, he left¦99249 \add Ephesus\add* to go to Macedonia¦99254.\f + \fr 20:1 \ft As he'd already decided—see 19:21.\f*
\v 2 As he travelled through¦99255 the districts¦99259, he challenged the people there with a lot of messages, until he eventually arrived in Greece¦99271.
\v 3 He'd been there about three¦99276 months¦99275 when he heard about a plot by some Jews¦99285 to waylay him as he boarded a ship to return to Syria¦99292, so instead he decided to return through¦99303 Macedonia¦99305
\v 4 with Sopater¦99317 son of Pyrrhus¦99318 from Berea, Aristarchus¦99322 and Secundus¦99324 from Thessalonica¦99320, Gaius¦99326 from Derbe, Tychicus¦99335 and Trophimus¦99337 from the province of Asia¦99332 \add Minor\add*, and Timothy¦99330 all accompanying¦99306 him¦99311.
\v 5 They went ahead and waited for us\f + \fr 20:5 \ft Luke (the writer) includes himself here.\f* at Troas¦99346.
\v 6 So¦99348 we sailed¦99349 out from Philippi¦99356 after the \it Flat Bread Celebration\it*. We arrived and meet the others there at Troas¦99363 after a five-day trip, and then stayed¦99374 on there for seven¦99376 days.

\v 7 On the Sunday we had gathered¦99385 together to break¦99390 bread¦99391 together and Paul¦99393 was discussing¦99394 many things with them. As he was scheduled to leave the next day, the meeting went on towards midnight¦99405
\v 8 and there¦99406 were many lamps¦99409 in the upper¦99413 room where¦99414 we¦99415 had all gathered¦99417.
\v 9 Now there was a young¦99422 man¦99422 named Eutychus¦99424 who was sitting¦99418 on the window¦99428 sill, and as Paul¦99437 went on, he fell asleep and toppled down from the third¦99448 storey. The ones who reached him first thought he was dead¦99453,
\v 10 but¦99455 Paul¦99457 had come¦99454 downstairs and bent over Eutychus and held him in his¦99473 arms and said¦99467 to the crowd, “Don't worry, he's still alive.”
\v 11 Then¦99478 Paul went¦99494 back up and broke¦99480 the bread¦99482 with the others, eating a little and continuing to talk with them until¦99490 leaving at daybreak¦99491.
\v 12 The locals took the young man home and¦99504 were very relieved that he was alive.

\v 13 We went ahead to the ship¦99516 and departed for Assos¦99521 where it had been arranged that we'd pick up Paul¦99526 because¦99528 he wanted to walk there¦99522.
\v 14 So¦99539 when we met him at Assos¦99547, he boarded the ship and we all sailed on to Mitylene¦99552.
\v 15 After we left Mitylene, we were out from Kios the next day, in Samos¦99567 the day after that, and then the following day we arrived at Miletus¦99578.
\v 16 Paul¦99583 had decided to sail¦99584 past Ephesus¦99586 because¦99600 he was hurrying¦99599 to try to get the Yerushalem¦99614 for the Day of Pentecost so he didn't want to spend¦99593 time¦99593 in Asia¦99598 \add Minor\add*.

\rem /s1 Paul Speaks to the Ephesian Elders

\p
\v 17 So¦99617 while we were at Miletus¦99619, he sent¦99620 a message to Ephesus¦99622 for the elders¦99626 of the assembly¦99628 to come to him.
\v 18 When they arrived¦99631, he told them, “You all know that from the very first¦99647 day¦99648 that I set foot¦99652 in Asia¦99655 \add Minor\add* and for the entire¦99643 time¦99669 that I was there
\v 19 I humbly served the \nd master¦99674\nd* even through tears¦99682 and trials¦99684 when the Jews¦99693 plotted to destroy me.
\v 20 But I didn't shrink back from teaching you everything that would help you, whether I was teaching in public¦99707 or in individual homes¦99710.
\v 21 I explained to both Jews¦99715 and Greeks¦99718 how they needed to turn their backs on their sins and towards \nd God¦99722\nd* with faith¦99725 in our¦99733 \nd master¦99731 Yeshua¦99734\nd* the \nd messiah¦99736\nd*.
\p
\v 22 However the \nd spirit¦99745\nd* is now forcing me towards Yerushalem¦99748 even though I don't¦99758 know what will happen to me there.
\v 23 I just know that recently in every¦99768 city¦99770, the holy \nd spirit¦99764\nd* tells me that chains and¦99779 hardships are waiting for me.
\v 24 But I've never regarded my own life as being valuable—I only want to reach the end of my life having served in the way that the \nd master¦99824 Yeshua¦99825\nd* instructed me to speak out the good message¦99831 about God's grace¦99833.
\p
\v 25 So¦99836 you see, I know that all of you from here where I passed¦99854 through¦99854 proclaiming¦99855 God's kingdom¦99857, you will never see me again.
\v 26 That's why I'm declaring to all of you¦99866 today¦99870 that I'm not guilty of your judgement
\v 27 because¦99882 I didn't avoid telling you¦99894 anything that I had from \nd God¦99892\nd*.
\v 28 So now you elders look after your own lives and those of your flock¦99902 because the holy \nd spirit¦99907\nd* chose you as overseers¦99912 to shepherd¦99913 the assembly¦99915 of God's people who he paid for with his very own blood¦99926.
\v 29 I'm aware that after¦99936 I leave, vicious wolves¦99941 will come in amongst¦99943 you¦99944 and trying to steal the flock¦99948.
\v 30 Even some of you¦99951 will rise up and¦99949 teach a message that's warped but which will draw some of the believers away to follow it,
\v 31 so take great care. Remember that for three¦99969 years, I never stopped warning each of you along with my tears¦99978
\v 32 so now I am leaving you all in God's hands and with the message¦99995 of his¦99998 grace¦99997 which¦99999 is quite capable of helping you grow to receive the inheritance¦100008 that's for all those who've been purified.
\p
\v 33 I never envied anyone's gold¦100020 or silver¦100017 or \add fancy\add* clothes¦100022
\v 34 and you¦100028 yourselves¦100026 know that I laboured with my own hands¦100044 to cover my expenses and for those with me.
\v 35 Yes, I showed¦100050 you all that it's good to work and to take care of the weaker ones and to remember¦100060 the message¦100063 of the \nd master¦100065 Yeshua¦100066\nd* when he said¦100070 that it's better to be a giver than a taker.”
\p
\v 36 When he'd finished speaking, Paul knelt¦100083 down and prayed¦100090 with them all.
\v 37 Everyone¦100105 was sobbing as they¦100106 hugged and¦100099 kissed him¦100107
\v 38 because what he had said about never seeing him again had really distressed¦100108 them. Then¦100127 they accompanied¦100126 him to his¦100124 ship¦100132.

\p
\v 1 When it¦100136 was time for us to sail, we¦100152 left them and sailed directly across to Cos¦100155 before going on to Rhodes¦100163 the next day¦100157 and then on to Patara¦100166.
\v 2 From there we found¦100170 a ship¦100171 heading to Phoenicia¦100174, so we boarded¦100175 that and set off.
\v 3 After sighting Cyprus¦100181 and then leaving it¦100184 behind on our left, we sailed on to Syria¦100188 and docked there¦100194 at the port of Tyre¦100193 where the ship¦100198 had cargo¦100202 to be unloaded¦100200.
\v 4 We searched for the believers there¦100210 and then stayed on with them for seven¦100212 days¦100211. They were inspired by the \nd spirit¦100220\nd* to tell Paul¦100215 not to go to Yerushalem¦100227.
\v 5 Once our time was up there and everyone knew that we¦100237 were leaving, even the wives¦100242 and children¦100244 accompanied¦100238 us out of the city¦100248 to the port. We all knelt¦100250 on the beach and prayed¦100258
\v 6 before we continued on and boarded our ship¦100270 and they went¦100266 back to their¦100275 own homes¦100276.
\p
\v 7 So¦100278 we sailed from Tyre¦100283 down to Ptolemais¦100287 where we were able to greet¦100290 the brothers¦100292 and sisters¦100292 and stay overnight with them.
\v 8 The next day¦100299 we continued on to Caesarea¦100311 and ended up in Philip's house¦100316. He was one of the \add original\add* seven¦100324 \add men who had been given the responsibility of distributing aid\add*—a preacher¦100319 of the good¦100319 message¦100319, and we stayed with him¦100327.
\v 9 Philip had four¦100334 unmarried daughters¦100332 still at home, and they shared messages from God.
\v 10 Several days¦100341 later a man named Agabus¦100350 came¦100343 from Yudea¦100347. He too shared messages from God
\v 11 and when he arrived, he picked up Paul's belt and tied it around his own feet and hands, telling them that the holy \nd spirit¦100380\nd* had told him that this is how the owner of the belt would be treated by the Jewish leaders in Yerushalem¦100394 before they would then hand him over to the non-Jews¦100404 to be dealt with.
\p
\v 12 When we heard¦100407 this described, both we and the locals¦100415 begged Paul not to go to Yerushalem¦100424
\v 13 but he answered¦100426, “Oh come on, what's all this weeping¦100438 and carrying on that's breaking¦100441 my¦100442 heart¦100444. Actually I'm quite ready¦100457 not only to be tied up, but even to be killed in Yerushalem¦100456 as a testimony to the \nd master¦100465 Yeshua¦100466\nd*.”
\p
\v 14 When we saw that we couldn't change his mind, we didn't say anything else, figuring out that whatever the \nd master¦100478\nd* wills for the situation would happen,
\rem /s1 Paul Arrives at Jerusalem
\v 15 and so after¦100486 these¦100491 several days¦100490, we¦100497 had gotten everything ready and started off for Yerushalem¦100501.
\v 16 Some of the believers from Caesarea¦100509 accompanied us and led us to the home of a man named Mnason¦100517 to stay—he was an older believer from Cyprus¦100520.

\p
\v 17 When we arrived at Yerushalem¦100527, the brothers¦100533 and¦100533 sisters¦100533 there happily welcomed¦100529 us,
\v 18 and the next day¦100534, we accompanied Paul¦100543 to go and see Yacob\f + \fr 21:18 \ft Yacob is commonly (but wrongly) called James in most older English Bibles.\f* and the elders¦100552 of the assembly there.
\v 19 After greeting¦100556 them, Paul then described all the things that \nd God¦100572\nd* had done among the non-Jews¦100575 as he had served among them,
\v 20 and when they'd heard¦100582 all that they praised¦100583 \nd God¦100586\nd* and told Paul, “Brother, you've noticed how many thousands¦100596 of Jews¦100601 have believed¦100605 \add in the messiah\add* but they still strive to observe¦100593 \add Mosheh's\add* laws.
\v 21 But¦100614 they've heard reports that you've been teaching¦100619 the Jews¦100628 that live outside our country that they don't have to obey what Mosheh \add wrote\add*—telling them that they don't have to have their¦100635 children¦100636 circumcised¦100633 and that they don't have to follow our \add Jewish\add* customs¦100641.
\v 22 What will happen \add now\add*, because \add the leaders here\add* will certainly hear¦100653 that you¦100656 have arrived?
\v 23 So¦100658 here's what we¦100662 suggest that you¦100661 do: Four of our men are making a \add public\add* vow.
\v 24 Why don't you join these¦100672 four and join them in the purification¦100674 ceremony \add at the temple\add* and pay their expenses in getting your heads shaved. Then everyone will be able to see that it's false what they've heard about¦100698 you, because you \add clearly\add* still comply with \add Mosheh's\add* instructions¦100697.
\v 25 And as for the believers¦100717 who are non-Jews¦100718, we've informed them of our recommendation that they should avoid anything that's been offered to an idol¦100742, avoid consuming blood¦100745 and meat from strangled¦100747 animals¦100747 and birds, and avoid sexual¦100749 immorality¦100749.”
\rem /s1 Paul Is Arrested
\p
\v 26 So the next day¦100759 Paul¦100752 took the \add four\add* men¦100755 for the purification¦100762 ceremony in the temple¦100767 and there they announced¦100768 the date when their vows would be fulfilled¦100770 and their sacrifices made.

\p
\v 27 When the seven¦100791 days¦100793 \add of the vow\add* were almost over, some Jews¦100802 from \add the province of\add* Asia¦100801 \add Minor\add* noticed Paul in the temple¦100808. They stirred up the crowd¦100818 and grabbed hold of him,
\v 28 yelling out, “Men of Israel. Help us here. This is the man¦100838 who's been teaching¦100856 all around the world against Israel and against \add Mosheh's\add* law and against this temple. What's more he brought¦100861 non-Jews here into the temple and so has defiled¦100868 this holy place.”
\v 29 (\add They said this\add* because¦100874 they had previously¦100876 seen¦100876 Trofimus¦100877 from Ephesus¦100879 in the city¦100882 with Paul¦100894 and had assumed that he had brought¦100892 him into the temple¦100891.)
\p
\v 30 So¦100896 now the whole¦100899 city¦100898 was in an uproar, and the crowds rushed in, grabbed Paul¦100908, and dragged¦100909 him¦100910 out of the temple and hurriedly closed the temple gates.
\v 31 They were ready to kill¦100926 Paul, but the commander¦100930 of the Roman soldiers had heard that all Yerushalem¦100937 was in an uproar.
\v 32 Taking some soldiers and officers, he immediately¦100939 ran down to the temple, and when the crowd saw the commander¦100953 and the soldiers they stopped beating Paul¦100961.
\v 33 The commander¦100966 came close and took¦100967 hold of Paul and ordered that he be tied up with a pair of chains¦100972 while he tried to find out who he was and what he'd done wrong.
\v 34 Various people in the crowd¦100993 were shouting out different things, and not being able to make any sense of it because¦101003 of all the commotion¦101005, the commander¦101006 ordered that Paul be taken into the barracks¦101011.
\v 35 When they got to the stairs¦101018, the soldiers¦101026 had to lift him¦101023 up above their heads because¦101027 of the frenzy of the crowd¦101032,
\v 36 because¦101034 most of the people¦101038 were following¦101033 and shouting out, “Do away with him¦101043!”
\s1 Paul's defence
\rem /s1 Paul Speaks to the Crowd; Paul Defends Himself
\p
\v 37 As they were able to carry him into the fortress, Paul¦101051 called down to the commander, “Can I say¦101061 something¦101062 to you¦101064?”
\p “You speak Greek!”, replied the commander.
\v 38 “Aren't you¦101072 the Egyptian who stirred up a group of assassins¦101091 a while back and led them out into the wilderness¦101086?”
\p
\v 39 “No, I'm a Jew from Tarsus¦101103 in Cilica—a citizen¦101111 of an important city¦101110,” said¦101092 Paul¦101095. “But please, let me speak¦101119 to these people¦101122.”
\p
\v 40 The commander nodded, so the soldiers stood¦101132 Paul on the stairs¦101135 where he gestured¦101138 to the people¦101143. The crowd quietened down, and so Paul spoke loudly in his¦101124 Hebrew¦101156 language¦101157:
\c 22
\nb
\v 1 “Men, brothers¦101160, and¦101161 fathers¦101162, listen¦101163 to what I have to say for myself.”
\v 2 When they heard¦101171 him speaking Hebrew¦101175, they became even more quiet¦101182 as he continued,
\v 3 “I am a Jew who grew up in this very city¦101204 to study under Gamaliel¦101209. I've been raised according¦101213 to every part of our¦101215 ancestral¦101216 law, working hard to obey \nd God¦101221\nd* like all of you¦101225 here today¦101228.

\v 8 ‘Who are you, master¦101340?’ I answered¦101335. And the voice said¦101341, ‘I am \nd Yeshua¦101350\nd*—the one from \nd Nazareth¦101352\nd* that you are persecuting¦101355.’
\v 9 The other¦101370 people with me saw¦101364 the light¦101363 but didn't hear the voice¦101371 that spoke to me.
\v 10 Then¦101379 I asked, ‘What do I need to do, master?’ ‘Get up and continue into Damascus¦101392,’ the master said. ‘When you get there¦101393, you'll be told everything that you've been assigned to do.’
\v 11 But I couldn't see anything because¦101409 the brightness of the light¦101413 \add had affected my eyes\add*, so my companions had to lead me by hand¦101415 into Damascus¦101423.
\p
\v 12 “In Damascus there was a man¦101427 named Ananias¦101424—a \add non-Jew\add* but who was respected by the Jews¦101439 there because he strove to obey \add Mosheh's\add* instructions about living¦101438.
\v 13 Ananias came to where I was and standing by me said¦101446, “Brother Saul¦101448, receive¦101450 your sight¦101450?” That very hour¦101454 I was able to see again and look at him¦101458
\v 14 and he said¦101461, ‘The \nd god¦101463\nd* of our¦101466 ancestors¦101465 has decided in advance to reveal his¦101473 plans to you, and for you to see¦101475 the sinless one—to hear¦101479 him speaking
\v 15 because he wants you to inform people¦101491 everywhere what you've seen¦101494 and heard¦101496.
\v 16 So¦101497 what else are you waiting¦101500 for? Get up and wash away your¦101507 sins¦101506 by getting immersed¦101502 \add in water\add* as you request his¦101513 forgiveness.’

\p
\v 17 “Then¦101515 when I returned¦101517 to Yerushalem¦101519 and¦101520 was praying¦101521 in the temple¦101525, I fell into a trance¦101529
\v 18 and saw \add the master\add* telling me, ‘Get out of Yerushalem¦101542 in a hurry because¦101543 they¦101545 won't accept¦101545 what you're teaching them about me.’
\v 19 ‘\nd Master¦101553\nd*,’ I replied, ‘they¦101554 know that previously I was the one imprisoning¦101559 and¦101560 beating¦101561 the people who believed¦101566 in you¦101568,
\v 20 and when Stephen¦101575 was killed after teaching about you¦101578, it was me standing there and cheering on the ones executing him¦101595 as I held their coats for them.’
\v 21 Then¦101596 \add the master\add* told me, ‘Get going¦101601 now because¦101602 I'm sending¦101608 you¦101610 away to the non-Jews¦101605.’ ”

\rem /s1 Paul and the Roman Tribune
\p
\v 22 Until this point in his message¦101618, the crowd had been listening to Paul, but now they started shouting, “Do away with this man¦101630! He doesn't deserve to live in this world!”
\v 23 Then they yelled and threw some of their¦101644 clothes¦101645 down onto the ground and threw dust up into the air.
\rem /s1 Paul Reveals His Roman Citizenship
\v 24 So the commander¦101656 ordered Paul to be brought¦101657 inside into barracks¦101662 and ordered that he be flogged¦101665 and interrogated¦101666 to determine what he'd done that would make the crowd react like that.
\v 25 But as they strapped¦101689 him down and stretched¦101684 him out for the flogging¦101708, Paul¦101697 asked the centurion¦101694 standing there, “It is legal for you to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't even been tried?”
\p
\v 26 When he heard¦101710 that, the centurion¦101713 went to the commander¦101722 and reported¦101724, “How are we going¦101729 to handle this, because¦101732 this man¦101733 is a Roman citizen?”
\p
\v 27 So¦101739 the commander¦101741 went in to where Paul was and asked him¦101744, “Tell me the truth. Are you¦101749 a Roman citizen?”
\p “Yes I am,” said¦101743 Paul.
\p
\v 28 “Yeah, and¦101761 I paid a lot for mine as well,” mocked the commander¦101764.
\p “Actually mine is through birth,” Paul¦101779 responded.
\p
\v 29 At this point, the soldiers who were about to interrogate¦101795 Paul left the room, and even the commander¦101798 was now afraid¦101800 after learning¦101801 that he had had a Roman citizen tied down to be flogged.

\p
\v 30 The next day¦101811, the Roman commander¦101831 still wanted to know¦101815 what was behind the anger of the Jews¦101824, so he had Paul released¦101825 from the cell, but¦101812 brought¦101843 him down to a room where he had ordered the chief¦101835 priests¦101835 and the Jewish council¦101840 to convene. Paul was given a seat
\c 23
\nb
\v 1 and looking directly at the council¦101854 members said¦101857, “Men, brothers¦101859, all my life I have lived¦101864 before \nd God¦101866\nd* as a good¦101863 citizen¦101864 and with a clean conscience¦101862.”
\v 2 But¦101872 Ananias¦101874 the chief¦101873 priest¦101873 commanded¦101876 one of his¦101881 companions to whack Paul on the mouth¦101883.
\v 3 “\nd God¦101897\nd* will strike¦101893 you,” said¦101892 Paul¦101886, “you grand show-off. You've been brought here to judge me as someone who knows the law and yet you violate¦101909 the law by commanding¦101910 that I be hit in the face.”
\p
\v 4 But the others standing there said¦101916, “Are you¦101922 insulting¦101922 God's chief¦101919 priest¦101919?”
\p
\v 5 “Brothers¦101929,” said Paul¦101926, “I didn't realise that he's the chief¦101932 priest¦101932, because¦101934 the scriptures teach us not to speak¦101941 wrongly¦101942 of our leaders.”
\p
\v 6 But then, knowing¦101943 that the council¦101961 consisted of some from the sect of the Sadducees¦101952 and some from the Pharisees' party, Paul¦101946 continued loudly, “Men, brothers¦101963, like my father, I'm a member¦101965 of the Pharisees and I'm being¦101976 tried today concerning¦101970 the hope and the resurrection¦101973 of the dead¦101974!”
\p
\v 7 Well, as soon as he said this, the council was split as the Pharisees and the Sadducees¦101993 started arguing.
\v 8 (Sadducees¦101999 say that the dead don't come back to life, and there's no messengers¦102008 and no spirits¦102010, but¦102012 the Pharisees believe there is.)
\v 9 So¦102017 then there was a big kerfuffle because some of the teachers¦102026 of the law spoke up for the Pharisees saying¦102035, “We don't see anything wrong with this man¦102041. Maybe it was a spirit¦102045 or one \add of God's\add* messengers¦102049 that spoke to him.”
\p
\v 10 But¦102053 the \add Roman\add* commander¦102063 was afraid¦102060 that they might tear Paul apart¦102065 in the big argument, so he called for his soldiers to come¦102075 down to uplift Paul and return him to the barracks¦102087.
\p
\v 11 The following¦102090 night¦102091, the \nd master¦102095\nd* appeared to Paul and told him¦102093, “Be brave because¦102100 just like you testified¦102101 about me here in Yerushalem¦102107, so too you'll tell them about me in Rome¦102113.”

\rem /s1 The Plot to Kill Paul
\p
\v 12 The next day¦102118, some of the Jews¦102128 gathered¦102122 informally and pledged not to eat¦102135 or drink¦102137 until¦102139 they'd killed Paul¦102147.
\v 13 There were more than forty¦102151 of them in this conspiracy¦102157,
\v 14 and they approached¦102161 the chief¦102163 priests¦102163 and elders¦102166 and told them, “We've¦102169 made an oath to taste¦102173 nothing¦102172 until¦102176 we've killed Paul¦102181, otherwise we'll bring a curse¦102169 on ourselves¦102171.
\v 15 So¦102183 you guys assemble the council¦102198 and report¦102193 to the commander¦102195 so that he'll bring¦102202 him down to you all as if you need more information about his actions, and then we'll have an opportunity to kill¦102226 before¦102218 he gets here.
\p
\v 16 But a nephew of Paul had heard¦102232 about this ambush¦102241 and¦102244 went in to the barracks¦102249 to inform Paul.
\v 17 Paul¦102256 then called¦102253 one of the Roman centurions¦102259 and told him to take the young¦102263 man¦102263 to the commander¦102269 because¦102271 he had something¦102274 to tell him.
\v 18 So¦102278 the centurion took him to the commander¦102284, explaining, “The prisoner¦102288 Paul¦102289, called¦102290 me and asked¦102292 me to bring this young¦102295 man¦102295 to you because he has something¦102301 to report to you.”
\p
\v 19 The commander¦102311 took the young man by the hand¦102308 and led him¦102309 into his¦102309 private office and asked, “What do you¦102321 have to tell me?”
\p
\v 20 “The Jews¦102328 have decided¦102329 to ask¦102331 you,”, he said¦102324, “that tomorrow¦102334 you bring¦102337 Paul¦102336 down to the council¦102340 as if they wanted to question him further.
\v 21 But don't¦102356 listen to them because¦102360 over forty¦102366 of their¦102362 men¦102364 will be lying¦102359 in wait for him, and they have sworn not to eat¦102371 or drink¦102373 until¦102375 they've killed him. In fact, they're all set up already, just waiting¦102385 for your consent.”
\p
\v 22 The commander¦102393 told the young¦102396 man¦102396 not to tell anyone¦102399 else about the ambush and dismissed him.

\p
\v 23 Then¦102407 the commander called¦102408 in two of his centurions¦102413 and ordered them to prepare two-hundred soldiers to travel as far as Caesarea¦102421, supported by seventy¦102424 mounted soldiers and two-hundred more with spears¦102426. They were to be ready to leave by 9pm,
\v 24 along with a horse for Paul¦102440 to ride, and were to get him safely¦102441 to Governor Felix¦102443.
\v 25 Then the commander wrote¦102462 a letter¦102465 ready to take:
\p
\v 26 “Greetings to the most excellent¦102478 Governor Felix¦102480 from Claudius Lysias¦102475.
\v 27 I'm writing to you about this man¦102483 who had been captured¦102488 by the Jews¦102491 here and they were about to kill him when I moved in with my soldiers because he is a Roman citizen.
\v 28 I wanted to know¦102517 what they were accusing him of, so I took him down to their¦102531 council¦102530 meeting,
\v 29 but¦102543 I discovered that it was just some detail about their¦102541 \add Jewish\add* law and nothing¦102542 that should result in death¦102545 or imprisonment.
\v 30 Then¦102552 when I learnt that they have a plot to try to ambush and kill him, I sent¦102566 him immediately¦102563 to you, and I'll order his accusers¦102572 to bring their case before¦102578 you.”
\p
\v 31 So¦102583 the soldiers¦102584 carried out their instructions and took Paul¦102591 as far as Antipatris¦102598 during the night¦102595.
\v 32 The next morning the foot soldiers returned¦102610 to the barracks¦102613, leaving the mounted soldiers to take him¦102608 on
\v 33 to Caesarea¦102618, where they¦102625 presented¦102625 Paul¦102628 to the governor¦102624 along with the letter¦102622.
\v 34 After reading the letter the governor asked¦102635 Paul what province¦102639 that he's from and found out that he was from Cilicia¦102645.
\v 35 Then he ordered Paul to be kept under guard¦102670 \add in the prison\add* in Herod's¦102669 palace until he would hear¦102650 from him in the future once his accusers¦102656 got there.

\p
\v 1 Five days¦102676 later, Ananias¦102680 the chief¦102679 priest¦102679 arrived along with some elders¦102683 and¦102685 an attorney¦102686 named Tertullos¦102687, to bring the charges against¦102693 Paul¦102695 before Governor \add Felix\add*.
\v 2 Once he was called¦102696 to speak, Tertullos¦102702 began¦102699 his¦102698 accusation¦102700 of Paul:
\p “We have seen peace¦102705 under your rule and the helpful reforms¦102710 that this nation¦102714 has experienced through your provision¦102719,
\v 3 most excellent¦102725 Felix¦102726, and we¦102724 gratefully welcome¦102724 everything you've done and everywhere you've done it¦102724.
\v 4 But in order¦102730 not to oblige you longer than necessary, in your gentleness¦102745 we request you to listen¦102739 to our brief¦102742 statement.
\v 5 This man¦102749 here has been found¦102746 to be a troublemaker, stirring¦102754 up riots among the Jews¦102759 throughout the inhabited¦102763 world¦102763, and as a ring-leader of the Nazarite sect
\v 6 he even attempted¦102774 to profane¦102775 the temple¦102773 where we¦102778 were able to arrest him.
\v 7 ◘
\v 8 When you examine¦102810 him yourself¦102809 you'll discover all these¦102813 things that we're accusing¦102817 him of.”
\v 9 The Jews¦102824 who had come also affirmed all the accusations.
\s1 Paul's defence against the accusations
\rem /s1 Paul's Defense before Felix
\p
\v 10 So¦102830 the governor¦102837 nodded¦102834 for Paul¦102833 to speak¦102838 and he started,
\p “I happily defend¦102854 myself¦102853 today knowing that you have many years¦102841 of experience ruling \add in this region\add*.
\v 11 You can quickly establish that it was less than twelve¦102866 days¦102864 ago that I arrived in Yerushalem¦102874 to worship there¦102862.
\v 12 They never found¦102881 me in the temple¦102880 arguing with anyone¦102884 or stirring up the crowd¦102890, and nor was I doing that in the Jewish¦102894 meeting¦102894 halls¦102894 or anywhere in the city¦102898
\v 13 and so they can't provide evidence to you¦102904 to support any of their accusations¦102910.
\v 14 However, I must confess¦102912 that I follow ‘The Path’ that they¦102921 call a sect which¦102920 serves the \nd God¦102927\nd* of our ancestors¦102926 and¦102934 believes¦102928 everything in \add Mosheh's\add* law as well as the writings of the prophets¦102938.
\v 15 We put our trust in the same God that they themselves¦102948 follow, and we all anticipate a resurrection¦102951 of those who serve God and those who don't.
\v 16 Because of this, I also strive to maintain a clean conscience¦102966 in everything¦102976, before \nd God¦102971\nd* and¦102972 the people¦102974.
\p
\v 17 After several years¦102978 away, I arrived¦102988 \add in Yerushalem\add* bringing offerings¦102990 to help my¦102987 own people and¦102989 before God.
\v 18 That was when they¦102994 found¦102994 me in the temple¦102999 after going through the purification¦102996 ceremony, and without either a crowd¦103002 or a commotion¦103005 around me.
\v 19 But there were some Jews¦103012 from \add the province of\add* Asia¦103011 \add Minor\add* who are the ones who should be appearing here before¦103016 you¦103017, and¦103019 they should be the ones accusing¦103020 me if they could find anything¦103022 against¦103024 me.
\v 20 Even these¦103030 ones here now should¦103031 explain what their council¦103042 found¦103034 me guilty of,
\v 21 other than my calling out that I was being¦103060 judged¦103060 because I believe in the resurrection¦103057 of the dead¦103058.
\p
\v 22 But Felix¦103071 who was already familiar with followers of ‘The Path’, announced that the trial would be adjourned until Commander Lysias¦103083 arrived when he would investigate¦103087 further.
\v 23 He ordered the centurion¦103095 to keep Paul confined, but under relaxed¦103102 conditions and allowing any of his¦103108 friends to bring him anything he needed.
\s1 Paul speaks to the governor and his wife
\rem /s1 Paul Held in Custody

\p
\v 24 However, several days¦103115 later Felix¦103120 returned there, \add this time\add* with his wife¦103125 Drusilla¦103122 who was Jewish. He sent¦103130 for Paul¦103132 and¦103133 listened to him¦103135 explain about faith¦103142 in the \nd messiah¦103139\nd*.
\v 25 But when the subject turned to righteousness¦103147 and self-control¦103150 and the coming¦103156 judgement, Felix¦103163 became very uncomfortable and told him, “That's enough for now. If I have time in the future, I'll send for you.”
\v 26 However he was also hoping¦103178 that Paul¦103185 would give him money¦103180, so he often sent for him and spoke with him.
\p
\v 27 This went on for two¦103197 years¦103197, until Felix was replaced as governor by Porcius¦103204 Festus¦103205, but¦103198 wanting¦103206 to stay in the good books of the Jews¦103212, Felix left Paul¦103218 confined.

\s1 Tried yet again, Paul appeals to Caesar

\rem /s1 The Trial Before Festus
\p
\v 1 After Festus¦103220 had been in the area for three¦103227 days¦103228, he made the uphill trip from Caesarea¦103233 to Yerushalem¦103231.
\v 2 There the chief¦103241 priests¦103241 and the Jewish leaders¦103244 repeated their case against¦103247 Paul¦103249, and they¦103251 implored¦103251 Festus,
\v 3 asking as a special favour¦103254, that he would order Paul to be sent to Yerushalem¦103263 (because they wanted to ambush¦103264 and kill¦103266 him on the way¦103270).
\v 4 But Festus¦103274 replied that he'd keep Paul¦103278 in Caesarea¦103281 and¦103284 he was heading back there soon,
\v 5 so he told them, “Some of your leaders can go there with me, and if the man¦103305 has done anything¦103300 wrong, they can explain their accusations¦103308 there.”
\p
\v 6 After staying seven or eight¦103319 days¦103314 in Yerushalem, Festus and company travelled back to Caesarea¦103324, and the next day¦103326 he sat¦103328 at the judge's bench and ordered that Paul¦103334 be brought¦103336 in.
\v 7 When he arrived¦103337, the Jews¦103346 who had come¦103345 from Yerushalem¦103344 stood¦103340 facing Paul and¦103348 presented many heavy¦103349 charges¦103350 which¦103357 they¦103359 weren't able to prove.
\v 8 Paul¦103363 defended¦103364 himself, stating that he had not sinned¦103381 against any Jewish law or against the temple¦103376, nor against any Roman law.
\p
\v 9 However, Festus¦103383 wanted to be able to grant¦103392 a favour¦103390 to the Jews¦103388, so in response to Paul¦103395 he asked, “Are you willing¦103397 to be returned to Yerushalem¦103399 so that I can judge¦103405 you about these¦103403 things there¦103401?”
\p
\v 10 “I'm here facing Caesar's representative,” Paul¦103411 replied. “and it's quite appropriate¦103421 for me to be judged¦103422 here. I've done nothing¦103424 wrong¦103426 to these Jews¦103423 as you¦103429 can no doubt see for yourself.
\v 11 If I had done anything wrong¦103437, anything worthy¦103439 of the death sentence, then I'm ready to accept death. On the other¦103448 hand, if none of their accusations¦103453 are true, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar¦103461.”
\p
\v 12 So the Festus¦103465 conferred with his legal counsel¦103470 and answered¦103471, “Well, you've appealed¦103473 to Caesar so you'll go to Caesar!”

\v 14 As they¦103498 \add had planned to\add* stay on for a few days¦103497, Festus¦103502 mentioned about Paul¦103509 to the king¦103504, telling him, “There's¦103513 a prisoner¦103517 here that Felix¦103516 left behind.
\v 15 When I was in Yerushalem¦103523, the chief¦103527 priests¦103527 and¦103528 Jewish elders¦103530 reported¦103524 to me, wanting a conviction¦103536 of this man.
\v 16 I told them that it's not the Roman way to convict someone until they've been able to face¦103558 their accusers and¦103564 make their defence¦103565 against the accusations.
\v 17 So¦103571 as soon as they arrived here, on the very next day¦103579 I sat¦103581 on the judge's bench and ordered the man¦103588 to be brought¦103586 in
\v 18 that they were accusing¦103593, but they didn't raise even one of the charges¦103595 that I expected.
\v 19 Instead they¦103612 raised some issues about their¦103609 own beliefs and¦103616 about some dead person called \nd Yeshua¦103619\nd* that Paul¦103624 reckoned was still living¦103625.
\v 20 I was puzzled about this debate¦103634 and asked him if he wanted to be judged¦103644 about these things in Yerushalem¦103642.
\v 21 But Paul¦103649 appealed¦103650 to be kept safe from them until he could face the emperor, so I ordered him to be kept \add in prison\add* until I can send him to Rome.
\p
\v 22 “I'd quite like to hear him myself¦103677,” Agrippa¦103669 said.
\rem /s1 Paul Before Agrippa
\rem /s1 Paul Brought before Agrippa
\rem /s1 Paul Speaks to Agrippa
\p “Well, tomorrow,” replied Festus¦103673, “you'll be able to hear from him.”
\p
\v 23 So¦103688 the next day¦103687, \add King\add* Agrippa¦103692 and Bernice¦103695 formally arrived with all their attendants and entered the auditorium¦103704 to greet the commanders¦103708 and the prominent¦103713 men¦103710 of the city¦103716, and then Festus¦103720 ordered for Paul¦103723 to be brought¦103721 in.
\v 24 Festus¦103727 started, “King Agrippa¦103728 and everyone present¦103733, observe¦103736 the prisoner who a multitude¦103743 of Jews¦103745 pleaded¦103746 with me about both in Yerushalem¦103751 and here, that he doesn't deserve to still be alive.
\v 25 But I haven't discovered anything that he's done that's worthy¦103767 of a death¦103769 sentence, and since he himself¦103773 appealed¦103778 to the emperor, I judged¦103781 that that's where he should be sent.
\v 26 The problem is that I don't¦103792 have any charge to write to my master¦103791 and so I've brought¦103796 the prisoner out in front of you so that after you examine¦103808 him, I might have something¦103812 I can write,
\v 27 because¦103816 it¦103818 doesn't seem logical to me to transport a prisoner¦103820 \add to Rome\add* if there's no charges¦103826 specified against¦103824 him¦103825.
\c 26
\s1 Paul's defence before Festus and Agrippa
\rem /s1 Paul Defends Himself before Agrippa
\p
\v 1 So then Agrippa¦103828 told Paul¦103832, “Okay, you¦103835 can give your side now then.”
\m So Paul gestured with his hand¦103846 and began:
\p
\v 2 “Concerning¦103848 all the charges which¦103850 have been brought against me by the Jews¦103853, King Agrippa¦103855, I consider¦103856 myself¦103857 fortunate
\v 3 because you're an expert on Jewish customs¦103880 and issues, so I ask you to listen¦103889 to me patiently¦103888.
\p
\v 4 “All the Jews¦103913 know about my early life, from my upbringing in my own country and¦103908 then in Yerushalem¦103909.
\v 5 They also know, and could even testify¦103919 to you if they¦103918 would admit it, that I followed our¦103926 religious¦103927 laws very closely as a member¦103929 of the Pharisees party¦103929.
\v 6 Yet now I stand judged¦103946 for believing in the same hope as our ancestors¦103938—that hope promised¦103940 by our \nd God¦103944\nd*
\v 7 who we twelve¦103950 tribes¦103950 diligently serve day¦103956 and¦103955 night¦103954 in order to obtain—the hope, oh king¦103971, for which I'm being¦103965 indicted¦103965.
\v 8 So why do you¦103976 all find it¦103974 unbelievable¦103973 that \nd God¦103979\nd* can raise the dead¦103980?
\p
\v 9 “I too \add originally\add* thought it¦103994 necessary¦103994 to do many things to oppose the cause of this \nd Yeshua¦103991\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦103993\nd*.
\v 10 So in Yerushalem¦104004 I worked to have many of these innocent believers locked¦104013 up in prison¦104012 with the authority¦104018 of the chief¦104017 priests¦104017, or if they were to be killed¦104020, I would add my vote against¦104023 them.
\v 11 And in all the Jewish¦104030 meeting¦104030 halls¦104030, \add when I found believers\add* I punished¦104032 them and forced them to curse \add God\add* and treated them with extreme anger, even travelling to further away towns.

\p
\v 12 So it was one time travelling to Damascus¦104053 carrying permission¦104057 letters from the chief¦104061 priests¦104061
\v 13 that in the middle¦104063 of the day¦104062, oh king¦104068, I saw¦104067 a bright light¦104078 from the sky—even brighter than the sun¦104075—and it shone¦104076 on me and my companions.
\v 14 All of us fell down to the ground¦104091 and I heard¦104092 a voice¦104093 speaking to me in Hebrew¦104101 saying¦104094, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting¦104107 me? Life will be difficult for you if resist me.”
\v 15 “Who are you, master?” I asked.
\p And the master responded¦104115, “I am \nd Yeshua¦104126\nd*, the one you're¦104118 persecuting¦104129.
\v 16 Now get up, because¦104140 I let you see me in order to appoint¦104143 you as my servant and my witness¦104148—to tell the people what you've seen and what you will be shown.
\v 17 I will rescue¦104157 you from your own people¦104161 and from the non-Jews¦104165 that I'm sending¦104171 you out to,
\v 18 to open their minds and for them to turn¦104180 back from darkness¦104182 to light¦104184 and from Satan's¦104190 power¦104188 to \nd God¦104193\nd*, so that they can be forgiven¦104197 for their sins¦104198 and receive¦104195 an inheritance among¦104201 the ones who've been made guiltless by their faith¦104204 in me.”
\s1 Paul tells about his ministry

\rem /s1 Paul Tells of His Work
\p
\v 19 “So then, King Agrippa¦104210, I couldn't disobey that vision¦104216
\v 20 so I preached first¦104221 to those in Damascus¦104220 and then in Yerushalem¦104225 and all of Yudea¦104233, and then in the towns of the non-Jews¦104236. I preached about turning from their sins and turning back to \nd God¦104245\nd*, and then actually living like people who had repented¦104240.
\v 21 It was because of these¦104252 things that the Jews¦104255 grabbed me in the temple¦104262 and tried to do me in.
\v 22 So¦104266 it is that with God's help¦104265 until¦104273 this very day¦104275 I have stood¦104277 testifying¦104278 to commoners and leaders, teaching nothing¦104284 other than what Mosheh and the prophets¦104290 had already written that would happen—
\v 23 that the \nd messiah¦104299\nd* would \add come and\add* suffer¦104297 and as the first¦104301 of the dead¦104304 to come back to life, he is going¦104306 to be proclaiming¦104308 light¦104305 to both Jews and non-Jews¦104314.”
\rem /s1 Paul Appeals to Agrippa to Believe
\p
\v 24 Then¦104316 speaking about Paul's defence¦104318, Governor Festus¦104320 said, “Paul, you're stark, raving¦104326 mad! All your education has turned you into an idiot.”
\p
\v 25 But Paul¦104338 said, “I haven't gone mad, most excellent¦104342 Festus¦104343, but¦104344 I'm speaking¦104349 the truth¦104345 in all seriousness.
\v 26 The king knows what I'm talking¦104360 about and that's why I'm speaking boldly¦104359, because¦104351 none of these things were done in a corner¦104373 and I'm sure that none of it has escaped¦104361 his notice¦104361.
\v 27 King Agrippa¦104379, do you believe what the prophets¦104381 \add wrote\add*? Yes, I'm sure you do.
\p
\v 28 But¦104386 Agrippa¦104387 answered Paul¦104390, “Do you think you can talk me into becoming a follower¦104397 of the messiah¦104397 in just that short time¦104393?”
\p
\v 29 “I hope to \nd God¦104408\nd*”, said Paul¦104402, “whether it takes a short time or a long time, that both you and the others listening today¦104425 will become¦104426 just like me except¦104433 for these¦104436 chains.”
\p
\v 30 Then the king¦104444 and the governor¦104447 both stood, along with Bernice¦104450 and the others sitting¦104453 with them
\v 31 and as they left they were saying¦104460 to each other, “That man¦104472 hasn't done anything deserving of death¦104464 or imprisonment.”
\p
\v 32 “Yes, he could have been set free,” replied Agrippa¦104474, “if he hadn't appealed¦104486 to Caesar¦104487.”

\s1 Paul is escorted off overseas
\rem /s1 Paul Sails for Rome
\rem /s1 Paul's journey to Rome
\p
\v 1 So¦104489 when it¦104490 was considered the right season to sail to Italy¦104496, Paul¦104501 and¦104502 some other¦104504 prisoners¦104505 were put under the guard of a centurion¦104506 named Julius (from the Augustan¦104511 Regiment).
\v 2 We all boarded¦104512 on a ship¦104514 from Adramyttium¦104515 that was about to sail to various places¦104525 along¦104522 the coast of Asia¦104524 \add Minor\add*. Aristarchus¦104530, a Macedonian man from Thessalonica¦104533, was with us as we¦104526 departed.
\p
\v 3 The next day¦104536 we¦104537 docked at Tsidon where Julius very kindly allowed Paul¦104546 to visit some of his friends¦104551 so they could provide for his needs.
\v 4 When we¦104558 left again, the ship stayed between Cyprus¦104560 and the mainland because¦104561 of the unfavourable winds¦104564,
\v 5 then after sailing past Cilicia¦104573 and¦104574 Pamfylia¦104575, we¦104577 docked at Myra¦104582 in \add the province\add* of Lycia¦104584.
\v 6 There the centurion¦104589 found¦104587 a ship¦104591 from Alexandria¦104592 that was sailing¦104593 to Italy¦104596, so he boarded us on that.
\p
\v 7 After many days¦104605 of slow and difficult¦104608 sailing¦104606, we came alongside Cnidus¦104612 but the wind¦104617 wasn't helpful to us, so we sailed¦104618 across to Crete¦104620 and along the cape of Salmone.
\v 8 We sailed along¦104625 it¦104626 with difficulty¦104623 until we¦104627 came¦104627 to a place¦104629 called¦104631 ‘Fair Havens’ which¦104634 was near the city¦104637 of Lasea.
\p
\v 9 A lot of time¦104643 had now elapsed¦104644 and¦104645 the voyage¦104650 was starting to become dangerous¦104648 because¦104651 we were already heading into winter. Paul¦104660 advised¦104658 those in charge,
\v 10 telling them, “Men, I perceive¦104664 that we're going to encounter a lot of damage¦104667 on this voyage¦104688, with loss not only of the cargo¦104676 and the ship¦104679, but also our¦104684 lives¦104683.”
\v 11 But the centurion¦104691 was persuaded¦104700 by the ship¦104697 owner¦104697 and¦104695 the captain¦104694, rather¦104699 than by what Paul¦104705 had said.
\v 12 They realised that this harbour wasn't suitable to winter in, so the majority suggested leaving there¦104720 with the expectation of being¦104711 able to get to Crete¦104732 to the winter in the harbour at Phoenix¦104728 (which was open to both the southwest¦104735 and¦104736 the northwest¦104738).
\s1 The severe storm at sea
\rem /s1 The Storm
\rem /s1 The Storm at Sea
\p
\v 13 When a south¦104742 wind¦104742 started blowing gently¦104739, they thought they could make it, so they pulled in the anchor and sailed along¦104749 close to Crete¦104751.
\v 14 However¦104764, a short while later the wind¦104760 turned to a violent north-easter which¦104762 forced us out to sea.
\v 15 The ship¦104769 was driven by the wind¦104775 and unable to tack to face into it, so the sailors gave¦104776 up and just let it be driven.
\v 16 As we passed a small island¦104778 called¦104782 Clauda¦104784, we got a brief break and were able to resecure the lifeboat¦104792
\v 17 and then bring it up on board. Then¦104802 ropes were used to wrap around the ship in case it were to run aground¦104807 into the shallows¦104805 at Syrtis¦104806 and the gear was lowered¦104808,\f + \fr 27:17 \ft It's not certain what was meant here—it might have meant lowering the sails further to catch less wind or even lowering the mast, or else letting out the sea anchor to help keep the back of the ship facing the wind.\f* allowing the wind to drive¦104812 the ship along¦104812.
\v 18 We were violently¦104813 tossed¦104816 around by the storm¦104816, and the next day¦104818 the crew started \add lightening the ship by\add* tipping \add some of the cargo\add* overboard.
\v 19 By the third¦104824 day¦104824, the sailors themselves \add in desperation\add* were even throwing some of the ship's gear overboard.
\v 20 We didn't see either the sun¦104834 or the stars¦104836 for several more days¦104841—it wasn't a minor storm¦104842 by any means—and¦104843 by then any remaining hope that we had \add of staying alive\add* disappeared
\v 21 and no one had eaten or drunk much at all.
\p Then¦104856 Paul¦104863 stood¦104861 up in the middle of them and said¦104867, “Well, you should have listened to me after all and not left Crete¦104878, so now we have this damage¦104882 and loss.
\v 22 Nevertheless I think we can all cheer¦104892 up because¦104894 not a single life¦104895 will be lost—only the ship¦104903—
\v 23 because¦104905 last night¦104910 one of the messengers¦104921 of the \nd God¦104914\nd* that I serve came and stood¦104904 beside me
\v 24 and told me not to be afraid because I would indeed get to stand¦104929 before Caesar¦104926 and that \nd God¦104935\nd* has granted¦104932 your lives to me as well.
\v 25 So¦104941 cheer¦104942 up, fellows, because¦104945 I am certain that \nd God¦104947\nd* will carry out what was told to me
\v 26 even though we'll run¦104964 aground¦104964 onto an island¦104958 first.”
\rem /s1 The Shipwreck
\p
\v 27 So it happened that in the middle¦104977 of our fourteenth¦104967 night of being¦104971 blown across the Adriatic¦104975 Sea, the sailors¦104982 suspected¦104980 that we were nearing land.
\v 28 They dropped a weighted line and measured the ocean depth at around 40 metres and then a bit later it was down to 30 metres.
\v 29 Worrying that the ship might run¦105018 aground¦105018 on rough¦105015 \add rocks\add*, they threw out four¦105024 anchors¦105023 from the stern¦105021 as they hoped that daylight would come quickly.
\v 30 Then¦105030 the sailors¦105031 lowered¦105039 the lifeboat¦105041 as if planning to pull out some anchors¦105051 from the bow, but really planning to desert the ship¦105037.
\v 31 However Paul¦105056 told the centurion¦105058 and¦105059 the soldiers¦105061 that if the sailors didn't remain¦105065 with the ship¦105068, everybody couldn't be sure to be saved¦105071,
\v 32 so the soldiers¦105077 cut the ropes¦105080 attaching the lifeboat¦105082 and¦105083 allowed¦105084 it to run¦105086 aground¦105086.
\p
\v 33 As they waited for the daylight, Paul¦105099 encouraged them all to eat something, saying¦105103, “Today¦105105 is our fourteenth¦105104 day and you've had nothing¦105110 to eat. As we're waiting¦105107,
\v 34 I urge you to eat something. This will help you to have strength because none of you are going to drown.”
\v 35 Having said¦105141 that, he gave¦105147 thanks¦105147 to \nd God¦105150\nd* in front of everyone, and breaking some bread¦105146, started eating¦105156 it.
\v 36 They all cheered¦105157 up and also started eating.
\v 37 There were two¦105181 hundred¦105181 and seventy-six¦105182 of them on the ship¦105179,
\v 38 and when they'd all eaten what they wanted, they lightened¦105189 the ship¦105191 more by throwing¦105192 their wheat¦105194 into the sea¦105197.
\s1 The ship runs aground
\rem /s1 The Shipwreck
\p
\v 39 Once it became¦105201 light, they saw that they were close to shore¦105212 in a bay but didn't recognise¦105206 the place. After some discussion, they decided to try to save the ship¦105225
\v 40 so they cut away the anchors¦105228 that were holding them in the sea¦105234 and untied the rudder¦105240 \add handles\add*. Then¦105226 raising the foresail¦105244, they let the wind¦105245 blow them into the shore¦105250.
\v 41 But they hit a bank with ocean on both sides of it and the ship ran aground¦105256. The bow of the ship was completely stuck¦105265 but¦105252 the stern¦105271 was being¦105272 broken up by the force¦105276 of the ocean.
\p
\v 42 At this point the soldiers¦105281 decided that they¦105287 should kill¦105287 the prisoners¦105286 in case any of them decided to swim away and escape¦105291,
\v 43 but¦105294 the centurion¦105295 wanted to keep Paul¦105300 safe so he vetoed that plan. He commanded¦105307 those who could swim to jump off and swim in to shore,
\v 44 and for the others¦105330 to grab \add floating\add* planks¦105328 or something off the ship¦105336 \add that would float\add*, and so everyone¦105326 got safely¦105341 onto the beach.

\rem /s1 Paul on the Island of Malta
\p
\v 1 Once everyone was safe, we¦105349 discovered that the island¦105354 is called¦105355 Malta.
\v 2 And the people there showed incredible kindness¦105365 to us as they¦105372 welcomed us and lit a fire¦105370, as it started raining again and was very cold¦105383.
\v 3 However when Paul¦105387 was helping to pick up sticks¦105388 and putting them on the fire¦105398, a viper¦105399 was driven out by the heat and clamped¦105406 its jaws down on his¦105410 hand¦105409.
\v 4 When the islanders saw¦105413 the snake hanging from his hand¦105422 they decided that he must be a murderer¦105429 who had survived the shipwreck but now fate had finally decided his time was up.
\v 5 However, Paul just shook the snake off into the fire¦105453 and wasn't harmed.
\v 6 The locals were waiting¦105473 for his arm to swell¦105464 up or for him to fall down dead¦105468, but¦105458 after a while when nothing¦105476 happened they changed¦105481 their¦105481 minds¦105481 and decided that instead, he must be a god¦105489.
\p
\v 7 The area that we had beached in belonged to the leader¦105500 of the island¦105502 named Publius¦105504. He welcomed us and looked after us for three¦105508 days¦105509,
\v 8 but while we were there, his father¦105516 got sick with dysentery¦105521 and fever¦105519. Paul¦105528 went in and placing his hands¦105535 on him, prayed¦105531 for him and healed¦105537 him.
\v 9 As a result of that, anyone on the whole island¦105551 who was sick came and was cured
\v 10 and so the people brought us many gifts and when we left, they supplied us with provisions.

\v 14 where¦105614 we found¦105615 some believers¦105616 and they encouraged us to stay for seven¦105624 days¦105623. Then¦105625 we \add finally\add* got to Rome¦105630.
\v 15 The believers¦105635 in Rome had heard¦105636 about us, so they came¦105640 to meet us at the Appius¦105649 Market¦105650 and the Three¦105652 Taverns¦105653. Paul¦105657 was encouraged to see them and thanked¦105658 \nd God¦105660\nd*.

\v 16 When we¦105665 got into Rome¦105670 proper, Paul¦105681 was allowed to live by himself¦105686, with just a soldier¦105691 guarding¦105689 him¦105690.

\p
\v 17 After three¦105696 days¦105695, he called together the leaders¦105705 of the Jews¦105704 \add in Rome\add*, and when they'd all gathered he spoke to them, “Men, brothers¦105715, I have done nothing¦105717 against my people¦105721 or against our ancestral¦105726 customs¦105724. I was taken prisoner¦105727 in Yerushalem¦105729 and handed over to the Romans
\v 18 who, after examining¦105737 me, wanted to release me because¦105743 I had done nothing worthy of execution.
\v 19 But in defending myself against the Jews there, I felt compelled¦105755 to appeal¦105756 to Caesar¦105757, although I myself had no complaint against the Jews.
\v 20 So¦105770 that was why I called for you and wanted to address¦105778 you, because¦105781 I am in chains¦105788 for the sake of Israel's hope—\add the messiah\add*.”
\p
\v 21 “We haven't received¦105804 any correspondence here about you,” they answered. “Nor have any of our brothers¦105812 \add from Yerushalem\add* arrived¦105809 here to report¦105813 any crimes of yours.
\v 22 But we would very much like to hear¦105825 from you about your thinking¦105827, because we've certainly heard about this new sect because everyone¦105839 is speaking out against¦105840 it.”

\p
\v 23 Then¦105842 they set a day¦105844 when they could visit him where he was staying and so that from morning¦105880 to evening¦105882 he could explain¦105855 about God's kingdom¦105861 and show them how Mosheh's law and the prophets' writings spoke about \nd Yeshua¦105870\nd*.
\v 24 Afterwards some were persuaded¦105887 while others¦105891 didn't find it believable.
\v 25 They argued back and forth, and as they¦105899 were about to leave, Paul¦105902 shared this final¦105904 message¦105903, “The holy \nd spirit¦105908\nd* spoke¦105911 rightly through Isayah¦105914 the prophet¦105916 to your¦105920 ancestors¦105919, saying:
\q1
\v 26 Go to these people¦105931 and tell them,
\q1 When you listen you will hear¦105936 but not understand¦105942,
\q1 and when you look you will see but not perceive¦105950 it.
\q1
\v 27 Because¦105953 these people's¦105957 minds have become¦105952 dull
\q2 and they can barely hear with their ears
\q2 and they shut their eyes,
\q1 just in case their eyes might actually see,
\q2 and their ears might actually hear,
\q2 and they might understand¦105981 with their minds,
\q1 and turn back to me
\q2 and then I would heal them.
\p
\v 28 So¦105990 now let it¦105991 be known¦105989 to you¦105992 all that the \add message of\add* salvation¦106000 from \nd God¦106002\nd* has been sent¦105997 out to non-Jews¦105996 and¦106004 they¦106003 will listen.”

\v 30 Paul remained¦106018 in his own rental¦106028 accommodation in Rome for two¦106024 whole¦106025 years¦106024 and¦106029 welcomed¦106030 everyone who went to see him¦106035,
\v 31 telling them about God's kingdom¦106038 and¦106041 boldly teaching¦106042 about the \nd master¦106046 Yeshua¦106047\nd* without any hindrance.
