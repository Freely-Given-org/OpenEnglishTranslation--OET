\is1 Introduction
\is2 The author
\ip Paul
\is2 The recipient
\ip Titos, often spelt (wrongly) as ‘Titus’ in English translations, wasn't a Jew and didn't originally believe in God. However, in later times he became a believer and from there, he became a helper in Paul's work. This letter was sent by Paul there to Titos in Crete where he had been left to look after a group of believers. (Crete is an island that was a part of Greece.)
\is2 This letter
\ip There are three main things contained in this letter: Firstly Titos is reminded about what is appropriate behaviour for teachers of believers. It was important that he understand this because those from Crete had many undesirable customs and there were many teachers of false doctrines that would confuse believers.
\ip Secondly Titos was advised Titos how to teach the various groups of believers there, including young men and slaves, along with older men and women. (Then those older women were to teach the younger women.)
\ip Finally Paul advised Titos about how believers should live, including avoiding attacking others, arguing, and splitting the believers into opposing groups. Paul reminded Titos again to follow the teachings of Yeshua the messiah and obey what he commanded us.
\ip Paul wanted it to be known that it's very important for believers to behave well (1:6; 2:7,14; 3:1,8-9,14) even though doing good things can't earn their salvation (3:5).

\rem /s1 Salutation; Greetings from Paul
\p
\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul, a slave¦139882 of God and a missionary of \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦139888\nd* and follower of the faith¦139890 of the ones that¦139896 God has chosen.
\p I share the knowledge¦139894 of the truth¦139895 which¦139896 leads to godliness
\v 2 and the expectation of living forever which¦139903 God promised¦139904 before¦139908 time began. And God can't lie
\v 3 but¦139912 revealed¦139911 his message¦139916 in his own time, and I've been entrusted¦139921 to proclaim¦139919 this by the command¦139924 of \nd God¦139928\nd* our¦139927 saviour¦139926.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4: \xt 2Cor 8:23; Gal 2:3; 2Tim 4:10.\x*To Titos¦139929, my true son due to our common¦139933 faith¦139934. May \nd God¦139940\nd* the father¦139941 and our saviour¦139948 \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦139944\nd* give you grace¦139935 and peace¦139938.

\v 5 The reason¦139951 that I asked you to stay behind¦139952 in Crete¦139957 was so that you would find what needed to be reorganised and so that you would appoint¦139965 elders¦139968 in every city¦139967 just as I had directed¦139972 you.
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6-9: \xt 1Tim 3:2-7.\x*Each elder must have a clean record, be the husband¦139979 of one wife¦139978, and have believing¦139982 children¦139980 who are not wild or disobedient.
\v 7 Any overseer¦139992 \add in the assembly\add* as a manager¦139997 working for \nd God¦139996\nd* must have a clean record, not be self-centred, not be quick to get angry, not addicted to wine, not a bully¦140005, and not greedy¦140007,
\v 8 but¦140008 rather hospitable¦140009, someone who loves what is good¦140010, sensible¦140011, honest, loves God, and self-controlled.
\v 9 He must hold faithfully¦140020 to the message that was taught¦140019, so that he will be effective in encouraging others with sound¦140034 teaching and to be rebuking¦140038 those who speak¦140037 against¦140037 the message.
\s1 Handling those who go off the track
\p
\v 10 There's plenty of people who don't want to be told what to do, empty talkers¦140044 and¦140045 outright deceivers¦140046, especially those that push the letter of the law.
\v 11 These people need to be silenced¦140055 because they mess up whole¦140057 families when they teach¦140060 them things that they shouldn't¦140062—all for the sake of shameful¦140065 game.
\v 12 One of their¦140071 own prophets¦140075 said¦140068 that the people from Crete¦140076 are liars¦140078, evil¦140079 beasts¦140080, and lazy gluttons,
\v 13 and that's right. For those reasons, you need to sternly tell them they're wrong, so that they can become sound¦140095 in their faith¦140098,
\v 14 and¦140103 not pay attention to Jewish myths¦140102 or human¦140105 rules which turn people away from the truth¦140108.
\v 15 For someone who's pure in their thinking, everything is pure to them, but for unbelievers¦140118 and those who've strayed from the truth, nothing¦140119 is pure because their minds and consciences¦140129 have already been damaged—
\v 16 they say that they know \nd God¦140130\nd*, but their¦140133 actions show that they don't, and so they're detestable¦140137. They can no longer accept teaching so they're unsuitable for any good¦140145 work.

\s1 Proper behaviour for believers
\rem /s1 Teach Sound Doctrine; Promote Right Teaching; What Must Be Taught to Various Groups
\p
\v 1 But you¦140147, \add Titos,\add* only \add ≈teach¦140155 what's consistent with sound¦140154 doctrine\add*.
\v 2 Older men¦140156 should be sober¦140157, dignified¦140159, sensible¦140160, and sound¦140161 in their faith¦140163, their love¦140165, and their endurance¦140167.
\v 3 Likewise older¦140168 women¦140168 should honour god by their behaviour¦140171, not making false accusations, not addicted to a lot of wine. They should teach¦140181 what is good¦140181
\v 4 so that they¦140184 can train the younger women¦140186 to love their husbands¦140187 and children¦140189,
\v 5 and to be sensible¦140190 and pure, homemakers¦140192 that do good¦140193 for others, living under the authority of their¦140196 husbands¦140198 so that others don't¦140200 speak evil of God's message¦140202 because of them.
\p
\v 6 Also encourage younger¦140210 men¦140210 to be sensible¦140213.
\v 7 Be a good¦140220 example¦140219 in everything you do and in your teaching¦140224. Don't be led astray, maintain your dignity¦140229,
\v 8 watch every word that comes out of your lips, stay above reproach—all this so that those who oppose us can be reached because there's nothing¦140239 bad¦140247 they can say about us.
\p
\v 9 Slaves¦140248 need to conform to their master's commands, aiming to please¦140255. They shouldn't¦140257 speak¦140258 against¦140258 their masters¦140250
\v 10 or be pilfering from them, rather they¦140276 should display¦140265 their good¦140266 faith¦140264 so that¦140270 their actions add to the teachings¦140269 of \nd God¦140275\nd* our¦140274 saviour¦140272.
\p
\v 11 This is because¦140280 God's grace¦140282 which offers salvation¦140286 to all people¦140289 has appeared¦140279
\v 12 and teaches us that when we distance ourselves from ungodliness¦140297 and worldly¦140300 lusts¦140301, we can live¦140307 sensibly¦140302 and justly¦140304 and devoutly¦140306 in the present¦140310 age.
\v 13 Then we can look forward to the blessing¦140314 of the \add ≈majestic appearance¦140317\add* of our¦140325 great¦140321 \nd God¦140322\nd* and saviour¦140324, \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦140328\nd*
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14: a \xt Psa 130:8; \xo b \xt Exo 19:5; Deu 4:20; 7:6; 14:2; 1Pe 2:9.\x*who gave¦140330 himself for us in order¦140335 to redeem¦140336 us from all lawlessness¦140340 and to purify¦140342 us into his chosen¦140345 people¦140344, eager to do good¦140347 things.
\p
\v 15 Teach these¦140349 things as you encourage some and scold others, but don't let anyone¦140359 disrespect¦140361 you.

\s1 Expected behaviour
\rem /s1 Maintain Good Deeds; Christian Conduct; Doing What is Good; Do What Is Good
\p
\v 1 Remind people to conform to their rulers¦140365 and authorities¦140367, being¦140368 obedient and ready¦140376 to do anything that's good¦140374.
\v 2 Don't slander¦140379 others, be peaceable¦140380. Don't be strong-willed, but rather show gentleness¦140382 to all people¦140391.
\v 3 We were also foolish¦140397 and stubborn at one time, straying¦140399 from the good and giving in to various¦140405 lusts¦140402 and pleasures, being¦140399 mean and envious, even full of hate and hating¦140412 one another¦140413.
\v 4 But when \nd God¦140425\nd* our¦140424 saviour¦140423 revealed his kindness¦140417 and¦140418 love¦140420 for humankind,
\v 5 he saved¦140443 us, not because of the ‘good deeds’ that¦140429 we did, but out of his mercy¦140441. He regenerated¦140448 us through¦140445 washing¦140447 and renewed¦140450 us by \add his\add* holy \nd spirit¦140451\nd*
\v 6 which he lavishly poured¦140454 on us through¦140458 \nd Yeshua¦140459\nd* the \nd messiah¦140460\nd*
\v 7 so that we might become¦140472 heirs¦140470 with the expectation of living forever, having¦140465 been declared that we have no outstanding legal charges thanks to his grace¦140469.
\v 8 That statement can be trusted. I want you to confirm¦140485 those things so that those who have believed¦140492 in \nd God¦140494\nd* will be leading¦140490 in wanting to do good things. These¦140495 things are good and benefit¦140500 everyone¦140502.
\rem /s1 Paul's Final Remarks and Greetings; Final instructions
\p
\v 9 But avoid¦140514 foolish¦140503 debates¦140505, arguments about ancestry, other strife¦140509, and quarrels¦140512 about \add God's\add* commands because they¦140515 all achieve nothing and waste time.
\v 10 Refuse to listen to a divisive person¦140521 after¦140522 you've given them two warnings
\v 11 knowing¦140528 that such people condemn themselves by their corruption and¦140533 sinful attitude.
