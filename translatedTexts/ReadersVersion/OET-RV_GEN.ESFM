\is1 Introduction
\ip The meaning of the English name \bk Genesis\bk* is ‘source’ or ‘beginning’. Hebrew readers call this document ‘Bereshit’ which is the first word in the Hebrew and means ‘In the beginning’. Some European and other translations call it ‘The first book of Mosheh/Moses’.
\ip This document describes the creation of space and of our planet and its contents, the origin of people, and the beginning of sin and suffering here in the world. This account also describes how God chose one particular people group and how he brought them to the land that he had promised them.
\ip This document has two main parts:
\ip 1. The making of world and the account of the first two people, and then the first ten generations of their descendants. We read about the foundations of human culture, beginning with Adam and Eve and their banishment from the garden, about Kayin killing his brother Abil, about Noah and the worldwide flood, and about the construction of the tower at Babel.
\ip 2. The lives of the ancestors of the Jewish people: Abraham the first ancestor became famous due to his faith and trust, and his obedience of God's commands. Following that is the account about his son Yitshak (Isaac), and his grandson Yacob (Jacob, also named ‘Yisra'el’ or ‘Israel’), and then Yacob's twelve sons who became the founders of the twelve tribes of Yisra'el. That account also includes the part about Yacob's son Yosef and what happened him when he was sold into Egypt (Heb. Mitsrayim) by his brothers as a slave.
\ip We also read the accounts here about the various people groups that proliferated across the continent and formed into nations.
\ip There in final parts of this account, we're told about God's eternal promise of God to the people group that he chose. God doesn't forget his promises, but he also judges and punishes those who disobey him.

\s1 The six days of creation
\rem /s1 Six Days of Creation and the Sabbath; The Account of Creation; The Beginning; The Story of Creation; The creation of the universe
\p
\v 1 In the beginning¦1, God\f + \fr 1:1 \ft As per common practice, we use ‘God’ through the Hebrew scriptures for the word ‘elohim’. Note that ‘elohim’ is a Hebrew language plural, and is translated more literally as ‘gods’ in a few places. However the connected Hebrew verb translated ‘created’ here is clearly a singular form, so the singular noun ‘God’ fits better here and everywhere where ‘elohim’ is used with other verbs marked as being singular. The mysterious plurality of God is confirmed in v26 where ‘our’ is used to refer to him/them.\f* created the heavens¦5 and the earth¦7.
\v 2 The earth¦9 was formless¦11 and empty and darkness¦13 covered the surface of the depth \add waters\add* and God's spirit¦18 was hovering¦20 over the surface of the waters.
\v 3 Then¦26 God¦27 said, “Let there be light,” and light came into existence,\x + \xo 1:3: \xt 2Cor 4:6.\x*
\v 4 and God¦35 observed that the light was good. Then¦36 he separated¦42 the light from the darkness¦47.
\v 5 God¦50 named the light¦52 \em daytime\em*, and the darkness¦54 he named \em nighttime¦56\em*. Then¦49 evening¦59 came, and \add later\add* morning¦62 came, \add and that was the end of the\add* first day.
\p
\v 6 Then God¦68 said, “Let there be a large space in the middle¦71 of the waters, and let it separate¦74 the two lots of waters.”\x + \xo 1:6-8: \xt 2Pe 3:5.\x*
\v 7 So¦79 God¦80 made the large space and separated¦84 between the waters that were underneath from the waters that were above it. Everything¦81 happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 8 and he named the space \em sky\em*. Then¦99 evening¦105 came, and \add later\add* morning¦108 came, \add and that was the end of\add* the second¦110 day¦109.
\p
\v 9 Then God¦114 said¦113, “Let the waters¦116 under¦117 the sky be gathered¦115 to one place¦121, and let the dry ground¦124 appear¦123.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 10 and he named the ground¦132 that appeared \em land\em*, and he named the gathered waters¦135 \add seas\add*, and he saw¦138 that \add what he had done\add* was good¦142.
\v 11 Then¦144 God¦145 said, “Let the land sprout¦146 vegetation¦148: every plant¦149 yielding seed, every fruit tree bearing its own fruit that has its seed inside it, on the earth.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 12 so the land started producing vegetation¦170, every plant¦171 producing its own seed, and every tree¦175 bearing fruit¦178 that has its seed inside it. And¦188 God¦187 saw¦186 that \add what he had done\add* was good¦190.
\v 13 Then¦192 evening¦194 came, and \add later\add* morning¦197 came, \add and that was the end of\add* the third¦199 day¦198.
\p
\v 14 Then God¦203 said¦202, “Let there be lights in the sky to separate¦208 daytime from nighttime¦212, so they'll be signs¦214, and for \add indicating\add* seasons¦215, and for \add tracking\add* days¦216 and years¦217.
\v 15 They must function as lights¦220 in the sky that shine \add light¦223\add* on the earth¦226.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 16 so God¦232 made the two¦235 large lights¦236, the larger, brighter light to rule the day¦243, and the smaller¦247 light to rule the night¦249, and he \add also\add* made the stars¦251.
\v 17 He¦254 put those lights in the sky to shine \add light¦258\add* on the earth¦261,
\v 18 and to oversee the daytime and the nighttime¦265, and to distinguish between the light¦268 and the darkness¦270. And¦273 God¦272 saw¦271 that \add what he had done\add* was good¦275.
\v 19 Then¦277 evening¦279 came, and \add later\add* morning¦282 came, \add and that was the end of\add* the fourth¦284 day¦283.
\p
\v 20 Then God¦288 said¦287, “Let the waters¦290 be full of with swarms¦289 of living¦293 creatures¦292, and let birds fly in the sky above¦296 the earth¦298.”
\v 21 So¦305 God created the great sea¦309 creatures and every kind of living¦315 creature that moves which¦318 the waters¦320 swarm¦319 with, and every kind of winged bird. And God saw¦328 that \add what he had done\add* was good¦332,
\v 22 and he blessed¦334 them, saying, “Be fruitful¦338 and multiply and fill¦340 the waters¦343 in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth¦347.”
\v 23 Then¦349 evening¦351 came, and \add later\add* morning¦354 came, \add and that was the end of\add* the fifth¦356 day¦355.
\p
\v 24 Then God¦360 said, “Let the land bring forth every kind of living creature: livestock¦366 and every crawling creature and every kind of living thing on the earth¦362.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 25 so he made every kind of creature of the earth¦381, and every kind of livestock, and every kind of crawling creature on the ground. And God¦377 saw¦393 that \add what he had done\add* was good¦397.
\p
\v 26 Then¦399 God¦400 said¦399, “Let us make man in our image¦403, according¦404 to our likeness¦404, and let them rule over the fish¦406 in the sea¦407 and over the birds in the sky and over the livestock and over all the earth, and over every creature moving on the earth.”\x + \xo 1:26: \xt 1Cor 11:7.\x*
\v 27 Then¦422 God created humankind¦427 in his image, \add yes,\add* created in the image of God—male and female¦434 he created them.\x + \xo 1:27-28: \xt Gen 5:1-2.\x*
\v 28 Then¦438 God¦440 blessed¦438 them and told them, “Be fruitful¦444 and multiply, and fill¦446 the earth and take control of it. You're in charge of the fish¦452 in the sea¦453 and the birds in the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
\v 29 Then¦464 God¦465 said, “Look, I've given you every plant¦473 throughout the whole earth¦483 that yields seed, and every tree that has fruit¦492 with a seed or seeds inside it. They will be yours for food,
\v 30 and to every living thing on the earth, and to every bird in the sky, and to everything moving on the earth that has living breath in it, I've given every green¦524 plant¦525 for food.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 31 and he saw¦531 everything that he'd made, and wow, it was \em very\em* good¦541. Then¦533 evening¦545 came, and \add later\add* morning¦548 came, \add and that was the end of\add* the sixth¦550 day¦549.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 So the heavens¦554 and the earth¦555 were completed¦553, along with everything in them.
\v 2 By the seventh day God¦561 had finished his work, so he rested¦567 on the seventh day from all his work that he'd done.\x + \xo 2:2-3: \xt Exo 20:11.\x*
\v 3 Then¦576 God¦577 blessed¦576 the seventh¦581 day¦580 and declared it to be different from the other days, because on that \add first Saturday\add*, he rested¦586 from all his work of creating¦592.

\p
\v 4 What follows tells\f + \fr 2:4 \ft This little formula is sometimes known as a ‘toledoth’ (or ‘tōlədōt’, from the Hebrew word) and seems to mark a new section, but it's debated whether this part belongs at the bottom of the previous section, or at the top of the following section. We're assuming the later here.\f* \add more details about\add* the history of what God did when he created¦601 the heavens and the earth:
\rem /s1 The Garden of Eden; The Man and Woman in Eden; Another Account of the Creation
\p During the time when Yahweh God\f + \fr 2:4 \ft This is the first occurrence of the Hebrew letters ‘יהוה’ (YHWH) in the Bible, which we find out later (in Exodus 3, also compiled by Mosheh/Moses) is God's actual name. Although the vowels which go with those four consonants have been lost over the millennia, most scholars believe ‘Yahweh’ to be the best guess that we can make. (It's certainly NOT ‘Jehovah’, which was a historical mistake made by confusing the vowels of two different words.) Some older translations use \sc LORD\sc* which is NOT a translation of ‘יהוה’ (which means ‘I am’), but which represents confusion over the more recent Jewish (but non-Biblical) custom of not pronouncing God's name (and which makes one wonder what's the use of telling people your name if they're then not allowed to use it).\f* made the earth and the heavens,
\v 5 there weren't yet any bushes growing on the earth¦615, and no plants had yet sprung up in the fields, because Yahweh¦625 God¦626 had not yet made it rain, and nor were there any people yet to till the ground.
\v 6 However¦643, a mist came¦638 up from the ground and watered¦642 the entire¦645 surface¦647 of the land.
\p
\v 7 Then¦654 Yahweh¦652 God¦653 formed¦651 the \add first\add* man out of the dust on the ground and he breathed into his nostrils¦662 the breath of life¦664, and the man became a living person.\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 1Cor 15:45.\x*
\p
\v 8 Now in the east, Yahweh¦671 God¦672 had planted¦670 a garden¦673 in Eden¦675, and he put the man there¦678 that he had formed¦683.
\v 9 He \add also\add* caused all kinds of trees to grow there—\add some\add* that are pleasant to look at and good for food. In the middle¦700 of the garden¦701 was the tree of life¦699 and the tree of the knowledge¦703 of good and evil\x + \xo 2:9: \xt Rev 2:7; 22:2,14.\x*
\p
\v 10 A river¦707 flowed out of Eden¦710 to water¦711 the garden¦714, and then from there¦715 it split into four¦718 rivers.
\v 11 The first river was named Pishon¦723, and it¦724 winds around¦725 through the entire¦727 region of Havilah¦730, where¦731 there's¦733 gold¦734.
\v 12 The gold¦736 from there is \add very pure\add*, and there's also \add a type of fragrant resin\add* and onyx \add gemstones\add* there.
\v 13 The second¦748 river¦747 was named Gihon¦749, and it¦750 winds through the entire¦753 region of Cush¦756.
\v 14 The third¦760 river was named Tigris¦761, and it flowed east of the Asshur¦765 \add region\add*, and then the fourth¦767 river was \add named\add* Frat.
\p
\v 15 Yahweh¦772 God¦773 took¦771 the man and put him in the garden¦778 at Eden¦774 to cultivate and maintain it
\v 16 and instructed¦784 him, “You¦785 can eat as much \add fruit\add* as you want from any tree¦792 in the garden¦794,
\v 17 but you mustn't eat from the tree¦798 of the knowledge¦799 of good and evil, because the day¦806 you eat its \add fruit\add* you'll certainly die.”
\p
\v 18 Then¦812 Yahweh¦813 God¦814 said¦812, “It's not good¦817 for the man to be alone¦820, so I'll make a suitable helper¦825 for him.”
\p
\v 19 Now¦838 Yahweh¦829 God¦830 had formed¦828 every living thing of the field¦837 and every bird of the sky from the ground, so he brought¦843 them to the man to see what he would call them, and whatever the man called¦855 each living creature¦859, that would become its name¦862.
\v 20 The man gave names¦866 to all the \add various\add* livestock and to the birds of the sky and to every living creature in the fields¦874, but none of them was a suitable \add companion\add* to help him.
\p
\v 21 So¦882 Yahweh¦883 God¦884 caused the man to go into a deep sleep, and then while he was sleeping, he removed one of his ribs and closed¦894 up \add over\add* its place with flesh¦895.
\v 22 Then¦902 Yahweh¦899 God¦900 used the rib which¦905 he had taken¦907 from the man to form into a woman¦911, and he brought¦912 her to the man,
\v 23 and the man said:
\q1 “Now this is bone from my bones¦922
\q2 and flesh from my flesh.
\q1 She'll be named ‘woman¦927’
\q2 because she came from a man.”
\m
\v 24 So that's why a man¦939 leaves¦937 his father¦942 and mother¦945, and becomes united to his wife, and the two of them become one being.\x + \xo 2:24: \xt Mat 19:5; Mrk 10:7-8; 1Cor 6:16; Eph 5:31.\x*
\p
\v 25 At that time, both the man and his wife were naked¦954, but they had no sense of shame.

\s1 The couple disobey God
\rem /s1 The Fall of Man; Human Disobedience; The Man and Woman Sin; The First Sin and Its Punishment
\p
\v 1 Now the snake¦960 was the craftiest¦962 of all the animals¦964 that Yahweh¦968 God had created, and \add one day\add* he asked the woman¦973, “Did God really command you to not eat¦980 \add fruit\add* from any of the trees in the garden¦983?”\x + \xo 3:1: \xt Rev 12:9; 20:2.\x*
\p
\v 2 “No,” answered the woman¦986, “we¦994 can eat¦994 the fruit¦990 from \add any\add* of the trees in the garden¦993,
\v 3 except from the tree¦997 that is in the centre. He commanded \add us\add* to not eat¦1005 that fruit¦996 or even touch¦1008 it, because if we do, we will die¦1012!”
\p
\v 4 But¦1014 the serpent said to the woman¦1018, “It's not definite that you'll die.
\v 5 Actually, God knows that as soon as you eat¦1029 fruit from that tree, you'll understand new things, so that you will know \add what's\add* right and \add what's\add* wrong just like God does.”
\p
\v 6 The woman¦1040 saw that the tree's \add fruit looked\add* good to eat and that the tree itself was very attractive, plus she wanted \add to eat\add* the fruit so that it would make her wise. So¦1039 she picked some of the fruit and ate it and she also gave \add some of it\add* to her husband¦1059 \add who was there\add* with her, and he ate it \add too\add*.
\v 7 \add Immediately\add* they both had new understanding and they felt their¦1065 nakedness¦1068. So¦1063 they sewed¦1070 \add some\add* fig¦1072 leaves together and made skirts for themselves.
\p
\v 8 \add Late that afternoon,\add* during the cool time of the day¦1086, the man and his wife heard¦1077 Yahweh¦1081 God's voice as he walked in the garden, but they hid from him behind some trees in the garden,
\v 9 so Yahweh¦1098 God¦1099 called¦1097 out to the man, “\add Adam,\add* where¦1105 are you?”
\p
\v 10 “I heard¦1111 you \add walking\add* in the garden¦1112,” he replied, “but I was scared because I was naked¦1116, so I hid \add myself¦1118\add*.”
\p
\v 11 “Who told you that you're naked¦1125?” Yahweh God asked. “Have you eaten¦1136 \add the fruit\add* that I told you not to eat¦1133?”
\p
\v 12 “The woman¦1140 that you put here beside me,” answered the man, “she gave¦1145 me \add some\add* fruit from the tree¦1150 and I ate¦1151 it.”
\p
\v 13 Then¦1153 Yahweh¦1154 God¦1155 asked the woman, “What did you do?”\x + \xo 3:13: \xt 2Cor 11:3; 1Tim 2:14.\x*
\p “The snake¦1163 tricked me, so I ate \add some of the fruit\add*,” the woman replied.

\p
\v 14 Then¦1167 Yahweh¦1168 God¦1169 said¦1167 to the snake¦1173,
\q1 “Because you've done this you'll be cursed¦1177 more than all the livestock,
\q2 and more than every living thing in the fields¦1184.
\q1 \add Now\add* you'll move along on your belly¦1187,
\q2 and you'll eat¦1190 dust all the rest of your life¦1194.
\q1
\v 15 I'll put hostility¦1196 between you and the woman¦1201
\q2 between your descendants and hers.
\q1 He will crush your head
\q2 and you'll strike his heel.”\x + \xo 3:15: \xt Rev 12:17.\x*
\p
\v 16 To the woman¦1216 God said¦1217,
\q1 “I'll sharply increase your pain in childbirth.
\q2 You'll produce children¦1224 in pain.
\q1 Your desire will be for your husband
\q2 and he will rule over you.”
\p
\v 17 Then \add God\add* said to the man,\x + \xo 3:17-18: \xt Heb 6:8.\x*
\q1 “Because you did what your wife told you
\q2 and ate¦1243 from that tree¦1246
\q2 that I'd told you not to eat from,
\q1 then the ground will be cursed¦1253 because of you.
\q1 You'll have to work hard to get food from it
\q2 all the rest of your life¦1260.
\q1
\v 18 It'll¦1267 produce thorns¦1262 and thistles for you
\q2 although you'll eat¦1266 the crops of the fields¦1270.
\q1
\v 19 You'll eat bread with sweat drops on your nose
\q2 until¦1276 you return to the ground
\q2 because you were taken¦1283 out of the ground.
\q1 \add Yes,\add* you were \add created\add* from dust,
\q2 and you'll return back to dust.”
\p
\v 20 Then¦1293 the man named his wife ‘Havvah¦1297’ \add (which means ‘living¦1304’)\add* because she would become the mother¦1301 of all future people.
\v 21 Then¦1306 Yahweh¦1307 God¦1308 made clothes¦1313 from \add animal\add* skins for Adam¦1309 and his wife¦1310 and he dressed them.
\s1 The humans get expelled from the garden

\p
\v 22 Then Yahweh¦1318 God¦1319 said¦1316, “See, the man has become¦1322 like one of us, being aware of good¦1326 and evil. But now, he mustn't \add be allowed\add* to reach out his hand¦1333 and also take¦1334 \add fruit\add* from the tree¦1336 of life¦1337 and eat¦1338 it and live¦1339 forever¦1340.”\x + \xo 3:22: \xt Rev 22:14.\x*
\v 23 So¦1342 Yahweh¦1343 God¦1344 expelled \add them\add* out of the garden¦1345 in Eden¦1347 to work the soil from which \add Adam\add* had been taken¦1353.
\p
\v 24 After he expelled them, he placed sentries on the east side of the garden¦1362 in Eden¦1364, as well as a fiery sword¦1370 that swung around in every direction to guard¦1372 the path¦1375 to the tree¦1376 of life¦1377.

\p
\v 1 Then Adam slept with his wife, and she conceived¦1386 and \add in due course \add* gave birth¦1387 to Kayin (Cain¦1390). “Yahweh¦1396 has enabled me to produce a man,” she said.
\v 2 \add Eventually\add* she also gave birth¦1399 to Kayin's brother, Abel. Abel became a shepherd, while Kayin became a crop farmer.
\v 3 Some \add months\add* later, Kayin brought¦1419 some of what he'd grown in the ground as an offering¦1423 to Yahweh¦1424,
\v 4 and also Abel brought¦1427 the best portions from some of the firstborn¦1431 of his flock¦1432. Now Yahweh¦1435 was pleased with Abel and his offering,\x + \xo 4:4: \xt Heb 11:4.\x*
\v 5 but he¦1450 didn't even look towards Kayin and his offering. Kayin got very angry and his face showed his displeasure.
\v 6 Then¦1457 Yahweh¦1458 said¦1457 to Kayin, “Why are you so angry? And why are you frowning like that?
\v 7 If you do what's right, won't you be honoured? But if you don't¦1469 do what's right, sin¦1478 is crouching¦1479 in the doorway wanting to have you, but you have the control over it.”
\p
\v 8 \add One day,\add* Kayin spoke to his brother Abel¦1491 when they were \add out\add* in the field¦1495, and then Kayin attacked him and killed¦1502 him.\x + \xo 4:8: \xt Mat 23:35; Luk 11:51; 1Yhn 3:12.\x*
\p
\v 9 \add Later\add* Yahweh¦1505 asked Kayin, “Where's your brother Abel¦1510?”
\p “I don't¦1513 know¦1514,” he replied, “It's not my job to look after my brother.”
\p
\v 10 “What have you¦1521 done?” Yahweh asked. “Your brother's¦1524 blood¦1523 is calling out to me from the ground.\x + \xo 4:10: \xt Heb 12:24.\x*
\v 11 So¦1531 now you're cursed¦1532 and banished from the soil that your brother's¦1546 blood¦1545 soaked into as a result of your actions.
\v 12 Whenever you till \add and plant\add* the ground, it¦1556 will no longer produce good yields for you. You'll be a fugitive and wandering¦1561 \add refugee\add* on the earth¦1564.”
\p
\v 13 “My punishment is more than I can bear,” Kayin \add complained\add* to Yahweh¦1570.
\v 14 “Look, you're now driving me \add away\add* from the ground \add I've been cultivating\add* to somewhere where you won't be able to see me. I'll be a wandering¦1585 \add refugee\add* on the earth¦1587, and anyone who finds me will kill me.”
\p
\v 15 “Very well,”, replied Yahweh and¦1604 declared, “If anyone kills¦1600 Kayin, then that person will receive a seven¦1602 times greater \add sentence\add*.” Then¦1594 Yahweh marked Kayin so that no one who found him would kill him,

\v 1 When¦2255 people began¦2257 to multiply on the earth's surface¦2262, and¦2264 they¦2265 were having daughters¦2264,\x + \xo 6:1-4: \xt Yob 1:6; 2:1.\x*
\v 2 God's¦2272 sons¦2269 saw¦2268 that men's daughters¦2274 were beautiful, and they took¦2279 any that they wanted for themselves as wives¦2281.
\v 3 Then¦2286 Yahweh¦2287 said¦2286, “My Spirit won't tolerate people forever, because they¦2297 are physical beings, therefore their \add remaining¦2290\add* time will be 120 years.”
\v 4 The NEFILIM were on the earth¦2305 in those days¦2306 and also after¦2309 that, when the sons¦2314 of God¦2315 went¦2313 to the daughters¦2318 of humankind¦2319 and they bore children for them.

\v 6 So¦2353 Yahweh¦2349 regretted that he had made humankind¦2355 on the earth¦2356 and he was deeply saddened,
\v 7 so he said¦2362, “This humankind that I created, I will completely destroy them from the surface¦2372 of the ground, along with the animals¦2377, and crawling creatures and the birds of the sky, because I regret¦2386 that I made them.”
\v 8 However, Yahweh¦2394 noticed Noah and was pleased with him.

\p
\v 9 This is the account¦2398 of Noah¦2399: He was a man¦2401 who obeyed God, blameless¦2403 among the people of his time and he walked¦2409 around with God.\x + \xo 6:9: \xt 2Pe 2:5.\x*
\v 10 Noah¦2414 had three¦2415 sons¦2416: Yafet (Japheth¦2425), Shem¦2419, and¦2423 Ham.
\p
\v 11 Now God¦2430 noticed that \add humankind\add* was corrupt and very violent¦2433.
\v 12 \add Yes,\add* God¦2436 looked at the earth, and wow, all the living creatures on the earth had corrupted¦2441 their behaviour.
\p
\v 13 So God¦2457 told Noah¦2458, “I've decided to put an end¦2459 to all people on earth because the earth is filled with violence¦2469 because of them. So listen, I myself am going to destroy¦2472 all of them, along with the earth.

If you think about the ‘ark of the covenant’ that uses the same word, hopefully you can understand how anything like a ‘boat’ is the wrong word picture, hence we've gone back to translating the actual Hebrew word here.\f* out of cypress.

\v 15 These¦2497 are the dimensions for it: 140m long, 23m wide, and¦2506 14m high.
\v 16 It must have a roof, but the last half a metre between the sides and the roof should remain open. Put the door¦2520 in its side, and build lower¦2524, middle, and upper decks.
\v 17 You see¦2530, I'm going to flood¦2534 the earth with water¦2535 to destroy¦2539 every creature that breathes¦2546. Everything that's on the earth will die¦2554.
\v 18 \add But¦2556\add* I'll¦2557 make an agreement with you, so you must go into this chest along with your wife¦2567 and sons¦2566 and their wives¦2568,
\v 19 and you must take a pair, male and female¦2588, of everything¦2573 that lives into the chest to keep¦2585 alive¦2585 with you.

\p
\v 11 When Noah¦2810 was 600 years old (and around the beginning of May), deep underwater geysers in the ocean started spouting out water, and the skies began to drop heavy rain\x + \xo 7:11: \xt 2Pe 3:6.\x*
\v 12 that continued day and night¦2838 for forty¦2835 days.
\v 13 That was the very day¦2841 that Noah¦2844 and Yafet and Shem and Ham and their wives¦2855 had all entered the \add wooden\add* chest.
\v 14 They had with them every kind of living¦2866 creature, including every kind of livestock and every \add other\add* kind of creature that lives on the land, and every kind of bird \add and\add* everything \add else\add* that flies.
\v 15 They had come to Noah¦2893 \add in order\add* to enter the chest—two by two of every creature with the breath¦2905 of life¦2906.
\v 16 So¦2908 \add pairs of\add* males and females¦2910 of every creature entered¦2908 just as God¦2918 had instructed¦2916 \add Noah¦2917\add*, then Yahweh¦2920 \add closed¦2919 the door and\add* they¦2914 were shut in.
\p
\v 17 Then¦2933 the flood¦2924 came onto the earth for forty¦2925 days, and the water¦2931 rose so that the \add wooden\add* chest was lifted¦2932 up right off the land.
\v 18 The water continued to rise and get deeper on the earth¦2946, and the chest floated¦2947 along on top of the water.
\v 19 \add Eventually\add* the water on the earth¦2960 got so deep that all the high¦2965 mountains¦2964 everywhere under the sky were under water—

\v 21 \add By\add* then every living creature that lived on the earth had drowned—birds¦2991, livestock, animals¦2993, every creature that swarms¦2996 upon the earth, and all humankind¦3002.
\v 22 Everything that \add had\add* the breath of the spirit of life¦3009 in its nostrils¦3010, everything that \add lived\add* on dry land, died¦3014.
\v 23 That's how \add Yahweh\add* completely annihilated every living¦3021 creature off the earth¦3043, including humankind¦3029 and livestock and crawling creatures and \add even\add* the birds.

\p
\v 1 Then¦3062 God¦3063 considered Noah¦3066 and and all the living¦3070 things and all the livestock that were with him in the \add floating\add* chest¦3078, and he caused a wind¦3081 to pass over the earth¦3084, and the waters¦3086 \add started to\add* subside¦3085
\v 2 and the underwater geysers and the rain was stopped.
\v 3 Then¦3099 the water steadily receded¦3104 from the earth¦3102 and after five months the water had gone down \add enough\add*
\v 4 that by October the \add wooden\add* chest was left sitting on one of the Ararat¦3123 mountains¦3122.
\v 5 The water¦3125 continued to recede¦3128 until¦3129 December when the tops of the mountains¦3137 became visible.

\v 6 Then¦3139 after another forty¦3141 days, Noah¦3144 opened¦3143 a window¦3147 near the \add top\add* of the chest
\v 7 and he released a raven¦3155 which kept flying out and returning¦3158 until¦3159 the land started to dry out.

\v 9 but the dove didn't find anywhere to land so it returned¦3186 to the window because the surface¦3196 of the earth¦3199 was still wet, and he stretched out his arm and brought¦3203 the dove back inside.
\v 10 Noah¦3217 waited¦3210 another week and then he released the dove¦3219 again¦3211
\v 11 and it returned to him in the evening¦3228 and wow, it had a fresh¦3233, green olive¦3232 leaf in its beak. So¦3224 now Noah¦3236 knew¦3235 that the land was out of the water¦3240.
\v 12 Then¦3250 he waited¦3244 another week, and released the dove¦3252 \add again\add*, but this time it didn't come back to him.
\p
\v 13 So it was when Noah was 601 years old (in the month¦3269 of WHAT MONTH on the first day of the \add Jewish\add* new year¦3266) the land was still drying out.

\v 14 By the end of the next month, the land was fully dry.

\v 15 Then God¦3297 said to Noah¦3300,

\v 18 So¦3344 Noah¦3346 went¦3344 outside, along with his sons¦3347 and¦3348 each of their wives¦3349.
\v 19 Every¦3354 living¦3356 creature, every crawling thing¦3359 and every bird, everything moving on the earth¦3367, went¦3369 outside kind by kind.

\v 18 Noah's¦3742 sons¦3740 who came¦3743 out of the \add wooden\add* chest \add after the flood\add* were Yafet¦3749 (Japheth), Shem¦3747, and Ham. (Ham became Canaan's¦3753 father¦3752).
\v 19 They were Noah's¦3759 three sons¦3757 and from them the whole earth¦3764 became populated.
\p
\v 20 \add After a while,\add* Noah¦3767, who was a farmer, planted¦3770 \add some grape\add* vines,
\v 21 and \add in due course\add* he drank¦3773 some of \add his\add* wine and got drunk¦3777, and he \add fell asleep\add* naked in his tent.
\v 22 Then Ham (Canaan's¦3786 father) saw his father's nakedness¦3788 then went outside¦3794 and told his brothers¦3793 \add what he'd seen\add*.
\v 23 So¦3796 Shem¦3797 and Yafet¦3798 took¦3796 a robe, and holding it between their shoulders¦3805 they walked¦3807 backwards into the tent and covered¦3809 their father's¦3812 nakedness. (Their¦3806 faces¦3813 were towards the tent entrance, so they didn't see his nakedness.)
\v 24 \add Eventually,\add* Noah¦3821 woke up from his drunken sleep and¦3823 found out what his youngest¦3831 son (Ham) had done to him
\v 25 and said¦3833, “May Canaan¦3835 be cursed¦3834 and become a slave¦3836 of slaves¦3837 to his brothers¦3839!”
\v 26 Then¦3841 he added, “Praise Yahweh¦3843 who's Shem's God¦3844. May Canaan¦3847 become Shem's slave¦3848.
\v 27 May God¦3852 expand Yafet's territory and¦3858 may he¦3851 live in Shem's¦3857 tents¦3855. May Canaan¦3859 also become a slave¦3860 of Yafet.”

\v 24 Arpachshad fathered Shelah, then Shelah fathered Eber¦4162.
\v 25 Eber's two sons were Peleg and Yoktan. (Peleg's¦4170 name \add means ‘division’,\add* because it was during his lifetime that the earth¦4174 was divided¦4173.\f + \fr 10:25 \ft Often believed to refer to the division of languages after the building of the tower described in chapter 11.\f*)

\rem /s1 The Tower of Babel; The Tower of Babylon
\p
\v 1 Now the whole world had a single language¦4265 and the same words¦4267,
\v 2 and as they migrated from the east, they discovered a plain¦4274 in the Shinar¦4276 region and settled there¦4278.
\v 3 Then¦4280 they said¦4280 to each other, “Come on, let's make bricks and cure them with fire.” So¦4280 they had bricks instead of stones¦4293, and they had tar for mortar¦4297.
\p
\v 4 Then¦4299 they said¦4299, “Come on, let's build¦4302 a city¦4305 for ourselves and a tower¦4306 with its¦4307 top in the sky, and let's make a reputation for ourselves, so that we don't get scattered¦4315 all over the whole earth¦4321.”
\v 5 Then¦4323 Yahweh¦4324 came down to see the city¦4328 and¦4329 the tower¦4331 that the humans¦4335 were building
\v 6 and he said¦4337, “Look, they're \add just\add* one people¦4340 group, and they all speak the same language¦4342. This is only the beginning¦4346 of what they can do \add together\add*—soon they'll be capable of doing anything they plan to do.
\v 7 Come on then, let's go down and confuse¦4360 their¦4362 language so that they won't be able to understand¦4365 each other's words.”
\v 8 So¦4372 then they¦4380 stopped¦4380 building¦4381 the city¦4382 and Yahweh¦4371 caused them to scatter¦4370 over the whole world.
\v 9 That's¦4401 why they named the city ‘Babel¦4389’ \add (meaning ‘mixed-up’)\add* because it was there that Yahweh¦4394 mixed up everyone's language¦4395 and then scattered¦4400 them over the whole world.

\v 2 they went to war against Bera king of Sodom¦5416, Birsha¦5419 king of Gomorrah¦5421, Shinab¦5422 king of Admah¦5425, Shemeber¦5426 king of Zeboiim¦5428, and the king of Bela¦5432 (also known as Tso'ar).
\v 3 Those latter five kings joined¦5440 forces in the Siddim¦5444 valley (also known as the Salt Sea valley).
\v 4 They had been subject to King Kedorlaomer¦5455 for twelve years, but in the thirteenth year¦5459 they rebelled¦5460.
\p
\v 5 Then¦5462 in the fourteenth year¦5464, Kedorlaomer¦5466 and the kings¦5467 who were with him went¦5465 and attacked the Rephaim¦5473 in Ashteroth¦5474-Karnaim, and the Zuzim¦5478 in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-Kiriathaim,
\v 6 and the Horites¦5487 in the hill country¦5488 of Se'ir as far as El Paran¦5492, which¦5493 is near the wilderness¦5496.
\v 7 Then¦5498 \add those four kings\add* turned¦5498 back and went¦5499 to En Mishpat¦5503 (also called Kadesh¦5505) and they¦5499 attacked the entire¦5509 territories of the Amalekites¦5512 and also the Amorites¦5516, who were living in Hazezon Tamar.
\p
\v 8 Then¦5521 the king of Sodom¦5524, the king of Gomorrah¦5526, the king of Admah¦5528, the king of Zeboiim¦5530, and the king of Bela¦5533 (also called Zoar) went out into the Siddim¦5541 Valley and arranged \add their troops\add* for battle¦5539
\v 9 against Kedorlaomer¦5544 king of Elam¦5546, Tidal¦5547 king of Goiim¦5549, Amraphel¦5550 king of Shinar¦5552, Arioch¦5553 king of Ellasar¦5555—five kings¦5557 \add defending themselves\add* against the four.
\v 10 Now the Siddim¦5563 Valley had many tar pits, and when the kings of Sodom¦5571 and Gomorrah fled, they¦5578 fell into the pits, \add but\add* the rest fled up into the hills.
\v 11 Then¦5580 \add the four attacking kings\add* took¦5580 all the \add peoples'\add* possessions¦5585 from Sodom¦5586 and Gomorrah¦5587 and all their¦5592 food and left.

\v 12 Abram's¦5605 nephew Lot¦5598 and all his possessions¦5601 also got taken because he was living¦5608 in \add the city of\add* Sodom¦5609,
\v 13 \add but\add* someone who escaped¦5612 came and reported \add this news\add* to Abram the Hebrew¦5615. \add At that time,\add* Abram was \add still\add* living¦5617 by the terebinth trees of Mamre¦5619 the Amorite¦5620, the brother of Eshcol¦5622 and the brother of Aner, and the three of them had formed an alliance \add together\add*.
\v 14 When¦5637 Abram¦5632 heard that his nephew had been taken¦5634 captive¦5634, he led out his 318 trained¦5639 men¦5639 who'd \add all\add* been born in his house¦5641, and he pursued¦5646 his enemies as far as \add the town of\add* Dan¦5649.
\v 15 During the night¦5654, Abram split in his slaves into groups and they attacked \add the four kings and their soldiers\add* and pursued¦5658 them to Hobah¦5661 (north¦5663 of Damascus¦5664).
\v 16 They were able to bring back all the possessions, as well as his nephew Lot¦5674 and his possessions, and also the women¦5681 and the \add other\add* people¦5684 \add who'd been captured\add*.

\p
\v 1 After those events, Yahweh¦5830 spoke to Abram in a vision¦5834, telling him, “Don't be afraid, Abram, because I'll protect you and I'll generously and richly reward¦5843 you.”
\p
\v 2 “My¦5856 master¦5849 Yahweh¦5850,” replied Abram¦5848, “what will you¦5853 give¦5853 me, since we have no children¦5858 and it's Eliezer¦5865 (\add my chief slave\add* from Damascus¦5864) who'll inherit all my possessions?”
\v 3 Then¦5867 he continued, \add Yes¦5868,\add* you¦5872 haven't given¦5872 me a child so wow, my heir is a slave from my household¦5877!”
\p
\v 4 Then¦5881 listen, Yahweh's¦5884 word¦5882 came to \add Abram\add* saying, “That man won't be your heir, but on the contrary, it'll be your biological son.”
\v 5 Then \add Yahweh\add* took \add Abram\add* outside¦5901 and said, “Look up at the sky and see if you can count the stars¦5908.” Then he said to him, “Your descendants will be like that.”\x + \xo 15:5: \xt Rom 4:18; Heb 11:12.\x*
\p
\v 6 \add Abram\add* believed¦5920 in Yahweh, and¦5922 \add Yahweh considered¦5922 that faith of Abram's as an act of obedience\add*.\x + \xo 15:6: \xt Rom 4:3; Gal 3:6; Jam 2:23.\x*
\p
\v 7 Then¦5926 Yahweh told \add Abram\add*, “I'm Yahweh who brought¦5931 you out of Ur (where the Chaldeans lived) so I could give¦5934 you this land to possess¦5940 it.”
\p
\v 8 “My master¦5943 Yahweh¦5944,” Abram asked, “how will I know¦5946 that I will possess¦5948 it¦5948?”
\p
\v 9 “Bring me a three-year-old heifer¦5954,” Yahweh replied, “and a three-year-old she-goat and a three-year-old ram and a turtledove¦5960 and a young¦5961 pigeon¦5961.”
\v 10 So¦5963 \add Abram\add* brought all those to \add Yahweh\add*, and then he¦5985 cut the animals (but not the birds¦5982) in half down the middle and laid the halves opposite¦5978 to each other.
\v 11 Then¦5993 \add some\add* birds¦5988 of prey flew down to the carcasses¦5991, \add but\add* Abram¦5994 shooed them away.
\p
\v 12 Later as the sun¦5997 was going¦5998 down, Abram¦6003 fell into a deep sleep¦5999, and it suddenly became completely dark and he became terrified,\x + \xo 15:12: \xt Yob 4:13-14.\x*
\v 13 and \add Yahweh\add* said¦6011 to Abram¦6012, “Know for certain¦6013 that your descendants will be strangers in a land that doesn't belong to them, and they will serve the \add rulers of that land\add* and \add those rulers\add* will persecute them for 400 years.\x + \xo 15:13: \xt Exo 1:1-14; Acts 7:6.\x*
\v 14 \add But¦6031 just as certain\add*, I'll¦6038 punish the nation¦6034 that they serve¦6036 and after¦6039 that they'll come¦6042 out with many possessions¦6043.\x + \xo 15:14: \xt Exo 12:40-41; Acts 7:7.\x*
\v 15 And \add as for\add* you, you'll go¦6047 to your ancestors¦6050 in peace¦6051—you'll be buried¦6052 at a good¦6054 old age.
\v 16 Then¦6056 in the fourth¦6057 generation¦6056 \add your descendants\add* will come back here, because the Amorites' sins won't be complete¦6063 until¦6066 then.”
\p
\v 17 Then¦6070 the sun went down and darkness came, and wow, there was a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch¦6078 that passed¦6081 between¦6082 those \add animal halves\add*.

\p
\v 1 Now Abram's¦6146 wife¦6145 Sarai¦6144 hadn't been able to give him any children¦6148, but she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar¦6154,
\v 2 so Sarai said¦6156 to Abram, “Listen, Yahweh¦6165 has prevented¦6164 me from having children¦6166 so please¦6163 sleep with my slave¦6172. Perhaps I can have a family through her.” Abram agreed to what Sarai had suggested.
\v 3 So¦6182 Sarai¦6183, the wife of Abram, took Hagar¦6189, her Egyptian slave¦6191, after Abram had lived¦6195 ten years¦6194 in the land of Canaan¦6198, and gave her to Abram her husband¦6202 as a wife for him.
\v 4 So¦6206 he slept with Hagar¦6209 and she got pregnant¦6210, but once she realised that she began to despise her¦6215 mistress¦6215.
\p
\v 5 So¦6218 Sarai¦6219 \add complained\add* to Abram¦6222, “This is all your fault. I let you sleep with my¦6223 slave¦6227, but now that she's pregnant she looks down on me. May Yahweh¦6235 judge¦6234 between¦6236 me and you.”
\p
\v 6 “Listen,” Abram¦6241 replied, “She's \em your¦6252\em* slave¦6246 to do what she's told. Do whatever you¦6252 think best.” So Sarai started mistreating¦6253 Hagar, and so she ran away.
\p
\v 7 Then¦6258 Yahweh's¦6260 messenger¦6259 found¦6258 her¦6258 in the wilderness¦6265 at a spring—the spring beside the road to Shur¦6270,
\v 8 and \add asked\add* her, “Hagar¦6273, Sarai's slave, where have you come¦6279 from and where are you going¦6281?”
\p “I am running away from Sarai, my mistress¦6285,” she \add ≈replied\add*.
\p
\v 9 Then¦6289 Yahweh's¦6292 messenger¦6291 \add instructed\add* her¦6299, “Return to your¦6296 mistress¦6296 and¦6297 do whatever she tells you,”
\v 10 then added, “I'll give you so many descendants that they won't even be able to be counted¦6311 because there'll be so many.”
\v 11 Then¦6314 the messenger¦6316 told her,
\q1 “Listen here: you're pregnant¦6319 and will give birth to a son,
\q1 and you'll name¦6323 him ‘Ishma'el¦6324’ (\add which means ‘God hears’)\add*
\q2 because Yahweh¦6317 has heard your¦6331 cries of misery.
\q1
\v 12 He'll be a wild donkey¦6335 of a man¦6336
\q2 and he'll be hostile to everyone
\q2 and everyone will be against him.
\q1 He'll \add live\add* right in front of his brothers¦6347.”
\p
\v 13 Then¦6350 \add Hagar realised that it was Yahweh¦6353\add* who had spoken¦6360 to her \add and said¦6360\add*, “You're ‘The God who sees me’,” because she¦6360 \add thought\add*, “Did I really¦6361 just see the back of the \add God\add* who sees me?”
\v 14 So that's why that well between Kadesh¦6378 and¦6379 Bered¦6380 is \add now\add* called¦6370 ‘The well of the living one who sees me’.
\p
\v 15 Then¦6382 Hagar¦6383 gave¦6382 birth¦6382 to a son for Abram, and¦6386 Abram named him Ishma'el¦6395.\x + \xo 16:15: \xt Gal 4:22.\x*

\v 18 \add His descendants\add* are certainly going to become a great¦7096 and mighty¦7097 nation¦7095, and all the nations¦7101 of the earth¦7102 will be blessed¦7098 through him \add and them\add*,
\v 19 because I'm aware that he'll command¦7108 his children¦7111 and his household¦7114 after¦7115 him, and they'll follow Yahweh's path¦7117 by their right¦7120 and just behaviour, so that Yahweh will bring¦7123 about for Abraham¦7127 what he's said to him.”
\p
\v 20 Then¦7134 Yahweh¦7135 said¦7134, “Because there's \add so many people\add* crying out about Sodom¦7137 and Gomorrah, and because their¦7142 sin¦7142 is very grievous,
\v 21 I'll go¦7147 down \add there\add* now and see¦7150 if what I've heard about them is true, and if not, I'll also find that out.”
\p
\v 22 Then¦7162 the \add other two\add* men¦7164 left and starting descending toward¦7166 Sodom¦7166, and Abraham¦7167 was still standing¦7169 there¦7163 in front¦7170 of Yahweh¦7171,
\v 23 so he went¦7173 closer \add to Yahweh\add* and¦7175 asked, “Will you¦7177 really destroy obedient people along with those who're evil?
\v 24 What if there¦7184 were fifty people in the city \add who've obeyed you\add*? Would you really¦7189 destroy the city and all its¦7199 people and not save it for the sake of those fifty?
\v 25 Surely you wouldn't do anything like that—killing the good people along with the evil ones, so that they all just get treated the same? Certainly you wouldn't do that? Wouldn't the one who judges¦7217 the entire¦7218 world be more fair?”
\p
\v 26 “If I find fifty¦7231 godly people in Sodom¦7230,” Yahweh¦7226 answered, “then I'll spare¦7235 the whole city¦7234 for their¦7239 sake.”
\p
\v 27 “Listen, I've been bold enough to \add question\add* my master¦7251, even though I'm \add just\add* dust and ashes¦7254,” Abraham¦7242 said¦7243 again.
\v 28 “Suppose they're five short of the fifty¦7258? Would you destroy the whole city¦7267 because of five?”
\p “I won't destroy it if I find forty-five¦7275 there¦7274,” he replied.
\p
\v 29 Abraham continued to make his request, “Suppose there's forty there?”
\p “I won't do it for the sake of the forty,” he agreed.
\p
\v 30 My master¦7298, don't¦7294 get angry but let me speak¦7299,” Abraham said, “suppose thirty are found¦7301 there?”
\p “I won't do it if I find thirty-five there,” he said.
\p
\v 31 “Listen, I've taken it upon myself to speak¦7318 to my master¦7321,” Abraham asked again, “suppose twenty are found¦7323 there¦7324?”
\p “I won't do it for the sake of the twenty,” he agreed.
\p
\v 32 “My master¦7337, don't¦7333 get angry and let me speak¦7338 one last time¦7341,” Abraham added, “suppose ten are found¦7343 there¦7344?”
\p “I won't do it for the sake of the ten,” Yahweh¦7337 conceded
\v 33 and then he left and Abraham¦7353 returned¦7361 home.

\p
\v 1 So¦7364 the two¦7365 messengers¦7366 arrived at Sodom¦7373 in the evening¦7368, and Lot was sitting¦7370 at the city gate. When Lot saw¦7374 them, he got up to meet them and knelt down in front of them with his face¦7380 to the ground¦7381.
\v 2 Then he said, “Listen, my masters¦7387: Come with me to your slave's¦7393 home and wash your feet¦7396 and stay the night. Then you can get up early¦7397 and continue on your way¦7400.”
\p But¦7383 they said, “No, rather we'll \add just\add* spend¦7394 the night in the street.”
\v 3 However, Lot insisted, so they followed him \add off the main road\add* and went¦7413 into his house¦7416. Then¦7407 he¦7421 prepared a feast¦7419 for them and baked¦7421 unleavened¦7420 bread¦7420, and they ate¦7422.
\p
\v 4 \add However,\add* before they \add went to bed\add*, the men of Sodom¦7429 surrounded¦7430 the house¦7433—there were young¦7434 and old from all parts of the city¦7427—
\v 5 and they called¦7443 out to Lot¦7446, “Where are the men¦7450 who came¦7453 to your place tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can ‘use’ them.”\x + \xo 19:5-8: \xt Jdg 19:22-24.\x*
\p
\v 6 So¦7461 Lot¦7463 went¦7461 out to them at the entrance¦7464 \add of the house\add* and¦7465 shut the door¦7465 behind¦7467 him¦7467
\v 7 and said¦7469, “My brothers¦7473, don't¦7470 do this evil¦7474.
\v 8 Listen, I've got two¦7480 virgin daughters¦7481. Please let me bring¦7487 them out to you and you can treat them however you like. But don't¦7483 do anything¦7502 to these¦7498 men¦7497, because they've entered my house \add and so I'm responsible for them\add*.”
\p
\v 9 But¦7512 they insisted, “Stand back!” Then they said \add to each other\add*, “This guy came to stay with us, and now he's judging us. We'll treat you worse than them!” Then they started pushing hard against Lot¦7530 and came closer to break¦7533 down the door¦7534.
\v 10 But¦7536 the \add two visitors\add* reached¦7536 out their¦7540 hands¦7540 and pulled Lot¦7544 into the house¦7546 and shut the door¦7549 \add again\add*.
\v 11 Then¦7552 they struck¦7559 the men who were at the entrance¦7557 of the house¦7558 with blindness¦7560—\add all of them\add* from the lowly to the prominent men—so that they gave up trying to find the door¦7567.\x + \xo 19:11: \xt 2Ki 6:18.\x*

\p
\v 12 Then¦7569 the men¦7570 said¦7569 to Lot¦7573, “Who else belongs to you here, a son-in-law¦7579 or your sons¦7580 or your daughters¦7581 or anyone else who belongs to you in the city¦7586? Take them out from this place¦7590,
\v 13 because we're \add about¦7594 to\add* destroy it. \add The¦7609 people have repeatedly cried out to\add* Yahweh¦7607, so he's sent¦7608 us to destroy the city.”
\p
\v 14 Then¦7612 Lot¦7613 went¦7612 out and spoke¦7614 to his \add future\add* sons-in-law who were \add engaged\add* to his daughters¦7621, and he told them, “\add Hurry¦7633\add*, get out of this place¦7627, because Yahweh¦7632 is going to destroy¦7631 the city¦7635!” But¦7612 they thought he was just joking.
\p
\v 15 At dawn the next day, the \add two\add* messengers¦7645 urged¦7644 Lot¦7646, saying, “Get up, take¦7649 your wife¦7652 and your two daughters¦7656 who're here, so that all of you won't be swept¦7660 away in the punishment¦7661 of the city¦7662.”
\v 16 When Lot hesitated¦7664, because of Yahweh's¦7676 mercy for him, the men grabbed his hand and his wife's hand and the hands¦7672 of their daughters¦7674, and led them out beyond the edge of the city¦7681.\x + \xo 19:16: \xt 2Pe 2:7.\x*
\v 17 At that point \add one of them\add* told Lot, “Flee for your lives! Don't \add turn around and\add* look¦7694 behind you and don't stop anywhere \add down\add* in the plain¦7701. Escape \add up to\add* the hills so you don't get swept¦7706 away!”
\p
\v 18 \add But¦7708\add* Lot¦7709 \add argued\add*, “Not right now, my masters¦7714.
\v 19 Listen, you've been kind to me and show us mercy by saving¦7728 my life¦7731, but I won't be able to make it to the hills because the disaster¦7740 will overtake¦7739 me and I'll die¦7741.
\v 20 Listen, there's a small town nearby that I could flee to. Let me escape¦7753 there. It's only small. Then my life¦7760 would be saved¦7759.”
\p
\v 21 “Okay then,” the man replied, “I'll also grant your¦7766 request about this so I won't overthrow¦7771 the town that you're talking about.
\v 22 Hurry¦7778 up, escape¦7779 there, because I am not able to do a thing until¦7786 you¦7788 go there.”
\p That's why they \add renamed\add* the town to ‘Zoar’ \add (which means ‘small’)\add*.

\p
\v 23 The sun¦7799 had already risen by the time Lot¦7804 \add and family\add* reached Zoar.
\v 24 Then¦7808 Yahweh¦7819 rained burning sulfur¦7816 down onto Sodom¦7812 and Gomorrah¦7815,\x + \xo 19:24-25: \xt Mat 10:15; 11:23-24; Luk 10:12; 17:29; 2Pe 2:6; Yud 7.\x*
\v 25 and he destroyed those¦7828 cities and all their inhabitants¦7836 as well, as all of the plain¦7832 including all the vegetation.
\v 26 \add But¦7841\add* Lot's wife who was following him¦7843 looked¦7841 back and¦7844 she turned into a pillar¦7845 of salt.\x + \xo 19:26: \xt Luk 17:32.\x*
\p
\v 27 \add Meanwhile,\add* Abraham¦7849 got up early¦7848 in the morning¦7850 and went to the place¦7853 where¦7854 he had stood¦7856 before Yahweh¦7861,

\v 29 So¦7884 it was that when God¦7886 destroyed the cities of the plain¦7890, he remembered¦7891 Abraham¦7895 and had Lot removed out of the middle of the destruction when he destroyed the cities that Lot had been living in.

\p
\v 30 Then¦7912 Lot¦7913 and his two daughters left Zoar and settled up in the hills, because he was afraid¦7921 to stay in Zoar. So¦7912 he lived in a cave \add up there\add* with his two daughters.
\v 31 Then¦7930 the older girl said¦7930 to the younger¦7934, “Dad's old and there¦7938 isn't a \add single\add* man¦7937 \add up here\add* to \add marry\add* us like happens to \add other women\add* in the world.
\v 32 So let's get Dad drunk and then we can lie with him, so that at least we can have some descendants through¦7956 our father¦7951.”
\v 33 So¦7960 then, they got their¦7962 father to drink¦7959 wine that evening, and the oldest daughter went and lay with her father, but he wasn't aware of her coming or going.
\p
\v 34 Then the next day¦7980, the older girl said¦7981 to the younger¦7985, Listen, last night¦7997 I lay with my father. Let's get him drunk again tonight then you go lie with him so that we'll give life to descendants through¦8002 our father.”
\v 35 So¦8009 that next evening also, they got their¦8011 father¦8011 to drink¦8005 wine and the younger¦8014 girl went and lay with him, but \add again\add* he wasn't aware of her coming or going.
\v 36 In that way, both of Lot's¦8027 daughters¦8025 got themselves pregnant¦8023 through their¦8028 father¦8028.
\v 37 Then¦8030 the eldest daughter gave¦8030 birth¦8030 to a son and¦8033 she named him Moab¦8035 \add (which means ‘from my father’)\add*. (He's the ancestor¦8037 of the Moabites to this day¦8042.)

\p
\v 1 Then Abraham¦8067 travelled from there¦8066 to the Negev¦8069 region and he settled between Kadesh¦8073 and Shur¦8075, staying in Gerar¦8077 for a while.
\v 2 Abraham¦8080 had told \add people\add* his wife Sarah was his sister¦8085, so Abimelech¦8088 the king¦8089 of Gerar¦8090 sent¦8087 for Sarah and¦8091 took¦8091 her.\x + \xo 20:2: \xt Gen 12:13; 26:7.\x*
\v 3 \add But¦8096\add* God¦8097 came¦8096 to Abimelech¦8100 in a dream¦8101 in the night¦8102 and told him, “Listen, you're \add as good as\add* dead because of that woman¦8109 you took because she¦8113 is married¦8114 to a husband¦8115.”
\p
\v 4 Now Abimelech¦8117 hadn't gone near to her, so he¦8119 said¦8121, “My master¦8122, would you¦8127 destroy a nation¦8123 even though it's innocent?
\v 5 Didn't Abraham himself tell me that she was his sister¦8134? And she herself also said¦8141 that he was her brother¦8142. I did this with a \add clear conscience\add* and with \add clean\add* hands¦8148.”
\p
\v 6 Then¦8152 God¦8154 said¦8152 to him in the dream¦8155, “Yes, I know¦8158 that you did this with a \add clear conscience\add* and indeed I kept¦8165 you from sinning¦8170 against me. I didn't allow you to touch¦8179 her¦8180 for that reason.
\v 7 So¦8182 now, return that man's wife¦8184 because he's a prophet¦8189, and he'll pray for you and you'll live. But¦8182 if you don't¦8196 return her, be certain that you and all your people will surely¦8201 die.”
\p
\v 8 So¦8210 \add King¦8218\add* Abimelech¦8211 got up early¦8210 in the morning¦8212 and called¦8213 for all of his slaves¦8216 \add to come\add*, and he explained the entire¦8220 situation to them and they were very scared.
\v 9 Then¦8229 he sent for Abraham¦8231 and asked him, “What have you done to us? What did I do to you that you would cause all this trouble for me and my people? What you did to me should never have happened.”
\v 10 Then¦8259 he asked again, “What¦8268 were you thinking when you did that?”
\p
\v 11 “Because I thought that there's¦8278 probably no one around here who \add obeys\add* God¦8281,” replied Abraham¦8274 “so they might kill¦8284 me because of my wife¦8288.
\v 12 \add Besides that,\add* Sarah actually \em is\em* my \add half-\add*sister. We have the same father¦8296, but different mothers¦8302, and¦8303 then it¦8303 was her that I took as a wife.
\v 13 \add Later\add* when God¦8312 got me to leave my father's¦8314 home, I said¦8315 to her, ‘You could do this one kindness¦8318 do for me: Everywhere we¦8327 go¦8327, just tell them that he's your¦8318 brother¦8332.’ ”
\p
\v 14 Then¦8335 \add King¦8342\add* Abimelech¦8336 returned¦8343 Sarah¦8346 his wife to him and also gave him flocks and herds, and male and female¦8340 slaves,

\v 16 Then¦8358 he¦8359 said¦8359 to Sarah, “Listen, I've given 1,000 pieces of silver¦8363 to your brother¦8364. That's for you to demonstrate that you did nothing wrong, so that you're completely cleared.”
\p
\v 17 Then¦8378 Abraham¦8379 prayed¦8378 to God, and God healed¦8383 Abimelech¦8387 and his wife and his slave¦8391 women so that they could have children¦8392,

\p
\v 14 Abraham¦8608 got up early¦8607 the \add next\add* morning¦8610, and got some bread and a skin of water¦8615 and helped Hagar¦8619 put them on her shoulder¦8623.

\p
\v 17 Now God heard the boy's voice, so \add one of\add* God's messengers¦8676 called¦8675 Hagar from heaven¦8684 and said¦8685 to her, “What's the matter, Hagar? Don't be afraid¦8693, because God has heard the boy's voice over there¦8705.
\v 18 Get up and get the boy¦8711 and hold on to him¦8721 by the hand¦8715, because I'll make \add his descendants\add* into a great¦8720 nation¦8719.”

\v 22 \add One day \add King\add* Abimelech¦8770 and Phicol¦8771, the commander¦8772 of his army, spoke to Abraham¦8777, saying, “\add We can see that\add* God¦8779 is with you in everything you do.\add* \x + \xo 21:22: \xt Gen 26:26.\x*

\v 26 “I don't¦8835 know¦8836 who did that,” Abimelech¦8834 responded¦8833, “and you hadn't told me about it, so I've only just heard¦8853 about it today.”
\v 27 Then¦8857 Abraham¦8858 gave¦8861 \add some\add* sheep¦8859 and¦8861 cattle to Abimelech¦8862 to confirm their¦8864 agreement together,

\v 29 “Why¦8880 did you¦8887 pen those seven¦8883 lambs,” Abimelech¦8877 asked.
\p
\v 30 “Because I want you¦8899 to take¦8896 them,” Abraham insisted. “I want them to be the verification that it was \em me\em* who dug this well.”
\v 31 So that's why the place¦8914 was named ‘Beersheba’ \add (which means ‘Well of the seven’ or ‘Well of the oath’)\add*, because that's where the two¦8921 of them made their¦8921 agreement.

\v 1 \add Several years later,\add* God¦8963 \add decided to\add* test Abraham, calling him, “Abraham.”\x + \xo 22:1-13: \xt Heb 11:17-19.\x*
\p “Here I am,” he replied.
\p
\v 2 “Take your son Yitshak who you love¦8987, your only son,” God commanded him, “and go¦8991 to the Moriah¦8997 region and sacrifice him there¦8999 as a burnt¦9000 offering¦9000 on one of the mountains¦9003 that I'll \add point out\add* to you.”\x + \xo 22:2: \xt 2Ch 3:1.\x*
\p
\v 3 So¦9008 Abraham¦9009 got up early¦9008 in the morning¦9010 and saddled¦9011 his donkey¦9014. Then he took¦9015 two¦9018 of his young¦9019 men¦9019 with him and his son Yitshak, and he cut \add some\add* firewood for the burnt¦9026 offering¦9026. Then they left to go to the place¦9031 that God¦9037 had told him.
\v 4 On the third¦9040 day¦9039 Abraham¦9042 \add looked up ahead\add* and he could see the place¦9049 from a distance¦9050,
\v 5 so he said¦9052 to his young¦9056 men¦9056, “Stay here by yourselves with the donkey¦9063 while the boy¦9065 and I go¦9066 over there to \add worship¦9070 God\add*, then we'll come¦9071 back to you \add here\add*.”
\p
\v 6 So¦9074 Abraham¦9075 took the firewood for the burnt¦9079 offering¦9079 and put it on his son Yitshak¦9083, and he carried the fire¦9089 pot and the knife¦9092. Then¦9074 the two of them went on together¦9095,
\v 7 and Yitshak asked his father Abraham¦9101 his father, “My father?”
\p “Yes, son?”, he replied.
\p “We've got the fire and the wood,”, he continued, “but where's¦9112 the lamb for the burnt¦9114 offering¦9114?”
\p
\v 8 “God¦9118 will provide the lamb for the burnt¦9123 offering¦9123 himself, my son,” Abraham¦9117 answered, and¦9125 then the two of them continued on together¦9127.
\p
\v 9 Then they came¦9129 to the place¦9132 that God¦9137 had told him, and Abraham¦9140 built¦9138 an altar there¦9139 and arranged¦9144 the firewood \add on it\add*. Then he tied up his son Yitshak and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.\x + \xo 22:9: \xt Jam 2:21.\x*
\v 10 Then¦9161 Abraham¦9162 took¦9166 the knife¦9169 and raised his arm to kill his son,
\v 11 but one of Yahweh's¦9178 messengers¦9177 called¦9175 to him from the sky and said, “Abraham! Abraham!”
\p “Here I am.” he answered.
\p
\v 12 “Don't lift up your hand¦9193 against¦9194 the boy¦9196,” \add the messenger\add* continued. “And don't¦9190 do anything¦9201 to him, because now I know¦9206 that you \add respect and obey\add* God¦9210, since you haven't withheld¦9213 your son, your only son, from me.”
\p
\v 13 Then¦9222 Abraham raised his head and looked around, and wow, there was a ram was behind¦9231 him, caught¦9232 by its horns¦9234 in the thicket¦9233. So¦9222 Abraham went¦9235 and grabbed the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt¦9242 offering¦9242 instead of his son.
\v 14 So¦9246 Abraham¦9247 named that place¦9250 ‘Yahweh will provide’, and to this day¦9257 it's still said¦9256, “Yahweh will provide on his mountain¦9258.”
\p
\v 15 Then¦9262 the Yahweh's¦9264 messenger¦9263 called¦9262 Abraham¦9267 from the sky a second¦9268 time
\v 16 saying, “I¦9275, Yahweh¦9278, make this declaration by my \add authority and truth\add* that because¦9280 you did that and didn't withhold¦9288 your only son,\x + \xo 22:16-17: \xt Heb 6:13-14.\x*
\v 17 I'll bless¦9298 you¦9299 tremendously and I'll cause your descendants to be \add as numerous\add* as the stars¦9305 in the sky and as the sand on the beach, and your descendants will be victorious over their¦9317 enemies¦9317.\x + \xo 22:17: \xt Heb 11:12.\x*
\v 18 Because you¦9326 obeyed what I said, all the nations¦9322 of the earth¦9323 will be blessed¦9319 through your¦9320 descendants.”\x + \xo 22:18: \xt Acts 3:25.\x*
\v 19 Then¦9329 Abraham returned¦9329 to his young¦9333 men¦9333 and they all continued on \add home\add* together¦9336 to Beersheba, and Abraham \add continued\add* living \add there\add*.

\p
\v 20 Some time later, Abraham¦9352 heard the news, Look, your brother¦9362 Nahor's¦9361 wife Milcah¦9356 has also given birth¦9355 to sons¦9360:
\v 21 Uz¦9366 his eldest \add son\add*, and Buz¦9370 his brother and Kemuel¦9374, the father¦9375 of Aram¦9376,
\v 22 and Kesed¦9380 and Hazo¦9383 and Pildash¦9386 and Jidlaph¦9389 and Bethuel¦9391.”
\v 23 Those are the eight¦9398 sons that Milcah¦9401 gave birth to for Abraham's¦9404 brother¦9403 Nahor¦9402, and Bethuel¦9393 went on to father¦9394 Rebekah¦9397.
\v 24 \add In addition,\add* Nahor's slave-wife Reumah¦9408 also gave¦9409 birth¦9409 to \add four sons:\add* Tebah¦9415, Gaham¦9418, Tahash¦9421, and Maacah¦9424.

\s1 Sarah's death and burial
\rem /s1 Sarah Dies and Abraham Buys a Burial Ground; The Burial of Sarah; Sarah's Death and Burial; The Death of Sarah
\p
\v 1 Sarah¦9429 went on to be 127 years old
\v 2 when she died¦9440 in \add the city of\add* Kiriat-Arba (now \add called\add* Hebron¦9445) in the Canaan¦9447 region. Abraham¦9449 went¦9448 in \add by her bed\add* to weep and mourn¦9450 for her.
\p
\v 3 \add After a time,\add* Abraham¦9455 got up from beside his dead¦9458 \add wife\add* and he spoke¦9459 to Het's sons, \add requesting\add*,
\v 4 “I'm a foreigner and just staying among you. Give me property for a burial¦9476 place \add on your land\add* so that I can bury¦9478 my dead¦9479 \add wife\add*.”\x + \xo 23:4: \xt Heb 11:9,13; Acts 7:16.\x*
\p
\v 5 Het's¦9485 sons replied to Abraham¦9488, telling him,
\v 6 “My master¦9494, listen to us. You're a mighty prince¦9495 among us. \add Go ahead and\add* bury¦9501 your dead in the choicest¦9499 of our burial places. We've all agreed not to prevent you from burying¦9514 your dead in any of our cemeteries.”
\p
\v 7 Then¦9517 Abraham¦9518 stood and bowed¦9519 to the Het's¦9525 sons¦9523 who were the owners of the land,
\v 8 and \add asked\add* them, “Since¦9537 you're all allowing me to bury¦9536 my dead¦9539, listen¦9541 to me and intercede¦9542 for me with Zohar's¦9548 son Efron¦9545,
\v 9 so that he'll \add sell\add* me Machpelah's¦9556 cave which belongs to him and which is at the end¦9561 of his field¦9562. \add I'll¦9553 pay\add* full price¦9563 if he'll give it to me to use as a burial¦9570 place.”
\p
\v 10 Now Efron¦9579 (the Hittite¦9580) was sitting¦9573 \add there\add* among Het's sons, so he responded to Abraham¦9583 while the other \add land-owners\add* were listening, along with everyone¦9575 else at the city¦9592 gate,
\v 11 “No, my master¦9597. Listen to me: I'll \em give\em* you the field¦9599 and the cave that's in it. I give it to you in front of all these others, then you can bury¦9614 your dead.”
\p
\v 12 Then¦9617 Abraham¦9618 bowed¦9617 before the people¦9620 of the land,
\v 13 and he told Efron¦9626 while all the others were listening, “But¦9623 if you would, please listen¦9637 to me. I'll \add pay\add* the \add value\add* of the field¦9640. Accept it from me, then I'll bury¦9643 my dead¦9646 there¦9647.”
\p
\v 14 Efron¦9650 responded to Abraham¦9651,
\v 15 “My master¦9657, listen¦9658 to me. That land's worth 400 shekels¦9662 of silver¦9664, but that's nothing between¦9665 me and you¦9666. \add Just go ahead\add* and bury¦9673 your¦9672 dead¦9672.”
\v 16 So¦9675 Abraham¦9676 accepted Efron's¦9679 words and weighed¦9680 out for Efron the price that he had mentioned in the hearing¦9688 of Het's sons: 400 shekels¦9694 of silver¦9695 (the currency among the merchants¦9697).
\p
\v 17 So¦9699 Efron's¦9702 field that was in Machpelah¦9704 which faced Mamre¦9707 (including the field and the cave that was in it, and all the trees that were in the field that was within all of its surrounding borders) was deeded
\v 18 to Abraham as the new owner as witnessed by Het's son and everyone¦9727 \add else\add* who had come to the city¦9734 gate.
\v 19 Then¦9736 after¦9736 that, Abraham¦9740 \add laid the body of\add* his wife Sarah¦9743 to rest in the cave in Machpelah's¦9749 field¦9748 facing Mamre¦9753 (also called Hebron¦9755, in the Canaan¦9757 region).
\v 20 So¦9759 the field¦9760 was deeded as property¦9766 to Abraham¦9765 by Het's¦9772 sons, including the cave in it for a burial¦9768 place.

\s1 Yitshak's marriage
\rem /s1 A Wife for Isaac; Isaac and Rebecca; Isaac and Rebekah; The Marriage of Isaac and Rebekah; Isaac Marries Rebekah
\p
\v 1 Abraham¦9775 was now getting very old, and Yahweh had blessed¦9780 him in every¦9784 way.
\v 2 Then¦9786 Abraham¦9787 said¦9786 to his oldest slave¦9790 of his household¦9792 who was in charge¦9793 of everything that belonged to him, “Please put your¦9802 hand¦9802 under¦9803 my thigh¦9804,
\v 3 and I want you to vow by Yahweh, the God of the heavens¦9809 and the God of the earth¦9811, that you won't select a wife¦9816 for my son \add Yitshak\add* from any of the Canaanite¦9819 women in this area where we're living¦9822.
\v 4 Rather¦9836, you¦9832 should go¦9832 \add back\add* to my country¦9828 and to my relatives, and find a wife¦9834 for \add him there\add*.”
\p
\v 5 “Suppose the woman¦9845 isn't willing¦9844 to come \add back\add* with me to this place?” the slave¦9840 asked. “Should I take your son back to the country that you came¦9862 from?”
\p
\v 6 “Make sure that you don't take my son back there¦9876,” Abraham¦9867 answered.
\v 7 “Yahweh¦9878, the God¦9880 of the heavens¦9881, who took¦9883 me from my father's¦9885 house¦9884 and from the land of my relatives, and who spoke¦9889 to me and who promised me, saying, ‘I'll¦9898 give¦9898 this land to your descendants,’ he'll send¦9904 his messenger¦9905 ahead of you, and you'll \add be guaranteed to\add* bring back a wife¦9908 for my son from there¦9910.
\v 8 If¦9923 \add it turned out that\add* the woman¦9916 isn't willing¦9915 to come \add back\add* with you, then you're released from this vow \add to me\add*. \add But¦9912 still in that case,\add* don't¦9914 take¦9927 my son back there¦9928!”
\v 9 Then¦9930 the slave¦9931 put his hand¦9934 under¦9935 the thigh¦9936 of his master¦9938 Abraham¦9932 and promised his \add that he'd follow those instructions.\add*.
\p
\v 10 Then¦9946 the slave¦9947 took¦9946 ten¦9948 of his master's camels¦9949 and \add loaded them with\add* all kinds of good¦9955 things¦9955 from his master, and \add with his own slaves,\add* he travelled to the city¦9966 of Nahor¦9967 in the Aram¦9962 Naharaim¦9963 \add region\add*.
\v 11 Then¦9969 on that first evening¦9978, he made the camels¦9970 kneel¦9969 down outside¦9971 the city¦9972 by the well. It was the time that women come out to fetch water¦9976,
\v 12 and he prayed, “Yahweh¦9985, God¦9986 of my master Abraham, please¦9991 cause it to happen¦9989 right in front of me today that you show kindness toward my master Abraham.
\v 13 See, I'm standing¦10003 by this \add well\add*, and¦10008 the young women from the city¦10010 will be coming¦10011 out \add here\add* to fetch water¦10013.
\v 14 Let it be that if I say to a young woman, ‘Please let me have a drink from your water jar,’ and she says, ‘Sure, and I'll also get more for your camels¦10029,’ let her be the one you have appointed¦10032 for your slave¦10033 Yitshak. And by \add finding\add* her, I'll know that you've shown kindness toward my master¦10043.”
\p
\v 15 Now before he'd even finished¦10049 speaking¦10050, then wow, Rebekah¦10052 arrived with her \add empty\add* water jar on her shoulder¦10067. (She was Bethuel's daughter—Bethuel being the son of Abraham's¦10063 brother¦10062 Nahor¦10061 and his wife¦10060 Milcah¦10059.)
\v 16 The young woman was very beautiful and a virgin¦10073 who hadn't slept with a man¦10074. She went¦10077 down to the well and filled¦10079 her¦10080 jar and came¦10081 \add back\add* up.
\v 17 The slave¦10084 ran¦10083 to meet her¦10085 and¦10086 said¦10086, “Can I have a small¦10089 drink¦10087 of water¦10091 from your¦10092 jar.”
\p
\v 18 “Drink, my master¦10096,” she said¦10094 and quickly¦10097 lowered¦10098 her jar to her hands and gave¦10103 him¦10103 a drink¦10095,
\v 19 and¦10107 after she'd finished giving¦10106 him¦10106 a drink, she said¦10107, “I'll¦10110 also get water¦10110 for your¦10109 camels¦10109 until¦10111 they¦10114 have finished drinking¦10115.”
\v 20 Then¦10117 she hurried and emptied¦10118 her¦10119 jar into the trough¦10122 and ran back to the well to draw \add more\add* water, and she drew \add enough\add* water for all his camels¦10132
\v 21 \add while Abraham's slave\add* watched her silently¦10137 to determine whether¦10139 Yahweh¦10140 had made his journey successful¦10139 or not.
\p
\v 22 Then¦10146 when the camels¦10149 had finished¦10148 drinking¦10150, the slave took out an \add expensive\add* gold nose ring and two \add solid\add* gold bracelets¦10158 for her¦10161 arms.
\v 23 “Tell me, whose daughter¦10167 are you?” he asked her. “Is there¦10174 room at your father's¦10177 house¦10175 for us to stay?”
\p
\v 24 “I'm Bethuel's¦10186 daughter¦10184. He's the son of Nahor¦10193 and Milcah¦10190,” she¦10192 answered.
\v 25 “We've got plenty of both straw¦10199 and fodder¦10202 \add for the camels\add*, and there's also a room where you could stay.”
\p
\v 26 Then¦10210 the \add slave\add* bowed¦10210 down and¦10212 worshipped¦10212 Yahweh¦10213
\v 27 and said, “Praised be Yahweh, my master Abraham's¦10220 God¦10218, who hasn't relented from his kindness¦10225 and faithfulness¦10226 toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me on the road to the home of my master's relatives¦10234.”
\p
\v 28 Then¦10237 the young woman ran¦10237 \add home\add* and¦10239 told her¦10241 mother's¦10241 household¦10240 what had happened.
\v 29 Now Rebekah¦10245 had a brother¦10246 named Lavan (Laban¦10248), and¦10247 he ran¦10249 out to the man¦10253 at the well.
\v 30 He had seen the nose ring and the bracelets¦10267 on his sister's arms, and when he'd heard¦10272 his sister Rebekah's¦10276 words¦10275 saying, “This is what the man said to me,” then he went to the man, and indeed, he was \add there\add* standing¦10289 by the camels¦10292 at the spring¦10295
\v 31 and he \add invited him\add*, “Come, you who're blessed¦10299 by Yahweh¦10300. Why are you standing¦10302 out here? I've \add already\add* prepared the house¦10306 and a place¦10307 for the camels¦10308.”
\p
\v 32 So¦10310 \add Abraham's slave\add* went¦10310 to the house¦10312. Then¦10310 he unloaded¦10313 the camels and gave them straw¦10316 and fodder¦10317, and water¦10319 to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.\f + \fr 24:32 \ft It's not certain from the pronouns in the text here, just who did what in this second sentence—whether it was the slave (the guest) or Lavan (the host), so other translations might vary.\f*
\v 33 Then¦10327 food was set out for \add them\add* to eat, but \add Abraham's slave\add* said, “I won't eat until¦10334 I have \add said what I have to say\add*.”
\p “Speak then,” Lavan responded¦10331.
\p
\v 34 “I'm¦10345 one of Abraham's¦10344 slaves¦10343,” he said¦10342,
\v 35 and Yahweh has blessed¦10348 my master¦10351 a lot, so that he has become¦10353 wealthy¦10353. \add Yahweh\add* has given¦10354 him cattle, sheep¦10357 and goats, silver¦10359 and gold¦10360, male and female¦10362 slaves, and camels¦10363 and donkeys¦10364.
\v 36 And¦10378 my master's wife Sarah¦10367 gave¦10374 birth¦10366 to a son for my master \add despite\add* her¦10373 old age, and \add my master\add* has given¦10374 him everything that he owns.
\v 37 My master¦10387 made promises, saying, ‘You mustn't get a wife¦10392 for my son from Canaanite¦10395 women whose land I am living¦10398 in,
\v 38 but rather you¦10409 must go¦10409 to my father's¦10408 house¦10406 and to my clan, and find a wife¦10414 for my son \add there\add*.’
\v 39 Then¦10417 I \add asked\add* my master¦10420, ‘Suppose the woman¦10425 \add refuses\add* to come with me?’
\v 40 And he \add ≈replied\add*, ‘\add The God\add* Yahweh¦10430 that I obey, he'll send¦10435 his messenger¦10436 with you and make your¦10439 journey¦10439 succeed¦10438, so that you'll find a wife¦10441 for my son from my clan, and from my father's¦10445 house¦10444.
\v 41 Then you'll be free of your promise: When you go¦10451 to my clan, and if they won't allow her to \add return with\add* you, then you'll be clear from \add this promise\add*.’
\p
\v 42 “Then¦10464 today I came¦10464 to the well, and¦10469 I said¦10469, ‘Yahweh¦10470, God¦10471 of my master¦10472 Abraham¦10473, if it's what you¦10476 want, make my journey¦10480 succeed¦10479 that I have come on.
\v 43 Listen, I'm standing¦10488 by this well, so let it be that the young¦10494 woman¦10494 who comes¦10495 out to fetch water and I say to her, “Please give me a little¦10502 water to drink from your jar,”
\v 44 and she¦10516 replies to me, “Sure, drink¦10512, and I will also get water¦10515 for your¦10514 camels¦10514,” let her be the wife that Yahweh¦10521 has chosen for the my master's¦10524 son.’
\v 45 Before I'd finished¦10528 speaking¦10529 in my heart¦10532, then wow, Rebekah¦10534 was coming¦10535 out with her jar on her shoulder¦10539. And she went¦10540 down to the well and drew water¦10542, and I asked her, ‘Can I have a drink¦10545.’
\v 46 So she hurried and lowered¦10549 her jar from her \add shoulder\add* and said, ‘Drink, and I'll also water your camels.’ So I drank¦10558 and she also watered the camels.
\v 47 Then I asked¦10563 her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel¦10573, a son of Nahor¦10576 and his wife Milcah¦10581.’ Then I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets¦10587 on her arms.
\v 48 Then¦10592 I¦10594 bowed¦10592 down and worshipped¦10593 and praised my master Abraham's¦10601 God¦10599 Yahweh¦10598, who led me on the right way to \add find\add* the daughter¦10609 of my master's brother¦10611 for his son.
\v 49 And now if you¦10618 all want to show kindness and¦10627 faithfulness to my master¦10624, tell me. But¦10615 if not, tell me, so that I \add can decide what to do next\add*.”
\p
\v 50 Then¦10641 Lavan¦10642 and¦10644 Bethuel¦10643 answered¦10641, “This matter¦10647 has come¦10646 from Yahweh, \add so\add* we're not able to tell you¦10651 bad or good¦10655.
\v 51 \add But\add* listen, Rebekah's¦10659 \add right here\add*. Take her and go¦10662, and let her become the wife¦10664 of your master's¦10667 son, as Yahweh¦10670 has \add indicated\add*.”
\v 52 \add Now\add* when Abraham's¦10676 slave¦10675 heard¦10674 their¦10679 \add reply\add*, he bowed¦10680 down to the ground before Yahweh¦10682.
\v 53 Then¦10684 \add he\add* brought¦10684 out silver¦10688 and gold¦10690 jewelry, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah¦10693. And he gave valuable things to her brother¦10696 and her mother¦10697.
\p
\v 54 Then \add Abraham's slave\add* and the men¦10702 with him ate¦10699 and drank¦10700 and stayed \add there overnight\add*. Then in the morning¦10708 they got up, and he said¦10709, “\add Let\add* me \add leave now and return back\add* to my master¦10711.”
\p
\v 55 But¦10713 \add Rebekah's\add* brother¦10714 and¦10715 her¦10714 mother¦10715 said¦10713, “Let the girl¦10717 stay with us a few days¦10719, at least ten¦10721. After \add that\add* she¦10723 can go¦10723.”
\p
\v 56 “Don't detain me,” he¦10732 told them, “since Yahweh¦10736 has made my journey¦10733 successful¦10732. Send me off so that I \add can return\add* to my master¦10736.”
\p
\v 57 “Let's¦10742 call for the young woman and¦10741 \add find out what she wants to do\add*.” they¦10738 responded¦10738.

\p “\add Yes,\add* I'll go.” she answered.
\p
\v 59 \add So¦10758\add* they \add got ready to\add* send off their¦10762 sister¦10762 Rebekah¦10761 with Abraham's¦10769 slave¦10768 and his men¦10772, along with her¦10765 \add childhood\add* nurse¦10765.

\p
\v 1 Then there was a famine in the region (a different one from the earlier famine that was in the days¦11397 of Abraham¦11398) so Yitshak \add moved\add* to Gerar¦11408, \add the region of\add* Abimelech¦11403, the Philistines¦11407 king¦11405.

\v 3 Stay as a guest in this region, and I'll be with you and bless¦11429 you, because I'll give¦11434 all this land to you and to your descendants¦11433, and I'll confirm the oath that I made to your father Abraham¦11447.\x + \xo 26:3-4: \xt Gen 22:16-18.\x*

\v 5 because Abraham¦11473 obeyed me by keeping my requirements, my commands¦11477, my decrees, and my laws.”
\p
\v 6 So¦11481 Yitshak¦11482 settled \add there\add* in Gerar¦11483.
\v 7 Then¦11485 the men of the place asked¦11485 about¦11488 his wife, and he said, “She's my sister¦11490,” because he was afraid¦11493 to say, “She's my wife.” He was thinking, “What if the men in this place kill me because Rebekah¦11503 is so beautiful to look at.”\x + \xo 26:7: \xt Gen 12:13; 20:2.\x*
\v 8 Then¦11510 when he'd been in that area for quite a while, the Philistine¦11520 King Abimelech¦11518 looked¦11517 down from a window¦11522 and saw¦11523 that \add to his surprise\add*, Yitshak was laughing \add together\add* with his wife Rebekah¦11528.
\v 9 So Abimelech¦11532 called¦11531 for Yitshak and said, “Hey, she's really your wife¦11537! So how could you say, ‘She's my sister¦11541’?”
\p “Because I said \add to myself\add*, ‘I might die¦11550 because of her¦11551.’,” Yitshak replied.
\p
\v 10 “What's this that you've done to us?” continued Abimelech¦11554. “One of \add my\add* people¦11563 might¦11560 easily have slept with your wife and¦11567 you would have brought¦11567 condemnation onto us!”

\p
\v 12 Then¦11586 Yitshak¦11587 \add planted a crop\add* in that land and Yahweh¦11596 blessed¦11595 him and gave him one hundred¦11593 times as much as he'd planted.

\v 15 they blocked up all the wells¦11625 that his father's slaves¦11628 had dug when his father Abraham¦11634 had been alive, and they filled them with dirt.

\v 17 So¦11652 Yitshak left that place and set up camp in the Gerar¦11658 Valley and settled there.
\v 18 Then¦11662 he returned and dug out the water¦11669 wells¦11668 that they had dug in the days¦11672 of Abraham his father and that the Philistines¦11676 had blocked up after¦11677 Abraham's¦11673 death¦11678, and he called them similar names¦11682 to the ones that his father had called them.
\p
\v 19 Then¦11690 Yitshak's¦11693 slaves¦11691 dug in the valley¦11694 and¦11695 found¦11695 an \add underground\add* spring with flowing water¦11699 there¦11697.
\v 20 But¦11702 the herdsmen from Gerar¦11704 quarrelled¦11718 with Yitshak's herdsmen, saying, “The water¦11711 belongs to us.” So¦11702 he named the well ‘Esek’ \add (which means ‘dispute’)\add*, because they disputed with him.
\p
\v 21 \add Yitshak's men\add* dug another¦11723 well, but they quarrelled¦11724 over it too, so he named it ‘Sitnah¦11730’ \add (which means ‘opposition’)\add*.
\v 22 Then¦11732 he moved¦11732 from there¦11733 and dug another¦11736 well, and they didn't quarrel over it, so he named it ‘Rehoboth¦11742’ \add (which means ‘space’)\add*, and he said¦11743, “Because now Yahweh¦11748 has made space for us and we'll be productive in this area.”
\p
\v 23 Then¦11753 from there¦11754 Yitshak moved \add down\add* to Beer¦11755-Sheba¦11756,
\v 24 and Yahweh¦11760 appeared¦11758 to him during that night¦11761 and said¦11763, “I am the God¦11765 of your father Abraham. Don't be afraid¦11770, because I'm with you and I will bless¦11775 you and multiply¦11776 your descendants for the sake of my slave¦11782 Abraham.”
\v 25 So¦11784 Yitshak built¦11784 an altar¦11786 there and he prayed to Yahweh¦11789. He set up his tents there and his slaves¦11797 dug a well there.

\v 28 “We have clearly¦11826 seen that Yahweh¦11831 has been with you,” they \add ≈answered\add*, “so we said, ‘There should¦11835 be an agreement between us’—between us and you. So¦11825 let us make an agreement with you,

\v 19 “I'm your oldest son Esaw¦12212,” Yacob\add ≈replied\add* to his father¦12210. “I've done what you told me. Please get up, \add and come and\add* sit¦12221 up and eat¦12222 some of my game, so that you'll bless¦12225 me.”
\v 20 “How did you find it so quickly, my son?” Yitshak \add asked\add*.
\p “Because your God¦12243 Yahweh¦12242 \add helped me when I went out hunting\add*,” Yacob \add ≈answered\add*.
\p
\v 21 Then¦12246 Yitshak said¦12246 to Yacob¦12250, “Please come¦12251 close so that I can touch you, my son, and \add to be sure\add* whether¦12256 you're really my son Esaw¦12259 or not.”
\v 22 So¦12264 Yacob went close to his father¦12269 and \add Yitshak\add* felt \add his skin\add* and said \add to himself\add*, “It's Yacob's¦12265 voice, but \add these\add* are \add definitely\add* Esaw's hands.”
\v 23 So¦12279 he didn't recognise¦12280 \add that it was Yacob\add*, because his hands were hairy¦12288 like Esaw's hands, so he was about to bless¦12289 him
\v 24 \add but asked once more,\add* “Are you¦12292 really my son Esaw¦12295?”
\p “\add Yes,\add* I am,” Yacob answered.
\p
\v 25 \add So Yitshak told him\add*, “Bring the food \add here\add* and I'll eat some of my son's¦12304 game, so that my \add I can then\add* bless¦12306 you.” \add So Yacob\add* took it to him and he ate, and then he brought wine to him and he drank¦12315.
\v 26 Then¦12317 Yitshak asked \add Yacob\add*, “My son, please¦12323 come¦12321 close and¦12324 kiss¦12324 me.”
\v 27 So¦12329 he went¦12329 close and kissed¦12330 him. \add His dad noticed\add* the smell of his clothes, so he blessed him saying,\x + \xo 27:27-29: \xt Heb 11:20.\x*
\q1 “\add Ah yes,\add* the smell of my son

\p
\v 30 Then¦12381 just as Yitshak had finished¦12383 blessing¦12385 Yacob, and as Yacob had only just gone out from his father's¦12397 presence, his brother Esaw¦12398 his brother \add returned\add* from his hunting¦12401.
\v 31 Then¦12403 he too prepared \add some\add* tasty food and brought¦12408 it \add in\add* to his father and said, “Let my father get up and eat from the game that his son \add hunted\add* so that you can bless¦12418 me.”

\v 32 But¦12421 Yitshak asked him, “Which son \add are\add* you¦12427?”
\p “I'm your oldest son Esaw¦12432.” he \add ≈answered\add*.
\p
\v 33 Then Yitshak \add started to\add* trembled¦12434 \add badly\add* and he said¦12441, “Then who was it that hunted game and brought¦12449 it to me? I ate¦12451 it all just before¦12453 you came¦12454 \add in\add*, and I blessed \add that man\add* and indeed, he'll be blessed.”
\p
\v 34 When Esaw¦12462 heard¦12461 \add that\add*, then he let out a very loud and exceedingly bitter¦12470 wail, and \add then begged\add* his father, “Bless me too, my father.”
\p
\v 35 But¦12482 Yitshak replied, “Your brother¦12484 came¦12483 \add in and deceived¦12485 me\add* and he's taken your¦12487 blessing¦12487!”

\v 36 “\add Yes,\add* his name¦12492 Yacob¦12493 \add (meaning ‘deceiver¦12494’) suits him exactly!\add*”\x + \xo 27:36: \xt Gen 25:29-34.\x* said Esaw. “\add First\add* he took my inheritance and man, now he's also taken¦12503 my blessing!” Then¦12489 he \add asked\add*, “Haven't you \add at least\add* saved a blessing for me?”
\p
\v 37 But¦12512 Yitshak replied, “Listen, I've made him master¦12517 over you, and I've given¦12525 all his brothers to him as slaves¦12527. And I've sustained¦12530 him with grain¦12528 and wine. So¦12512 then, what \add else\add* can I do for you, my son?”
\p
\v 38 “Did you \add only\add* have \em one\em* blessing¦12542 that you \add could give\add*, my father? Esaw \add asked\add*. “Bless me too, my father!” Then¦12537 Esaw sobbed loudly.\x + \xo 27:38: \xt Heb 12:17.\x*

\v 41 \add From that time onwards,\add* Esaw hated Yacob because of the blessing that \add their\add* father had blessed him with, and Esaw said \add to himself\add*, “My father's \add funeral\add* can't be that far away—\add after that\add* I'll kill my brother¦12610 Yacob.”

\c 28
\p
\v 1 So¦12708 Yitshak called¦12708 for Yacob¦12712 and blessed¦12713 him, and instructed¦12715 him, “Don't take¦12720 a wife¦12721 from the Caananite girls.

\v 5 Then¦12774 Yitshak sent¦12774 Yacob \add away\add*, and he went¦12779 to Paddan¦12780 Aram¦12781—to Lavan¦12784, the son of Bethuel¦12787 the Aramean¦12788 and the brother¦12789 of Yacob and Esaw's mother¦12791 Rebekah¦12790.

\p
\v 6 Now Esaw¦12796 noticed that Yitshak had blessed Yacob¦12803 and sent him to Paddan¦12806 Aram¦12807 to take a wife for himself from there¦12811. \add He'd also noticed\add* that when \add Yitshak\add* had blessed him, he'd instructed¦12815 him not to take a wife from the Canaanite girls,

\v 8 \add As a result,\add* Esaw¦12838 \add realised\add* that his father¦12845 wasn't happy about the Canaanite girls

\v 10 \add Meanwhile,\add* Yacob¦12873 had left Beersheba and was enroute to Haran¦12877.
\v 11 \add One¦12883 night¦12881\add* after he'd stopped when the sun had gone down, he laid down in that place and used one of the stones¦12888 there¦12882 to put under¦12891 his head \add for a pillow\add*.
\v 12 \add While he was sleeping,\add* he had a dream¦12896, and wow, a stairway¦12898 was set up on the earth and its top reached¦12902 to the heavens¦12903, and look, God's messengers¦12905 were ascending and descending¦12908 on it.\x + \xo 28:12: \xt Yhn 1:51.\x*
\v 13 And look, Yahweh was standing¦12913 above it and he said¦12915, “I am Yahweh, the God of Abraham¦12919 your grandfather and the God of Yitshak. I will give¦12929 the land that you are lying¦12926 on to you and to your descendants¦12930\x + \xo 28:13: \xt Gen 13:14-15.\x*

\v 15 \add So¦12949\add* listen, I'm with you and I'll watch over you everywhere you go¦12956. I'll bring¦12957 you back to this land because I won't leave¦12964 you until¦12965 I've done what I told you.”
\p
\v 16 Then¦12976 Yacob¦12977 woke up and said¦12979 \add to himself\add*, “Yahweh¦12982 is certainly \add here\add* in this place¦12983, but I didn't realise¦12987 it.”

\p
\v 18 Then¦13007 in the morning¦13009 Yacob¦13008 got up early¦13007, and he took¦13010 the stone¦13013 that he'd put under¦13017 his head and stood it up \add longways\add* as a pillar¦13020, and he poured¦13021 oil over the top of it.

\v 2 \add Close¦13118 to his destination,\add* he looked \add ahead\add*, and wow, there was a well in the field¦13108, and what's more, three¦13112 flocks of sheep¦13115 and goats were lying¦13116 there near it, because the flocks were watered¦13123 from that well \add but\add* the stone¦13125 over the mouth¦13129 of the well was large¦13126 \add and heavy\add*.

\p
\v 4 \add So¦13159\add* Yacob¦13161 \add asked the farmers\add*, “My brothers¦13162, where¦13163 are you¦13164 from?”
\p “We're from Haran¦13166,” they¦13165 \add ≈replied\add*.
\p
\v 5 “Do you know Nahor's¦13177 grandson Lavan?” Yacob asked.
\p “\add Yes,\add* we know him,” they \add ≈replied\add*.
\p
\v 6 “Is he doing well?” Yacob asked.
\p “\add Yes,\add* he's fine,” they said, “and here comes his daughter¦13189 Rahel with \add their\add* flock.”
\p
\v 7 “Look, it's still¦13197 \add broad daylight\add*,” Yacob told them. “It's not time¦13202 for the livestock¦13204 to be brought it. Water the flock, and¦13207 go¦13207 pasture¦13208 them.”
\p
\v 8 “We¦13220 can't,” they said¦13210, “until¦13213 \em all\em* the flocks¦13218 are gathered¦13215 \add here\add* and they roll the stone¦13222 off the \add top\add* of the well. Then¦13210 we¦13212 will water¦13226 the sheep¦13227.”
\p
\v 9 He was still talking¦13230 with them when Rahel came¦13234 with her¦13239 father's¦13239 flock, because she was \add the one who looked after\add* them.
\v 10 When Yacob¦13247 saw Rahel (the daughter¦13251 of his mother's brother, Lavan) with Lavan's flock, \add he\add* went over and rolled¦13264 the stone¦13267 \add off the top\add* of the well and watered¦13271 the sheep and goats.

\p
\v 16 Now Lavan had two¦13363 daughters¦13364: the older one was named Le'ah, and¦13368 the younger¦13369 one was named Rahel (Rachel¦13370).
\v 17 Le'ah had \add pretty\add* eyes¦13372, but Rahel was \add extremely beautiful in every way\add*.

\v 18 \add Now\add* Yacob¦13384 \add was in love with\add* Rahel, so he \add ≈answered\add*, “I'll \add work for\add* you¦13389 \add for\add* seven¦13390 years¦13391 \add so I can marry\add* your¦13393 younger¦13394 daughter¦13393 Rahel.”
\p
\v 19 “\add Okay,\add* stay with me \add then\add*,” said Lavan. “It's better for me to give her to you than to give her to some other man¦13405.”
\p
\v 20 So¦13410 Yacob¦13411 \add worked\add* seven¦13413 years¦13414 for Rahel¦13412, but \add it only seemed\add* like a few days¦13417 \add to him¦13416\add* because of his¦13416 love¦13419 for her,

\v 22 \add So¦13437\add* Lavan¦13438 invited all the local people¦13443 and¦13445 held a wedding reception,

\v 25 \add But¦13472\add* in the morning¦13473, \add Yacob saw\add* that wow, it was Leah¦13477! “\add Hey,\add* what's this \add that\add* you've done to me?” Yacob \add demanded of\add* Lavan. “Wasn't it Rahel that I \add worked for\add* you for? So¦13472 why did you deceive¦13492 me?”
\p
\v 26 “It's not our¦13500 custom here,” Lavan answered, “for the younger¦13502 \add daughter\add* to marry before the older one.
\v 27 Stay¦13513 with \add just\add* this one for the \add marriage\add* week¦13507, and¦13509 \add then\add* we'll also give¦13509 you¦13518 the \add younger\add* one \add in return for\add* another¦13524 seven¦13521 year's work.”
\p
\v 28 \add So¦13526\add* Yacob¦13527 agreed and \add spent the week¦13530 with Le'ah\add*, then \add Lavan also\add* gave¦13532 him his daughter¦13538 Rahel to be his wife.

\v 31 \add Now\add* Yahweh¦13574 saw¦13573 that Le'ah was spurned, so he \add allowed her¦13582 to conceive\add*, but Rahel was \add unable to get pregnant\add*.

\v 1 Now Rahel \add realised\add* that she wasn't \add producing any\add* children for Yacob, so she envied¦13679 her¦13681 sister¦13681 \add Le'ah\add*, and she \add demanded from\add* Yacob, “Give me children, and if \add you don't¦13676\add*, I'll die!”
\p
\v 2 \add But¦13696\add* Yacob's¦13699 anger¦13698 \add flared up\add* against Rahel and he \add asked\add*, “Am I in the place¦13702 of God¦13703 who's kept you \add from getting pregnant\add*?”
\p
\v 3 \add Rahel answered\add*, “Listen, \add here's\add* my slave Bilhah¦13716. \add Sleep with\add* her so that she'll \add have children¦13723 on my behalf\add* and I'll also \add be able to have a family through¦13727\add* her.”
\v 4 Then¦13729 she gave¦13729 Bilhah¦13734 to him as a \add slave\add* wife and¦13737 Yacob¦13739 \add slept with\add* her¦13735,
\v 5 \add so\add* then Bilhah¦13742 \add got pregnant¦13741\add* and¦13743 \add produced\add* a son for Yacob¦13744.
\v 6 Rahel said¦13747, “God¦13750 has vindicated¦13749 me, and indeed he's listened¦13752 to my \add request\add* and given¦13754 me a son!” That's why she named him ‘Dan¦13763’ \add (which means ‘he judged (in my favour)’)\add*.
\v 7 \add Later on,\add* Rahel's slave Bilhah¦13768 \add got pregnant¦13765\add* again¦13766 and¦13767 \add gave¦13767 birth¦13767 to\add* a second¦13772 son for Yacob¦13773
\v 8 \add so\add* Rahel said¦13775, “I've \add had a difficult battle\add* with my sister¦13783 but I've \add succeeded\add* in the end!” \add So¦13775\add* she named \add the baby\add* ‘Naftali¦13789’ \add (which means ‘my struggle’)\add*.
\p
\v 9 \add Now when\add* Le'ah \add noticed\add* that she \add wasn't getting pregnant any more\add*, she gave¦13801 her¦13800 female slave Zilpah¦13799 to Yacob¦13803 as a \add slave\add* wife.
\v 10 Then¦13806 \add eventually\add* Le'ah's¦13809 slave Zilpah¦13807 \add produced\add* a son for Yacob¦13810,
\v 11 and¦13817 Le'ah said¦13813, “What good fortune!” So¦13813 she named him ‘Gad¦13821’ \add (which means ‘fortunate’)\add*.
\v 12 Then¦13823 Le'ah's¦13826 slave Zilpah¦13824 \add produced\add* a second¦13828 son for Yacob¦13829,
\v 13 and¦13837 Le'ah said¦13831, “How blessed I am because women will call me blessed.” So¦13831 she named him ‘Asher¦13841’ \add (which means ‘blessed’)\add*.
\p
\v 14 \add One day during\add* the wheat¦13848 harvest¦13846, Reuben¦13844 went¦13843 out and found¦13849 \add some\add* mandrake \add plants\add*\f + \fr 30:14 \ft The mandrake plants were believed to increase fertility, but it's not clear from the text which part of the plant was used or how they were applied.\f* in the field¦13851 and brought¦13852 them \add home\add* to Le'ah his mother¦13857. Then¦13843 Rahel \add asked\add* Le'ah, “Please give¦13863 me some of your¦13868 son's¦13868 mandrakes.”
\p
\v 15 “Is it a small¦13872 matter you have taken¦13873 my husband¦13876?” Le'ah \add snapped back\add*. “And would you also take¦13877 my son's mandrakes?”
\p “\add Well,\add* he can \add sleep\add* with you tonight \add in exchange\add* for your son's mandrakes.” Rahel \add ≈answered\add*.
\v 16 \add So that\add* evening¦13898 \add when\add* Yacob¦13894 came¦13893 \add home\add* from the field¦13897, Leah¦13900 went¦13899 out to meet him and told \add him\add*, “You must come¦13904 to me \add tonight\add* because I've hired¦13907 you with my son's¦13909 mandrakes¦13908.” So he \add slept¦13910\add* with her that night¦13912.
\p
\v 17 God¦13916 listened¦13915 to Le'ah¦13919 and she \add got pregnant¦13920\add* and \add produced\add* a fifth¦13924 son for Yacob¦13922,
\v 18 saying, “God¦13929 has given¦13928 me my reward because I gave¦13933 my slave to my husband¦13935 \add to sleep with\add*.” So¦13926 she named him ‘Yissashkar’ \add (which means ‘reward’)\add*.
\v 19 Then¦13940 Le'ah¦13942 \add got pregnant¦13940\add* again¦13941 and¦13943 \add produced\add* a sixth¦13946 son for Yacob¦13947,
\v 20 saying, “God¦13953 has \add given\add* me a nice present. This time¦13958 my husband¦13960 will honour me because I have \add produced\add* six¦13965 sons¦13966 for him.” So she called¦13967 his name¦13970 ‘Zebulun¦13971’ \add (which might mean ‘honour’)\add*.
\v 21 Later on, Le'ah had a daughter¦13975 and¦13976 named her Dinah¦13980.
\p
\v 22 Then¦13982 God¦13983 \add paid attention\add* to Rahel¦13986 and listened¦13987 to her and \add enabled her to conceive\add*,
\v 23 \add so\add* she \add got pregnant¦13995\add* and produced a son, and said¦13998, “God¦14001 has taken away my disgrace¦14003.”
\v 24 She named him ‘Yosef¦14009’ \add (which means ‘may he¦14011 give another’)\add*, saying, “May Yahweh¦14012 add another son to me.”

\p
\v 25 \add Sometime\add* after Rahel had given birth to Yosef¦14023, Yacob¦14025 said¦14024 to Lavan, “Send me off \add now\add*, so that I can \add return\add* to my place and to my land.
\v 26 \add Let me take\add* my wives¦14039 that I worked for you for, and take my children¦14042 so that I can leave, because you yourself know¦14050 \add how long and hard I've worked for\add* you.”
\p
\v 27 \add But¦14057\add* Lavan \add ≈replied\add*, “Please stay, if I've found¦14063 favour¦14064 in your¦14069 eyes¦14065 \add because\add* I've learned¦14066 by divination¦14066 that Yahweh¦14068 has blessed¦14067 me because of you.”
\v 28 Then¦14071 he \add added\add*, “Tell me how much you \add want\add* and¦14075 I'll pay you that.”
\p
\v 29 “You yourself know¦14080 how \add well\add* I've served¦14083 you and how your livestock¦14088 have \add prospered\add* with me.” Yacob \add ≈replied\add*.
\v 30 \add Before I came, you didn't have much, but now you have plenty because\add* Yahweh¦14101 has blessed¦14100 you \add wherever I was involved\add*. But now, when will I also do something for my \add own\add* household¦14110?”
\p
\v 31 “What should I give you?” Lavan \add asked\add*.
\p “You don't¦14119 have to \em give\em* me anything¦14124,” Yacob¦14118 \add ≈replied\add*. “If you'll do this \add one\add* thing¦14130 for me, I'll continue \add taking care of\add* your flocks¦14134:
\v 32 Let me look through all your¦14140 flocks¦14140 today and separate out from them all the lambs¦14155 that are speckled, spotted, or dark-coloured, and all the young goats¦14158 that are spotted or speckled. They will be my pay.
\v 33 \add So¦14162\add* in the future¦14167, you'll be able to see that I've been honest¦14165 because you'll be able to see it for yourself: any goat that's not speckled¦14179 and spotted¦14180, and any sheep that's not dark-coloured, if it's in my flock then it must have been stolen¦14184.”
\p
\v 34 “Okay then, let's \add do it your¦14193 way\add*.” Lavan \add agreed\add*.
\v 35 \add But¦14195\add* that \add very\add* day¦14196, he removed¦14195 the male goats that were streaked¦14201 and spotted, and all the female¦14206 goats that were speckled¦14207 and spotted, any that had white¦14212 on it, and all the dark-coloured ones among the lambs¦14217. Then¦14195 he gave them to his sons \add to look after\add*,
\v 36 and \add they took them\add* a three-day¦14225 journey¦14224 \add away from where\add* Yacob \add was\add*, \add so\add* Yacob was \add left just\add* tending \em the rest\em* of Lavan's flocks¦14234.
\p
\v 37 Then¦14238 Yacob¦14241 \add got some\add* freshly¦14244 cut branches of poplar¦14243 and almond¦14245 and plane¦14246 trees¦14246, and peeled¦14248 white stripes¦14250 in them \add by\add* exposing the white that was inside the branches.
\v 38 Then¦14260 he put the branches¦14262 that he had peeled in the water¦14267 troughs¦14265 where the flocks \add would see them when they\add* came to drink, and they mated when they came to drink.
\v 39 \add Thus\add* the flocks would mate by the \add striped¦14285\add* branches¦14282, and \add they\add* would bear young who were streaked, speckled¦14286, and spotted¦14287.
\p
\v 40 Then¦14289 Yacob¦14291 \add separated out those young animals into a separate flock\add*, and he made the \add older\add* flocks look at the streaked and all the dark-coloured animals in Lavan's flocks. \add So¦14289\add* he kept his own flocks by themselves and didn't \add mix\add* them with Lavan's flocks.
\p
\v 41 So¦14315 whenever the strong¦14320 animals were \add ready to mate\add*, then Yacob¦14322 put the branches in the troughs¦14328 \add in front\add* of the flocks so that they would mate by the branches,
\v 42 \add but\add* when the animals were weak, he didn't put them in. So¦14332 the weak animals went to Lavan¦14338 and the strong¦14339 ones to Yacob¦14340
\v 43 so he \add became¦14342 very wealthy¦14342\add*, and he owned large flocks \add as well as\add* male and female¦14351 slaves, and camels¦14353 and donkeys¦14354.

\s1 Yacob flees from Lavan
\rem /s1 Jacob Flees from Laban; Jacob Flees with Family and Flocks
\p
\v 1 \add One day, Yacob\add* overheard the words¦14359 of Lavan's sons who were saying, “Yacob has taken¦14364 everything that belonged to our father, and from what \add originally\add* belonged to our father he has gained all this wealth¦14377.”
\v 2 Then¦14380 Yacob¦14381 \add also noticed\add* that Lavan's¦14385 \add attitude towards him had changed\add*, and¦14386 he wasn't \add in favour of him like he'd been in the past\add*.
\v 3 Then¦14392 Yahweh¦14393 \add ≈told\add* Yacob¦14396, “Go back to the land of your ancestors¦14401 and to your relatives, and I'll be with you¦14404.”
\p
\v 4 \add So¦14406\add* Yacob¦14407 sent¦14406 for Rahel and Le'ah to \add come to him out in\add* the field¦14411 \add where he was with\add* his flocks¦14414
\v 5 and he told them, “I've¦14419 \add noticed\add* your father's \add attitude\add* and that he's not \add positive\add* toward me \add like he was a few days¦14429\add* ago, but my father's God¦14430 has been with me.
\v 6 You \add both\add* know¦14436 that I've served¦14441 your¦14444 father¦14444 with all my strength¦14440,
\v 7 \add but\add* your¦14446 father¦14446 has deceived¦14447 me and changed¦14449 my wages¦14452 ten¦14453 times¦14454. However¦14450, God¦14458 hasn't allowed¦14457 him¦14457 to harm me.
\v 8 \add When he told me\add*: ‘The speckled animals will be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore speckled young. But when he \add ≈told me\add*: ‘The streaked ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore streaked young.
\v 9 \add In¦14489 that way,\add* God¦14488 took your¦14492 father's¦14492 animals away from him and¦14493 gave¦14493 them to me.
\p
\v 10 “\add One day during\add* the season when the flocks were \add mating¦14507\add*, I \add looked up\add* and saw¦14503 in a dream¦14504 that, wow, the male¦14506 goats¦14506 that were mounting the flocks were streaked, speckled¦14512, and spotted.
\v 11 Then¦14515 God's messenger¦14517 said to me in the dream¦14519, ‘Yacob¦14520!’ and I said, ‘\add I'm listening\add*.’
\v 12 Then¦14524 he \add ≈told me\add*, ‘Please \add look up\add* and \add observe that\add* all the male¦14532 goats¦14532 that are mounting the flocks¦14536 are streaked, speckled¦14538, and spotted, because I have seen¦14541 everything that Lavan is doing¦14547 to you.
\v 13 I'm the God¦14551 of Beyt-El, where you anointed¦14556 a pillar¦14558—where you vowed¦14560 a vow to me. Now \add pack\add* up and depart from this land, and return¦14571 to the land where you were born.’ ”\x + \xo 31:13: \xt Gen 28:18-22.\x*
\p
\v 14 Then¦14577 Rahel and Le'ah replied, “\add Yes,\add* we're not expecting any portion or inheritance¦14585 from our¦14587 father's¦14587 \add property\add*.
\v 15 Doesn't he just \add treat\add* us like foreigners¦14590 \add now\add*? \add Yes,\add* he sold us and¦14595 then he \add frittered away all the money¦14601 that should have been\add* ours,
\v 16 so all the wealth¦14606 that God took from our father¦14610 \add belonged\add* to us and to our children¦14613 \add anyway\add*. So \add yes\add*, \add go ahead and\add* do everything that God's told you¦14619 \add to do\add*.”
\p
\v 17 So¦14622 Yacob¦14623 \add packed\add* up and put his wives¦14630 and children¦14627 on the camels¦14633.
\v 18 Then¦14635 he drove¦14635 all his livestock and all his property¦14645 that he had acquired—the livestock in his possession¦14649 that he had acquired in Paddan¦14652 Aram—to go¦14654 \add back\add* to Isaac¦14657 his father¦14658 in the Canaan¦14660 region.
\v 19 \add Now\add* Lavan had gone \add off for several days\add* to shear¦14664 his sheep¦14667, so Rahel stole¦14668 the idols that belonged¦14674 to her¦14674 father¦14674,
\v 20 and Yacob¦14677 \add deceived\add* Lavan (the Syrian) by not telling him that \add they all\add* were leaving.
\v 21 \add So¦14692\add* Yacob \add took his household\add* and everything that belonged to \add them\add* and crossed the \add Euphrates\add* River and \add headed upward\add* toward the hill-country of Gilead¦14709.
\s1 Lavan catches up to Yacob
\rem /s1 Laban Overtakes Jacob; Laban Pursues Jacob
\p
\v 22 Three days later, Lavan was \add informed\add* that Yacob¦14717 had fled \add with his family\add*,
\v 23 \add so\add* he took¦14719 \add some of\add* his relatives with him¦14725 and chased after¦14725 Yacob \add and his family\add* for seven¦14727 days¦14728 until they overtook \add them\add* in the hill-country of Gilead¦14732.
\v 24 \add But¦14734\add* that night¦14741 God¦14735 \add appeared\add* to Lavan the Syrian in a dream¦14740 and¦14742 told him, “Watch yourself¦14745 that you¦14748 don't \add say anything to\add* Yacob¦14751, either good¦14752 or bad¦14755.”
\v 25 \add When\add* Lavan had caught up to Yacob, Yacob had pitched \add their\add* tents in the hills, so Lavan with his relatives \add also\add* pitched theirs on the Gilead¦14774 hills.
\p
\v 26 Then¦14776 Lavan said¦14776 to Yacob¦14778, “What have you¦14780 done? \add You've deceived¦14781 me\add* and carried¦14785 away my¦14784 daughters¦14788 like \add prisoners of war\add*.
\v 27 Why did you flee secretly and deceive¦14795 me and not tell me? I would have sent¦14801 you \add all off\add* with \add music and singing and a cheery party\add*.
\v 28 You didn't let me kiss¦14809 my grandchildren \add goodbye\add* and¦14811 my daughters¦14811, \add instead you¦14813 made a foolish¦14813 decision\add*.
\v 29 \add I have the right and¦14823 the ability to punish\add* you¦14821, but last night¦14825 your¦14824 father's¦14824 God¦14823 told me, ‘\add Be careful not to\add* speak either good¦14836 or bad¦14839 to Yacob¦14835.’
\v 30 \add So¦14841\add* now, you probably left because you miss your father's place badly, \add but\add* why did you steal¦14851 my gods¦14854?”
\p
\v 31 “\add We left like that,\add*” Yacob¦14857 answered¦14856 Lavan, “because I was afraid¦14861, because I said that perhaps you would \add use force to take\add* your \add married\add* daughters¦14869 from me.
\v 32 \add As for your idols,\add* whoever you find your gods¦14877 with will \add be put to death\add*. Look through everything we have and take¦14887 \add back anything that\add* belongs to you, with our relatives \add as witnesses\add*.” (Now Yacob¦14893 didn't know that Rahel had stolen¦14896 them.)
\p
\v 33 \add So¦14898\add* Lavan \add inspected\add* Yacob's¦14901 and Le'ah's tents, and the tent of the two slave women, but he didn't find anything. Then¦14898 he came out of Le'ah's tent and went into Rahel's tent.
\v 34 Now Rahel had taken¦14918 the idols and put them in the camel's¦14924 saddle¦14923 \add which she was now\add* sitting on, \add so although\add* Lavan searched¦14927 throughout \add her\add* entire¦14931 tent, he didn't find them,
\v 35 and she said¦14937 to her¦14940 father¦14940, “Don't let my master¦14945 \add be upset\add* that I'm not able to stand up in your¦14950 presence¦14950, because \add I have the regular female concern at the moment\add*.” So¦14937 he searched¦14956, but he didn't find the idols.
\p
\v 36 \add So¦14963\add* Yacob¦14964 \add got very angry\add* and he argued with Lavan, demanding from \add him\add*, “What's my crime? What's my sin¦14975, that you've hotly¦14977 chased after¦14978 me?
\v 37 Since you've searched¦14982 through all \add our¦15002\add* things, what things from \em your\em* house¦14994 have you found? Put it here in front of my relatives and your relatives, and let them judge between¦15001 the two of us!
\p
\v 38 “I've \add worked\add* for you¦15008 for twenty¦15005 years. Your ewes and your female¦15010 goats¦15010 didn't miscarry¦15012, and I haven't eaten¦15016 rams from your flocks¦15014.
\v 39 I didn't bring \add dead sheep or goats\add* to you¦15022 \add that had been attacked by wild animals¦15018\add*—I bore the loss of \add those\add* myself. You required¦15026 \add that I cover anything\add* stolen during the day¦15028 or during the night¦15030.
\v 40 I was \add always out there\add*—during the day¦15033 the heat \add tormented\add* me, and at night¦15037 the frost \add so bad that I couldn't sleep¦15039\add*.
\v 41 That's how it was for me for twenty¦15045 years in your house¦15047. I \add worked for you for\add* fourteen years for your two daughters¦15054, then six \add more\add* years for your flocks¦15057, and you changed¦15058 my wages¦15061 ten times¦15063 \add to your advantage\add*.
\v 42 If my father's¦15067 God—the God of Abraham¦15069 and the one Yitshak respected—had not been with me, surely you would have sent¦15077 me away empty-handed¦15076 now. God has seen¦15086 my suffering and \add my hard work\add*, and last night¦15089, he rebuked¦15088 you.”
\s1 Yacob and Lavan make a treaty
\rem /s1 Jacob's Treaty with Laban; Laban and Jacob Make a Covenant; The Agreement between Jacob and Laban
\p
\v 43 Then¦15091 Lavan responded¦15093 and told Yacob¦15096, “\add These women\add* are my daughters, and the children are my grandchildren, and the flocks are my flocks. Everything that you see \add here\add* belongs to me. But¦15091 what can I do today about these¦15115 daughters of mine or about their¦15118 children that they gave birth to?
\v 44 \add So¦15122\add* come¦15123 now, let's make an agreement, I¦15126 and you, and let it¦15128 be a witness¦15129 between me and you.”
\p
\v 45 So¦15133 Yacob¦15134 took¦15133 a stone¦15135 and \add stood it up longways\add* as a pillar¦15137,
\v 46 then \add he instructed\add* his relatives, “Gather¦15140 stones.” So¦15139 they \add fetched\add* stones and made a pile, then they ate there¦15150 by the pile.
\v 47 Lavan gave the pile \add the Aramaic name\add* ‘Jegar¦15159 Sahadutha¦15160’ \add (which means ‘pile that reminds’)\add* while Yacob¦15161 gave it \add the Hebrew name\add* ‘Gale'ed’ \add (which has the same meaning)\add*.
\p
\v 48 Then¦15166 Lavan said¦15166, “This pile is a witness¦15170 \add of the agreement\add* between me and you today.” (That's why he'd named it Galeed¦15181.)
\v 49 It's also \add named\add* ‘Mitspah¦15183’ \add (which¦15184 means ‘watchtower’)\add*, because he said¦15185, “May Yahweh¦15187 watch¦15186 between me and¦15189 you when we are hidden¦15191 one from the other¦15193.
\v 50 If¦15198 you \add mistreat¦15197\add* my daughters, or if you take \add other\add* wives¦15204 besides my daughters, even though there's not someone \add there to see it\add*, listen, God¦15212 \add will be\add* a witness¦15213 between me and you.”
\v 51 Then¦15217 Lavan said¦15217 to Yacob¦15219, “Look at this pile \add of stones\add*, and look at the pillar¦15225 which¦15227 I set up between me and you¦15230.
\v 52 This pile is a witness and the pillar is a witness that I won't go past these to you, and that you won't go past these to me to do harm.

\v 2 and when he saw them, Yacob¦15308 said, “This \add must be\add* God's army camp.” So he named that place ‘Mahanaim’ \add (which means ‘two camps’)\add*.
\s1 Yacob sends gifts ahead for Esaw
\rem /s1 Jacob Sends Presents to Appease Esau
\p
\v 3 Then Yacob¦15319 sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esaw in the Se'ir region in the country of Edom,
\v 4 instructing them, “This is what you'll say to my master, to Esaw¦15340: ‘This is what your servant Yacob¦15335 says, “I have been staying with \add Uncle\add* Lavan and have remained there until now.
\v 5 \add Now\add* I have cattle and donkeys, flocks, and male and female slaves. And I've sent \add these messengers\add* to speak with my master¦15353, so that I'll find favour in your¦15357 eyes.” ’ ”
\p
\v 6 \add In due course\add* the messengers returned to Yacob, saying, “We went to your¦15383 brother Esaw and \add now\add* he's coming to meet you along with his four hundred men!”
\v 7 \add This¦15398 made\add* Yacob¦15390 very scared and distressed, so he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two groups,
\v 8 \add reasoning\add*, “If Esaw comes and attacks one camp, then the camp that's left can escape.”
\p
\v 9 Then \add he prayed\add*, “Yahweh, God of my grandfather Abraham, and God of my father Yitshak, who said¦15432 to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives, and I will cause things to prosper with you,’
\v 10 I'm unworthy of all the kindnesses and of all the faithfulness that you¦15463 have shown \add me\add* your slave, because I crossed this Jordan \add River\add* with \add only\add* my staff, but now I've become two camps.
\v 11 Please save me from my brother Esaw, because I'm afraid that he'll come and attack me and the mothers with the children.
\v 12 But you said,\x + \xo 32:12: \xt Gen 22:17.\x* ‘I will surely cause things to prosper with you, and I'll make your descendants as \add numerous as\add* the sand \add grains on the beach\add* which are too many to be counted.’ ”
\p
\v 13 Then he stayed there for that night and he \add selected\add* gifts for his brother Esaw from what he had with him:
\v 14 two hundred female and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
\v 15 thirty milk camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female¦15543 and ten male donkeys.
\v 16 Then he \add handed them over\add* to his slaves, each herd by itself, and he \add ≈told them\add*, “Go ahead of me \add one by one\add*, and \add keep a\add* space between each herd.”
\v 17 And he instructed the first one, saying, “When Esaw my brother meets you and asks you, saying, ‘Who do you belong to, and where are you going? And who do those animals belong to?’
\v 18 then you \add should answer\add*, ‘They belong to your¦15609 servant Yacob. They are a gift sent to my master Esaw¦15597. \add In fact, he's coming along\add* behind us.’ ”
\v 19 Then \add Yacob¦15614\add* also instructed the second and third slaves, as well as everyone who followed behind¦15624 the herds, \add telling them\add*, “Say the same thing to Esaw¦15619 when you find him,
\v 20 and also say, ‘Look, your servant Yacob is behind¦15642 us.’ ” \add Yacob was thinking\add*, “I'll \add cheer him up\add* with the gifts that are going ahead of me, and after that, when I see \add him in person\add*, perhaps he'll \add accept me\add*.”
\v 21 \add So\add* the gifts went ahead¦15668 of him, and he himself stayed in the camp for that night.

\p
\v 22 Then during that night, \add Yacob\add* got up and took his two wives and \add their\add* two female slaves and his eleven sons and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok \add Stream\add*.
\v 23 \add After¦15713\add* crossing¦15710 the stream, he \add also\add* sent across \add everything else that\add* belonged to him.
\v 24 Then Yacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until dawn.\x + \xo 32:24-26: \xt Hos 12:3-4.\x*
\v 25 \add When the man¦15734 realised\add* he wasn't gaining on him, he touched \add Yacob¦15731\add* on the socket of his hip so that it became dislocated as \add they\add* wrestled¦15733 with \add each other\add*.
\v 26 Then \add the man\add* said, “Release me \add now\add*, because it's \add already\add* dawning.”
\p “I won't release you until you bless me,” Yacob¦15754 \add ≈responded\add*.
\v 27 “What's your name?” the man \add asked\add*.
\p “Yacob,” he \add ≈replied\add*.
\p
\v 28 “You won't be called Yacob¦15779 anymore,” the man said, “but \add you'll be\add* ‘Yisra'el’ \add (or ‘Israel’, which means ‘he struggled with God’)\add*, because you have struggled with God and with men, and you won.”\x + \xo 32:28: \xt Gen 35:10.\x*

\v 30 \add So\add* Yacob¦15805 named the place ‘Penu'el’ \add (also spelt ‘Peni'el’, which means ‘God's face’)\add*, because he said, “I saw God face to face, yet my life was preserved.”
\v 31 And the sun rose above him as he passed through Penu'el, and he was limping because of his hip.
\v 32 That's why Israelis don't eat the muscle of the tendon that is on the hip socket to this day, because \add the man\add* touched the socket of Yacob's hip on the muscle of the tendon.

\v 3 Then¦15930 he himself went¦15939 ahead¦15932 of them, and he bowed¦15933 to the ground seven¦15935 times¦15936 as he approached his brother.
\v 4 \add But¦15944\add* Esaw¦15945 ran¦15944 \add forward\add* to meet him and embraced¦15947 him and \add threw his arms around\add* his neck and kissed¦15953 him, and they \add both\add* cried \add together\add*.
\v 5 Then¦15957 \add Esaw looked up\add* and saw¦15961 the women¦15964 and the children, and \add asked\add*, “Who are these¦15971 \add others\add* with you¦15972?”
\p “The children that God¦15978 has graciously given to your¦15981 servant¦15981,” Yacob replied.

\v 8 Then¦16001 \add Esaw asked\add*, “What were all these groups that I met?”
\p “To \add win\add* my master's¦16015 favour¦16013,” Yacob \add ≈replied\add*.
\p
\v 9 “I've got plenty, my brother¦16023,” said¦16017 Esaw¦16018. “\add Keep\add* what belongs¦16024 to you.”
\p
\v 10 “No, please,” Yacob¦16031 \add insisted\add*. “If I've \add won\add* your favour, then take my gifts. Because indeed, I've seen you face-to-face, which is like seeing¦16050 God's face, and you've received¦16053 me \add favourably\add*.
\v 11 Please take my \add gifts\add* that were brought¦16062 to you, because¦16068 God¦16067 has been gracious¦16066 to me and I have \add way more than I need\add*.”
\p And he urged¦16074 him, so \add Esaw\add* took¦16077 it
\v 12 and said, “\add Okay,\add* let's get moving and go, and I'll go ahead of you.”
\p
\v 13 But¦16085 \add Yacob replied\add*, “My master¦16087 knows that the children are tender plus I have flocks and herds¦16094 \add with young animals\add*. If they¦16097 drive¦16097 them \add harder today\add*, then all the flocks will die¦16100.
\v 14 Please let my master go on before his servant¦16110, and I'll lead them on at my gentle pace—at the pace of the livestock¦16116 that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children—until¦16122 I come to my master's \add place\add* in Se'ir.”
\p
\v 15 “\add At least\add* let me leave some of my men with you \add all\add*,” said Esaw¦16132.
\p “Why do that?” \add contradicted Yacob\add*. “May my master¦16149 \add allow me to decide\add*.”
\v 16 \add So¦16151\add* Esaw¦16154 \add and his men\add* started heading \add home\add* to Se'ir¦16156,

\v 1 \add One day,\add* Yacob¦16232 and Le'ah's daughter¦16227 Dinah¦16226, went¦16225 out to \add visit some of\add* the \add local women¦16234\add*,

\v 3 \add Shekem¦16257 admired Dinah¦16254 so much that he fell in love with her\add* and spoke¦16262 \add sweetly to her to try to cultivate a relationship\add*.
\v 4 Then¦16268 \add he asked\add* Hamor¦16272 his father¦16273, “Get¦16269 this girl¦16280 for me as a wife.”
\p
\v 5 \add When\add* Yacob heard¦16285 that \add Shekem\add* had dishonoured his daughter¦16291 Dinah¦16290, his sons¦16292 were \add out\add* in the fields¦16297 with his livestock¦16296, so Yacob \add waited quietly\add* until¦16300 they \add got home\add*.
\v 6 \add Meanwhile\add* Shekem's father¦16306 Hamor¦16305 \add took Shekem\add* to \add negotiate\add* with Yacob¦16311.
\v 7 \add In due course\add* Yacob's sons¦16315 came¦16317 \add home\add* from the fields¦16320. When they heard¦16321 \add what had happened\add*, then they¦16323 were \add very angry and upset\add*, because \add Shekem\add* had done something disgraceful¦16329 to Yisra'el by \add taking advantage of\add* Yacob's daughter¦16335. \add Something like that should never have happened\add*.
\v 8 \add But¦16342\add* Hamor¦16343 spoke¦16342 with them, saying, “My son Shekem¦16346 my son \add is madly in love with\add* your¦16350 daughter¦16350. Please give¦16351 her to him as a wife.
\v 9 \add In fact, why don't you allow us to marry\add* your daughters, and you \add people could have\add* our daughters \add to marry\add*,
\v 10 then you could settle \add here permanently\add* with us. \add This region would open up to you all so\add* settle in it and trade¦16375 \add with us\add* and \add you could\add* buy \add more land around here\add*.”
\p
\v 11 Then¦16379 Shekem¦16380 spoke to \add Dinah's\add* father¦16383 and brothers¦16387, “\add Look kindly on my request\add* and I'll give¦16395 \add whatever you¦16393 ask for\add*.
\v 12 \add Set any very high amount for\add* the bride-price¦16400 and gifts \add from\add* me, and I'll give \add whatever you ask\add*—\add just\add* give the young woman¦16412 to me as a wife.”
\p
\v 13 \add But¦16414 because\add* Shekem had \add abused\add* their¦16431 sister¦16431 Dinah¦16430, Yacob's¦16417 sons¦16415 \add gave a false answer¦16414\add* to Shekem and his father¦16424,
\v 14 \add stating\add*, “\add Sorry¦16441,\add* we can't do that because it would be a disgrace \add in our culture\add* to allow a man¦16444 with a foreskin¦16448 \add to marry her\add*.
\v 15 We'd only consent \add to your proposal\add* if you'd become like us by circumcising¦16463 every¦16465 male¦16467 among you,
\v 16 Then¦16469 we'd give our daughters to you \add to marry\add*, and we'd take your daughters for us \add to marry\add*. And we'd settle among you, and we \add all\add* would become¦16482 one \add united\add* people¦16483.
\v 17 \add But¦16486\add* if you¦16489 all won't \add agree\add* to get circumcised¦16491, then we'll \add just\add* take¦16492 \add Dinah¦16493\add* and go¦16496.”
\p
\v 18 \add This idea\add* pleased¦16498 Hamor¦16501 and¦16502 his son,
\v 19 \add so Shekem\add* didn't delay¦16510 \add implementing the plan\add* because he was the most honoured¦16520 son in his father's¦16523 household¦16522, and he was so delighted¦16515 with Yacob's¦16518 daughter¦16516.
\p
\v 20 So¦16525 Hamor¦16526 and Shekem¦16527 went¦16525 to \add the city elders at\add* the gate of their city, and they spoke¦16533 to them, saying,
\v 21 “These men are peaceful¦16542 towards us, so let them settle in the land, and let them trade¦16547 in it. And look, the land \add is plenty wide enough for them as well\add*.

\v 22 \add But\add* they'll only consent to settle among us and unite with us on this \add condition\add*: we would need to circumcise all of the males amongst us, just like they're circumcised.
\v 23 Won't all of their livestock and their property¦16589 and all their animals¦16592 then belong to us? \add So\add* let's agree¦16597 with \add their condition\add* and then they'll settle among¦16600 us.”
\v 24 All \add the elders\add* at the city gate \add agreed with\add* Hamor¦16605 and his son Shekem¦16608, and \add so\add* every¦16616 male who \add passed through\add* the city gate was circumcised¦16615.

\v 7 He built¦16884 an altar¦16886 there and named the place¦16888 ‘El Beyt-El’ \add (which means ‘the God of Beyt-El’)\add*, because God had revealed¦16895 himself to him there when he was fleeing from his brother \add Esaw\add*.

\v 2 This is \add the record of his\add* descendants:
\p When Yosef \add (Joseph)\add* was seventeen¦17833, he was shepherding¦17838 the flocks¦17842 with his brothers. He was \add younger than his brothers\add* who were the sons of his father's \add slave\add* wives¦17853 Bilhah¦17848 and Zilpah¦17852. \add One day\add* Yosef gave a \add tell-tale\add* bad report¦17859 about them to their¦17863 father.

\v 5 \add One¦17910 night\add* Yosef¦17903 had a dream¦17904, and he told his brothers¦17906 about it, \add but\add* that made them hate¦17909 him even more.

\v 7 See, we were \add tying up bundles of grain stalks\add* in the middle¦17926 of a field¦17927, and wow, my bundle got up and stood¦17933 upright¦17933. Then¦17922 \add would you believe it\add*, your bundles gathered¦17935 around and bowed¦17937 down to my \add one\add*.”

\v 19 “Look, that master¦18126 \add dreamer¦18127\add* is coming¦18129,” they¦18120 said¦18120 to each other.
\v 20 “\add Here's our chance to\add* kill¦18134 him and throw¦18135 \add his body\add* into one of the pits \add around here\add*. We'll say¦18138 that a \add wild\add* animal¦18139 \add attacked\add* him. \em Then¦18131\em* we'll see¦18142 what his dreams¦18146 \add turn into\add*.”

\v 22 “Don't shed blood¦18165,” he continued. “Throw him into \add that\add* pit in the wilderness¦18173, but don't¦18161 \add wound\add* him.” \add He said¦18157 this\add* because he was planning to rescue¦18181 Yosef \add later\add* and return him \add home\add* to \add their¦18183\add* father¦18187.
\v 23 \add So¦18189\add* when Yosef¦18193 \add reached\add* his brothers¦18196, they \add grabbed him and ripped\add* off the coloured¦18207 robe¦18203 that \add he was wearing\add*.
\v 24 Then¦18211 they took¦18211 him and \add dropped\add* him into the pit. (The¦18213 pit was empty¦18216 with no water¦18219 in \add the bottom\add*).
\p
\v 25 Then¦18221 they sat down to eat¦18222, and \add a bit later when they looked up\add*, look, \add there was\add* a caravan¦18229 of Ishmaelites¦18230 coming¦18231 \add towards¦18240 them\add*. \add They had left\add* Gilead¦18232 carrying¦18239 spices¦18235 and balm and myrrh¦18237 on their camels¦18233 that they were going to take down to Egypt¦18240.
\v 26 Then¦18242 Yehudah¦18243 \add (Judah)\add* said¦18242 to his brothers¦18246, “What will we gain if we kill¦18251 our brother¦18254 and cover¦18255 up his blood¦18258?
\v 27 Let's sell him to \add these\add* Ishmaelites¦18262 \add so we won't be guilty of killing\add* him. \add After all,\add* he's our brother¦18271—our \add own\add* flesh¦18272 \add and blood\add*.” And his brothers¦18275 \add agreed\add*.

\p
\v 31 Then¦18330 they¦18330 slaughtered¦18335 a young goat¦18336 and took¦18330 Yosef's¦18334 robe¦18341 and dipped¦18338 \add it\add* in the blood¦18342.

\v 33 \add Yisra'el\add* recognised¦18366 it and said¦18367, “It \em is\em* my son's¦18369 robe. A \add wild\add* animal¦18370 \add must have eaten\add* him. Yosef¦18375 was \add almost\add* certainly torn to pieces¦18374.”
\v 34 Then¦18377 Yacob¦18378 ripped his clothes¦18379 and put sackcloth¦18381 \add around\add* his \add waist\add*, and he mourned¦18383 for his son many days¦18387.

\p
\v 1 \add Around that time¦18427\add*, Yehudah¦18430 \add (Judah)\add* went down \add the hills\add* from \add where\add* his brothers¦18432 \add were\add* and settled¦18433 near an Adullamite¦18437 man¦18436 named Hirah¦18439.
\v 2 There Yehudah¦18444 saw¦18441 the daughter¦18445 of a Canaanite¦18448 man¦18447 named Shua¦18450, and he took¦18451 her \add as a wife\add*. He \add slept with\add* her
\v 3 and she got pregnant¦18455 and \add in due course\add*, gave¦18456 birth¦18456 to a son who Yehudah named Er¦18462.
\v 4 Then¦18464 she got pregnant¦18464 again¦18465 and gave¦18466 birth¦18466 a \add another\add* son, and she named him Onan¦18469.
\v 5 Then¦18474 she \add got pregnant yet again¦18475\add* and gave¦18476 birth¦18476 to a \add third\add* son, and she named him Shelah¦18482. (\add Yehudah\add* was in Kezib when she \add Onan was born\add*.)
\p
\v 6 \add In due course,\add* Yehudah¦18489 took¦18488 a wife¦18490 for Er¦18491 his firstborn¦18492, and¦18493 her¦18493 name¦18493 was Tamar¦18494.
\v 7 But¦18496 Er¦18497 was evil¦18500 in Yahweh's eyes¦18501, so Yahweh killed him¦18503.
\v 8 Then¦18506 Yehudah¦18507 said¦18506 to Onan¦18508, “Go to your brother's wife¦18512 and perform¦18514 your \add brotherly\add* duty to her \add to\add* produce \add children\add* for your brother.”
\v 9 However, Onan¦18521 knew¦18520 that \add any children\add* wouldn't be his, so \add whenever\add* he \add slept with\add* his brother's wife¦18534, he spilled¦18536 \add his semen¦18536\add* on the ground so that he wouldn't give¦18539 \add children\add* to his \add late\add* brother.
\v 10 \add But¦18552\add* Yahweh¦18546 \add considered\add* what he did to be evil, so he killed him also.
\v 11 Then¦18554 Judah \add ≈told\add* his daughter-in-law¦18557 Tamar, “Remain a widow¦18559 in your father's house until¦18563 my son Shelah¦18566 grows up.” \add This was\add* because he'd said, “So that he doesn't also die like his brothers¦18576!” So Tamar went and lived in the house of her¦18581 father.
\p
\v 12 \add A long time afterwards\add*, Yehudah's¦18591 wife¦18589 (Shua's¦18588 daughter¦18586) died¦18585. \add After\add* Yehudah \add had finished mourning\add*, he and his friend Hirah¦18600 (the Adullamite¦18602) went to Timnah¦18603 to \add where\add* the men were shearing¦18597 his sheep¦18598.
\v 13 Then¦18605 Tamar¦18606 was told, “Look, your¦18609 father-in-law¦18609 is going¦18610 to Timnah¦18611 to shear¦18612 his sheep¦18613.”
\v 14 \add So¦18615\add* she \add changed out of\add* her¦18617 widow's¦18617 clothes¦18616 and covered¦18619 herself with a veil and wrapped¦18621 herself \add up\add*. Then¦18615 she sat¦18622 at the entrance¦18623 of Enaim¦18624 which¦18625 is on the road¦18628 to Timnah¦18629. \add She was doing this\add* because she had seen¦18631 that Shelah¦18635 had grown¦18634 up, but she hadn't been given¦18639 to him as a wife.
\p
\v 15 \add In due course,\add* Yehudah¦18644 saw¦18643 her and because she had covered¦18648 her face¦18649, he thought she was a prostitute¦18646.
\v 16 \add So¦18651\add* he turned to her beside the road and asked, “Please let me \add lie with\add* you,” because he didn't know that she was his daughter-in-law¦18666.
\p “What will you give¦18671 me \add in exchange\add*?” she \add asked\add*.
\p
\v 17 “I'll send \add you\add* a young goat from my flock¦18687,” he replied.
\p “But¦18679 what about \add something to keep now as\add* a pledge¦18692 until¦18693 you send it,” she \add bartered\add*.
\p
\v 18 “What pledge¦18698 \add should\add* I give¦18700 you?” he \add asked\add*.
\p “Your signet \add ring\add* and \add its\add* cord, and your staff¦18706 that \add you're holding\add*.” \add So¦18696\add* he \add handed\add* them to her and went¦18712 and lay with her, and she became pregnant¦18714 \add as a result\add*.
\v 19 Then¦18717 \add Tamar\add* got up and left, and she took off her veil and put her widow's¦18724 clothes¦18723 \add back\add* on.
\p
\v 20 Then¦18728 Yehudah¦18727 sent¦18726 his friend the Adullamite¦18734 to take the young goat and get the pledge¦18736 back from the woman¦18738, but he couldn't find her,
\v 21 \add so\add* he asked¦18742 \add some of the local\add* men¦18745, “Where's the temple prostitute who was at Enaim¦18751 beside the road¦18754?”
\p \add But¦18742\add* they answered, “There's \add never\add* been a temple prostitute \add around here\add*.”
\p
\v 22 \add So¦18762 Hirah\add* returned¦18762 to Yehudah¦18765 and \add ≈told him\add*, “I couldn't find her. \add What's more\add*, the men¦18770 of the place said that there hasn't been a temple prostitute¦18777 at that place.”
\p
\v 23 “\add Oh well,\add*” said¦18779 Yehudah¦18780. “Let her \add keep those\add* things for herself so that we don't¦18792 become¦18785 a laughingstock¦18786. Anyway, I \add did my duty by sending the goat¦18789\add*, but you couldn't find her.”
\p
\v 24 About three months¦18799 later, Yehudah¦18801 was told, “Your daughter-in-law¦18805 Tamar¦18804 has prostituted¦18803 herself, and \add not only that\add*, she's pregnant¦18808 from doing it.”
\p “Bring her out and let her be burnt \add to death\add*.” Yehudah \add demanded\add*.
\p
\v 25 \add So they got her and\add* brought¦18816 her out, \add but\add* she sent¦18818 a message to her father-in-law¦18821, saying, “It was the man¦18823 who these things belong to that got me pregnant¦18829.” Then she \add added\add*, “Please identify whose signet ring and cords and staff¦18837 these are.”
\p
\v 26 \add When\add* Yehudah¦18841 recognised¦18840 \add the items\add*, he admitted, “She's more \add in the right¦18843\add* than I am,\x + \xo 38:26: \xt 37:11.\x* because I didn't give¦18852 my son Shelah¦18853 to her.” \add But¦18840\add* he didn't \add lie with her again¦18858\add*.
\p
\v 27 When the time¦18863 came for \add Tamar\add* to give¦18864 birth¦18864, wow, \add she was going to have twins¦18866\add*.
\v 28 \add While\add* she was giving¦18870 birth¦18870, one \add of the babies poked\add* out a hand and the midwife¦18875 tied a scarlet¦18880 thread¦18880 \add around its wrist\add*, saying, “This one came out first¦18884.”
\v 29 \add However,\add* it pulled its hand¦18889 back in, then wow, its brother \add was delivered first\add*. Then¦18886 she\f + \fr 38:28 \ft It's not clear from the text who ‘she’ was—either the mother or the midwife. Similarly, the ‘he’ in the next sentence (and in the next verse) is presumably the father.\f* said¦18893, “How \add did you manage to\add* break out first?” So¦18886 he named him ‘Perez¦18901’ \add (which means ‘break out’)\add*.
\v 30 After that, his brother who had the scarlet¦18910 thread¦18910 on his \add wrist\add* was delivered, and he named him Zerah¦18913.

\s1 Yosef and Potifar's wife
\rem /s1 Joseph and Potiphar's Wife; Joseph in Potiphar's House
\p
\v 1 \add Meanwhile,\add* Yosef¦18916 had been taken down to Egypt¦18918, and an Egyptian man¦18925 named Potifar had bought¦18919 him from the Ishmaelites¦18928 who had taken him down there¦18931. \add Potifar was\add* the chief of the guards¦18924 for Far'oh¦18922 \add (Pharaoh¦18922)\add*.
\v 2 Yosef¦18937 \add lived\add* in the house¦18942 of his Egyptian¦18944 master¦18943, and Yahweh¦18934 was with him and he was successful¦18940 \add at his work\add*.\x + \xo 39:2: \xt Acts 7:9.\x*
\v 3 His master¦18947 \add noticed\add* that Yahweh was with him and that Yahweh made everything that he¦18954 did succeed¦18957,
\v 4 \add so\add* Yosef¦18961 earned his favour¦18962 as he served him. Then¦18960 \add Potifar¦18965\add* put him in charge of his \add entire¦18970\add* household¦18969 and \add everything that he owned\add*.
\v 5 \add From that time¦18979 onwards,\add* Yahweh blessed that Egyptian household¦18994 because¦18996 of Yosef¦18997, and Yahweh's blessing \add even extended\add* from everything in the home \add all the way out\add* to \add their\add* fields¦19008.
\v 6 \add Potifar\add* left all his belonging in Yosef¦19018's charge¦19016, \add so much so that\add* he didn't have to think about anything¦19023 else beyond \add what he wanted to eat\add*.
\p \add Now\add* Yosef \add had developed\add* into a well-built and handsome¦19034 \add young man\add*,
\v 7 and after¦19041 a while, his master's¦19047 wife¦19045 \add started to develop a crush on\add* him and told \add him\add*, “Come¦19053 to bed with me.”
\v 8 \add But¦19058\add* he refused¦19058 and told \add her\add*, “Listen, with me here, my master¦19064 doesn't \add have to\add* think about what's in the house¦19073 and \add he's put me in charge of everything\add*.
\v 9 In this house¦19085, he doesn't \add even\add* have more authority than I do and he hasn't kept anything¦19092 back from me, except for you, his wife. How could I do this very wicked¦19103 thing and sin¦19106 against¦19107 God¦19107.
\v 10 \add But¦19109\add* she kept persisting with Yosef¦19113 day \add after\add*, \add but\add* he wouldn't lie with her like she wanted.
\p
\v 11 Then¦19126 \add one\add* day¦19127 when he went into the house to do his work and there¦19137 were no other men of the house \add around\add*,
\v 12 \add Potifar's wife\add* grabbed Yosef's cloak and demanded, “\add Come to bed\add* with me.” \add But¦19140\add* he \add pulled away and \add* fled outside¦19150 \add the house\add*, leaving her¦19147 \add there\add* holding his cloak.
\v 13 \add As¦19154 soon as it registered\add* that he'd fled outside¦19160 leaving his cloak \add behind\add*,
\v 14 she \add yelled\add* for the other male slaves and told them, “Look, he brought¦19169 a Hebrew¦19172 \add here\add* man¦19171 to \add mock\add* at us. He \add tried to get me onto the bed\add*, but I yelled out loudly.
\v 15 When he \add grasped\add* that \add I was screaming for help\add*, he left his cloak here and \add just took off\add* outside¦19195.”
\p
\v 16 \add Potifar's wife\add* kept the cloak beside¦19199 her until¦19200 \add her husband\add*, Yosef's master¦19203, got home¦19206,
\v 17 then she told him \add the same story¦19210\add*, “\add That\add* Hebrew¦19217 slave¦19216 that you¦19220 brought¦19220 \add into our home\add* came¦19213 to me to \add mock\add* me,
\v 18 \add but\add* when I¦19226 yelled¦19228 out, he left his cloak here and \add took off\add* outside¦19233.”

\p
\v 19 When Yosef's master¦19237 heard¦19236 his wife tell what his slave¦19251 \add had tried\add* to do to her, he \add became furious\add*.
\v 20 \add He¦19257\add* took him and threw him into the prison \add built\add* for the king's prisoners.
\v 21 \add But¦19277\add* Yahweh¦19278 was with Yosef¦19281 and was kind to him and \add caused the prison¦19291 warden to be pleased with him\add*,\x + \xo 39:21: \xt Acts 7:9.\x*
\v 22 \add so\add* the warden put him in charge of all the \add other\add* prisoners¦19304 and¦19308 \add Yosef¦19300 ended up being in charge\add* of everything that happened inside.

\s1 Yosef explains the dreams of two prisoners
\rem /s1 The Dreams of Two Prisoners; Joseph Interprets Two Dreams; The Cupbearer and the Baker; Joseph Interprets the Prisoners' Dreams
\p
\v 1 \add Sometime after¦19343 that\add* the Egyptian king's cupbearer and baker¦19351 sinned¦19346 against their¦19352 master¦19352, \add also known as Far'oh\add*.
\v 2 Far'oh¦19357 was angry¦19356 at those two¦19359 officials¦19360
\v 3 and he put them in the custody¦19370 of the chief of the guards¦19373—in the prison¦19378 where¦19380 Yosef¦19381 was \add also being held\add*.
\v 4 \add There\add* the chief of the guards¦19387 assigned¦19385 Yosef¦19390 to serve them.
\p After they'd been in custody¦19396 for quite some time,
\v 5 the king's \add cupbearer¦19408 and baker¦19409\add* in prison¦19416 each had \add separate\add* dreams on the same night¦19403, and each man's dream had its own interpretation.
\v 6 \add The¦19423 next\add* morning¦19421, Yosef¦19420 came¦19418 to them, and wow, they¦19424 were worried,
\v 7 \add so\add* he asked¦19427 the \add two former\add* officials¦19430 of Far'oh¦19431, “Why¦19428 are you looking so upset today?”
\p
\v 8 “We each had a dream¦19445 last night,” they¦19443 answered, “but there's¦19448 no one here who can tell us what our dreams mean.”
\p “God¦19454 is the only one who gives someone the ability to interpret¦19447 the meaning of dreams,” Yosef¦19452 replied. “Please tell me what you dreamed.”
\p
\v 9 Then¦19461 the chief¦19462 of the cupbearers¦19464 \add went first and\add* told his dream to Yosef¦19468, “Listen¦19465, in my¦19475 dream there was a grapevine in front¦19475 of me
\v 10 with three¦19478 branches on it. Then¦19477 as soon as the buds appeared \add on the branches\add*, its blossoms¦19483 came out \add straight away\add* and its clusters¦19485 ripened¦19484 into grapes¦19486.
\v 11 Then¦19488 I was holding Far'oh's cup and I took¦19491 the grapes¦19494 and squeezed¦19495 them into it and I gave the cup to Far'oh¦19489.”
\p
\v 12 “This is the interpretation¦19514,” Yosef¦19512 responded¦19510. “The three branches¦19516 \add represent\add* three days¦19518.
\v 13 Within three¦19523 days¦19524, Far'oh will \add display you publicly\add* and then restore¦19530 you to your position. Then you'll place Far'oh's cup into his hand¦19538, \add just like you used to before\add* when you were his cupbearer¦19543.
\v 14 But when it¦19551 \add all\add* goes well for you, if you remember¦19548 me then please¦19555 be kind and mention¦19558 me to Far'oh¦19561 \add to\add* get me out of this \add prison\add*,
\v 15 because indeed¦19570 I was trafficked from the land of the Hebrews¦19573. And even here, I didn't do anything¦19580 \add to deserve being held in this\add* pit.”
\p
\v 16 \add Now when\add* the chief¦19588 of the bakers¦19590 saw that \add this first dream was\add* interpreted¦19593 \add so\add* favourably, he told Yosef¦19597, “I also was in my dream, and listen, there were three¦19603 baskets¦19604 of white¦19605 bread¦19605 on my head.
\v 17 In¦19619 the top basket \add there\add* were \add various\add* kinds of food for Far'oh¦19614—baker's¦19616 goods—but the birds were eating¦19618 them out of the basket on my head.”
\v 18 “This is the interpretation¦19630,” Yosef¦19627 responded¦19628. “The three baskets¦19632 are three days¦19634.
\v 19 Within three¦19639 days¦19640, Far'oh¦19642 will \add display you publicly\add* and then impale you on a pole, and the birds¦19653 will eat¦19652 your flesh¦19656 \add off your bones\add*.”
\p
\v 20 Then¦19659 \add three days later\add*, \add it was Far'oh's¦19668 birthday\add* and he held a feast¦19670 for all his officials and he got the chief of the cupbearers¦19680 and the chief of the bakers¦19685 \add brought in to stand publicly\add* in the middle¦19686 of \add everyone\add*.
\v 21 Then¦19690 he restored¦19689 the chief¦19692 of the cupbearers¦19693 to his position¦19696, and \add the man carried\add* the cup \add across to\add* Far'oh¦19702,
\v 22 but he had the chief¦19705 of the bakers¦19706 executed, just like Yosef¦19711 had \add described in the interpretation¦19709 of the dream\add*.
\v 23 \add However¦19719,\add* the chief¦19716 of the cupbearers¦19718 \add completely\add* forgot¦19722 about Yosef¦19721.

\p
\v 1 \add Some two¦19727 years¦19727 later\add*, \add King\add* Far'oh¦19729 had a dream¦19730 and \add in it\add*, he was standing¦19732 beside the Nile \add River\add*.
\v 2 Then¦19740, wow, seven¦19742 fine-looking and well-fed cows came up out of the river, and they grazed¦19748 among the reeds¦19749.
\v 3 \add But¦19751\add* wow, seven¦19752 ugly, skinny cows came up out of the river after¦19756 them, and they stood¦19764 beside¦19765 the \add other\add* cows on the river bank.
\v 4 Then¦19778 the ugly, skinny cows ate¦19772 the seven¦19779 nice, fat cows, and then Far'oh¦19785 woke up.
\v 5 Then¦19787 he fell asleep¦19787 \add again\add* and had a second¦19789 dream¦19788. And wow, seven¦19792 good¦19798, fat heads of grain¦19793 came up on one stalk¦19795.
\v 6 \add But¦19800\add* wow, seven¦19801 thin heads of grain sprouted after¦19807 them—these heads of grain had been scorched¦19804 by the \add hot, desert\add* wind.
\v 7 Then¦19809 the thin heads of grain swallowed¦19809 up the seven¦19813 good, fat heads. \add At¦19812 that point\add*, Pharaoh¦19818 woke up, and \add realised that\add* it had been a dream¦19820.
\v 8 \add That\add* morning¦19823, Far'oh's spirit was troubled, so he sent¦19826 for all the sorcerers and wise men of Egypt¦19833 and \add he\add* told them his dreams¦19844, but no one could interpret¦19847 them for \add the king\add*.\x + \xo 41:8: \xt Dan 2:2.\x*
\p
\v 9 Then¦19851 the chief¦19852 of the cupbearers¦19853 spoke¦19851 with Pharaoh¦19856 saying, “I've¦19861 \add just\add* remembered¦19862 my \add broken promise\add* today.
\v 10 \add The king\add* had been angry¦19866 with his servants¦19869, and he put me in the custody¦19872 of the chief of the guards¦19875 \add in his prison\add*—me and the chief of the bakers¦19879.
\v 11 \add The¦19885 two of us each\add* had a dream \add one\add* night¦19883, and each of \add the dreams had different interpretations\add*.
\v 12 There was a young¦19894 Hebrew¦19895 man \add in there¦19892\add* with us—a slave¦19896 of the chief of the guards¦19898. \add When\add* we told him our dreams, he interpreted our \add two different\add* dreams for us.
\v 13 And it \add all\add* happened just as he'd interpreted¦19915 \add them\add*—I was restored¦19921 to my position and \add the baker\add* was \add executed\add*.
\p
\v 14 \add So¦19928\add* Far'oh¦19929 sent for Yosef¦19933, and they quickly¦19934 brought him \add in\add* from the pit. \add When¦19944\add* he'd shaved¦19938 and changed¦19939 his clothes¦19940, he \add was brought in\add* to \add the king\add*
\v 15 \add who told him\add*, “I \add had\add* a dream but no one could interpret it. \add However,\add* I heard¦19957 that you could listen¦19960 to a dream and \add explain what it means\add*.”
\p
\v 16 “\add No, it's not my ability\add*,” Yosef¦19966 responded, “\add but\add* \em God¦19972\em* will answer¦19973 \add the king to give him peace\add*.”
\p
\v 17 “In my dream¦19984,” Far'oh¦19980 told Yosef¦19983, “wow, I was standing¦19986 on the river bank
\v 18 and then listen, up from the river came seven¦19997 cows. \add They¦19995 were\add* well-fed and good-looking, and they grazed¦20003 among the reeds¦20004.
\v 19 Then¦20006 listen, seven¦20007 other cows came up after¦20012 them. \add They were in\add* poor \add condition\add* and very ugly and skinny—I haven't seen¦20021 cows that ugly \add anywhere in\add* Egypt¦20026.
\v 20 Then¦20033 the skinny, ugly cows ate¦20029 the first¦20036 seven¦20034 fat cows,
\v 21 \add but\add* you wouldn't know it¦20044 because their bellies \add were just as skinny as before\add* and they looked just as ugly as they had before. Then¦20039 I woke up.

\v 22 “Then¦20057 I \add had another\add* dream¦20058, and listen, seven¦20061 heads of grain¦20062 came up on one stalk¦20064. \add They were\add* full and good¦20067.
\v 23 Then¦20069 listen, seven¦20070 \add more\add* heads of grain¦20071 sprouted after¦20077 them, \add but they were\add* withered¦20072 and thin, and scorched¦20074 by the east wind¦20075.
\v 24 Then¦20079 the thin heads of grain swallowed¦20079 up the seven¦20084 good¦20086 heads of grain. I¦20083 told \add these dreams\add* to the sorcerers, but no one could explain \add them\add* to me.”
\p
\v 25 Then¦20095 Yosef¦20096 said¦20095 to Far'oh¦20099, “\add The king's\add* dreams¦20100 are one \add and the same\add*. God¦20106 has shown Far'oh what he's going to do.
\v 26 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years—\add both\add* dreams¦20123 \add mean the same\add*.
\v 27 And the seven thin and ugly cows that came up after¦20132 them are seven years, and so are the seven thin heads of grain scorched¦20139 by the east wind¦20140. There will be seven years of \add drought\add*.
\v 28 That's \add why\add* I told Far'oh¦20152 that God¦20154 has shown¦20156 \add him\add* what he's going to do.
\v 29 Listen, there's seven¦20162 years¦20163 coming of plentiful¦20165 \add harvests\add* throughout all of Egypt¦20170,
\v 30 \add but\add* seven¦20173 years of \add drought\add* will \add follow\add* after¦20177 them, \add such that the years of plenty will be quickly\add* forgotten¦20178 and famine will \add devastate\add* the land.
\v 31 \add Yes¦20201,\add* the \add time of plenty\add* won't be remembered because of the famine¦20196 \add that follows\add*—it'll be very \add severe\add*.
\v 32 And as for \add having two¦20213 dreams¦20209 with the same meaning\add*, it's because the matter¦20217 has been established by God, and¦20220 God will do it soon.
\p
\v 33 “So¦20224 now \add the king\add* should¦20225 find a man¦20227 who's discerning¦20228 and wise, and appoint him over \add all\add* Egypt¦20234.
\v 34 Then \add the king\add* should get him¦20236 to appoint¦20238 supervisors \add all across the country\add* to collect twenty percent of the \add crops\add* during the seven¦20248 years¦20249 of plenty.
\v 35 They should collect that \add surplus\add* food in the coming¦20260 good¦20259 years¦20258, and store¦20262 it in the cities¦20270 \add under¦20265 the king's authority\add*. It should be kept

\v 37 \add This idea sounded\add* good¦20290 to Far'oh¦20293 and¦20294 to all his servants¦20297,
\v 38 so he asked them, “\add Do we have any other\add* man¦20306 like this who has God's spirit¦20308 in him?”
\v 39 Then¦20312 he told Yosef¦20316, “Since¦20313 God¦20319 has shown you all this, there's¦20326 no one as discerning¦20328 and wise as you.
\v 40 You'll be over my household¦20336, and all my people¦20343 will \add obey your every word\add*. Only I on the throne will be greater¦20346 than you.”\x + \xo 41:40: \xt Acts 7:10.\x*

\v 41 Then¦20349 \add he added\add*, “See, I've put you¦20356 over all the \add entire¦20358 country\add*.”
\v 42 Then¦20363 \add he\add* removed¦20363 his signet¦20367 ring from his hand and put it on Yosef's hand, and he had him dressed in fine linen¦20380 clothes¦20376, and put a gold¦20383 chain¦20382 around his neck.\x + \xo 41:42: \xt Dan 5:29.\x*
\v 43 He had \add Yosef\add* ride in his¦20396 #2 chariot¦20390, and they called out in front¦20396 of him, “Bow down!” So¦20388 \add the king\add* put him over the entire¦20401 \add country\add* of Egypt¦20404.
\v 44 Far'oh \add also\add* told \add him\add*, “I'm Far'oh, and no person in all Egypt¦20427 will lift their hand¦20420 or foot¦20423 without¦20413 \add your¦20413 permission\add*.”
\v 45 Then¦20429 Far'oh¦20430 gave¦20436 him the Egyptian name¦20431 ‘Zaphenath¦20434-Paneah¦20435’ \add (which means ‘the one who reveals secrets’)\add*, and he \add presented him with\add* Asenath¦20441, the daughter¦20442 of Potiphera the priest¦20446 of On, as a wife. And Yosef¦20433 \add travelled throughout\add* the land of Egypt¦20454.
\p
\v 46 Yosef¦20456 was thirty¦20459 years old when he'd \add been called to\add* stand before Far'oh king¦20464 of Egypt. \add When he left\add* Far'oh's presence, he travelled¦20471 throughout the land of Egypt
\v 47 and the land produced¦20478 outstanding¦20483 harvests¦20483 during the seven¦20480 years¦20481 of plenty.
\v 48 For seven¦20492 years¦20493, he gathered¦20485 all the food throughout the land of Egypt¦20497 and had it stored¦20498 in the cities¦20501. The food from the fields¦20503 that surrounded each city, he put inside \add that city\add*.
\v 49 \add So¦20511\add* Yosef¦20512 stored¦20511 up so much grain¦20513 \add that it was\add* like sand \add on the beaches\add*, until¦20518 he \add eventually\add* stopped measuring¦20522 it because it \add too much to calculate\add*.
\p
\v 50 Before the years of the famine¦20535 came¦20533, Yosef¦20528 had two¦20530 sons¦20531 that Asenath¦20540 (the daughter¦20541 of Potiphera, the priest¦20545 of On) gave birth to.
\v 51 Yosef¦20549 named the oldest son ‘Manasseh¦20554’ \add (which means ‘forget’)\add*, because he said, “God¦20558 has made me forget all my hardships¦20563 and all of my family.”
\v 52 His second¦20572 son he named ‘Ephraim¦20574’ \add (which means ‘fruitful’)\add*, because he said, “God¦20578 has made me fruitful in the land of my difficulties.”
\p
\v 53 Then¦20582 the seven¦20583 years¦20584 of plenty in Egypt¦20589 came¦20582 to an end¦20582
\v 54 and the seven¦20592 years¦20593 of famine started, just as Yosef¦20598 had said¦20597. The famine \add covered the entire¦20601 wider region\add*, but \add it was different in\add* Egypt¦20607.\x + \xo 41:54: \xt Acts 7:11.\x*
\v 55 All the land of Egypt¦20615 became famished¦20611, and the people¦20617 cried¦20616 to \add the king\add* for food, so Far'oh¦20620 said¦20622 to all the Egyptians, “Go to Yosef¦20630 \add and\add* do whatever he tells you.”\x + \xo 41:55: \xt Yhn 2:5.\x*
\v 56 The famine was \add right across the country\add*, so Yosef¦20645 opened¦20644 all the grain stores and sold grain to the Egyptians. \add But¦20637\add* the famine in Egypt¦20657 was \add really\add* severe¦20654.
\v 57 Then¦20659 \add people from much further away started\add* coming to Egypt¦20663 to buy grain¦20664 from Yosef¦20667, because the famine¦20671 was severe¦20670 in the \add entire¦20659 wider region\add*.

\p
\v 1 \add Meanwhile (up in the Canaan region),\add* Yacob¦20677 \add heard\add* that there was grain¦20681 \add available\add* in Egypt¦20682, so \add he\add* said¦20683 to his sons¦20685, “Why are you¦20687 \add just standing there\add* looking¦20687 at each other?
\v 2 Listen, I've heard¦20691 that \add they're selling\add* grain¦20695 in Egypt¦20696. Go down there and buy some for us so that we¦20706 \add won't just starve to death here\add*.”\x + \xo 42:2: \xt Acts 7:12.\x*
\v 3 \add So¦20708\add* ten¦20712 of Yosef's¦20711 brothers¦20709 \add travelled\add* down to Egypt¦20715 to buy grain¦20714,
\v 4 \add but\add* Yacob¦20725 wouldn't send Benyamin¦20719 (Yosef's \add youngest\add* brother¦20720) with \add the others\add*, because he said¦20730, “I don't¦20722 want any harm to come¦20733 to him.”
\p
\v 5 \add So¦20736\add* Yisra'el's¦20738 sons¦20737 \add found themselves\add* among \add many others\add* who \add went¦20741\add* to buy grain¦20739, because the famine¦20745 was \add also throughout\add* the Canaan¦20747 \add region\add*.
\v 6 \add Now\add* Yosef was the governor¦20751 over \add all of Egypt\add* and he \add was the one there\add* who was selling grain to all the people¦20759. So¦20749 Yosef's brothers¦20762 \add approached\add* and bowed¦20764 down to him with their noses to the ground¦20768.
\v 7 \add When\add* Yosef¦20771 saw¦20770 his brothers¦20774, he recognized¦20775 them and acted like a stranger¦20776 to them, and he spoke¦20778 harshly¦20780 with them \add (through an interpreter)\add*, “Where \add are you¦20784 lot from\add*?”
\p “From the land of Canaan¦20787 to buy food,” they¦20785 \add ≈answered\add*.
\p
\v 8 Yosef¦20793 had recognised his brothers¦20796, but they¦20797 hadn't recognised him¦20799,
\v 9 and \add just then\add* he remembered¦20801 the dreams¦20804 that he had dreamed about them, \add so\add* he said¦20808 to them, “You are spies¦20810. You've \add all\add* come¦20817 to \add discover any weak points in this country's defences\add*.”\x + \xo 42:9: \xt Gen 37:5-10.\x*
\p
\v 10 “No, my master¦20822,” they \add ≈answered\add*. “Your servants¦20823 have \add only\add* come¦20824 to buy food.
\v 11 We're \add all\add* sons¦20830 of \add the same\add* man¦20831. We're \add being\add* honest¦20835. Your servants¦20840 are not spies¦20841.”
\p
\v 12 “No, you've definitely \add all\add* come¦20850 \add here\add* to see¦20851 \add where our land is vulnerable\add*,” \add Yosef insisted\add*.
\p
\v 13 “Your servants¦20856 are twelve brothers¦20857,” they¦20853 protested. “We're \add all\add* sons¦20860 of one man¦20861 in the Canaan¦20865 \add region\add*. \add It's all true\add*—the youngest is \add home\add* with our father¦20870, and one \add has passed away\add*.”
\p
\v 14 “\add Yes,\add* it's just as I said,” retorted Yosef¦20877. “You're spies¦20883!
\v 15 \add But\add* this is how we'll test you all: On Far'oh's life¦20888, you won't \add ever\add* leave this place unless your youngest brother¦20898 comes¦20897 here.
\v 16 \add Select\add* one among you to go and get your¦20903 brother¦20908, and \add the rest of\add* you will be \add imprisoned¦20910\add*. Then \add we'll find out if you've all been telling the truth¦20913\add*. And if not, on Far'oh's life¦20918, you're certainly spies¦20921.”
\v 17 Then¦20925 he had them \add locked up\add* together¦20924 for three¦20929 days¦20930.
\p
\v 18 On the third¦20936 day¦20935, Yosef¦20934 told them, “I'm a man who reveres God¦20942. So¦20932 if you do \add exactly\add* what I say, I'll let you live¦20939.
\v 19 If you are \add actually\add* honest¦20948, leave one of your brothers¦20950 \add in prison¦20954 here\add*, and you \add others\add* go¦20956 and take¦20957 grain¦20958 back \add to feed\add* your families.
\v 20 Then¦20962 \add when\add* you will bring¦20966 me your youngest brother¦20964 so that \add I can verify¦20968 your statements\add*, then you won't die¦20971.” So¦20962 they \add agreed\add*,
\v 21 saying to each other \add (in Hebrew)\add*, “We are truly guilty¦20982 concerning our brother¦20987 \add Yosef\add*, because we saw¦20989 the distress of his soul¦20991 when he pleaded¦20992 with us, but we didn't \add take any notice\add*. \add That's why\add* this \add predicament has happened to\add* us.”
\p
\v 22 “Didn't I \add beg\add* you \add all\add* not to sin¦21015 against the lad?” Reuben¦21005 spoke up. “But¦21004 you wouldn't listen¦21018, so now, see, \add now we're having to account for\add* his blood¦21021.”\x + \xo 42:22: \xt Gen 37:21-22.\x*
\v 23 (\add But¦21025\add* they didn't know that Yosef¦21030 understood them, because \add he and them had been speaking through an interpreter¦21032\add*.)
\v 24 \add Yosef\add* turned away from them \add briefly so they couldn't see his tears\add*, then he turned back toward them and spoke¦21040 to them. Then¦21035 he had Simeon¦21046 \add separated\add* from \add the group\add* and tied up in front of them.
\v 25 Then¦21051 Yosef¦21052 ordered \add his servants\add* and they filled their bags with grain¦21057, and he \add quietly\add* ordered them to return¦21058 each man's silver \add back\add* to his sack and to give¦21064 them provisions to them for the road.

\p \add After Yosef had provided for his brothers\add*,

\v 28 “My silver's been returned¦21105,” he¦21121 told his brothers¦21104, “and it's \add right here\add* in my sack!”
\p
\v 29 \add When\add* they \add got home\add* to Yacob¦21128 their¦21129 father¦21129 in Canaan¦21131, they told him everything that had happened¦21137 to them,
\v 30 “\add This\add* man¦21142, the master¦21143 of \add Egypt\add*, spoke¦21141 harshly¦21146 to us and treated us as if we were spying¦21149 out \add his country\add*,
\v 31 but we told him, ‘We're honest¦21156—we're not spies¦21160.
\v 32 We're twelve brothers¦21166, the sons of our father. One is \add no longer\add* alive, and the youngest¦21171 is with our father today \add back\add* in Canaan¦21177.’
\v 33 Then¦21179 \add that\add* man¦21181 told us, ‘\add I'll find out if you're honest¦21187\add*: Leave one of your brothers¦21189 with me, and take¦21197 grain for your families and go¦21198.
\v 34 Then bring¦21200 me your youngest brother so that I'll know you're not spies¦21209—that you're \add telling the truth\add*. Then I'll \add release\add* your brother and you can trade \add here freely\add*.’ ”

\p
\v 6 “Why did you all treat me badly by telling the man¦21394 you have \add a younger\add* brother¦21397?” \add their father\add* Yisra'el asked.

\v 21 \add But¦21666\add* when we \add got\add* to \add our\add* lodging¦21672 place¦21672 \add that evening\add*, we opened¦21673 our sacks¦21676 and \add got a shock because\add* each man's silver was in the \add top\add* of his sack—the full amount of our silver was there. So¦21666 we've brought¦21685 it back \add here on this trip\add*,
\v 22 plus we've brought¦21691 more silver to buy food. We don't¦21696 know¦21697 who put \add that\add* silver in our¦21692 sacks¦21702.”
\v 23 \add But¦21704\add* he said¦21704, “Peace to you—don't¦21707 be afraid. Your God and the God of your father¦21712 has given you hidden¦21715 treasure¦21715 in your sacks¦21716—\add I received your previous payment\add*.” Then¦21704 he brought¦21720 Simeon¦21724 out to them.
\p
\v 24 Then¦21726 the \add servant\add* took the \add brothers\add* into Yosef's¦21732 house¦21731. He \add had\add* water¦21735 \add given to them\add* and they washed¦21736 their feet¦21737, and he \add had\add* fodder¦21739 \add given\add* to their donkeys¦21740.
\v 25 Then¦21743 they \add got theirs gifts ready\add* for when Yosef¦21749 would arrive at midday, because they'd heard¦21752 that they would \add be given lunch\add* there¦21755.
\v 26 \add When¦21764\add* Yosef¦21760 \add arrived there\add*, they brought¦21762 \add their gifts\add* and they bowed¦21771 to the ground¦21774 \add in front of him\add*.
\v 27 Then¦21776 he asked¦21776 them about their \add living situation at home\add* and \add questioned\add*, “Is everything ok for your elderly father¦21781 that you \add ≈told me\add* about? Is he still¦21785 alive¦21786?”
\p
\v 28 “Things are well for your¦21790 servant¦21790 our father¦21791. \add And yes,\add* he's still¦21792 alive¦21793.” Then¦21788 they¦21788 bowed their heads¦21794 and bowed \add to the ground again\add*.
\p
\v 29 Then \add Yosef looked around\add* and saw his full-brother Benyamin¦21805, and asked, “Is this your youngest brother that you spoke¦21815 to me about?” Then he said, “May God¦21818 be gracious¦21819 to you, my son.”
\v 30 \add At¦21824 that point, Yosef¦21823 had to\add* hurry out \add of the room\add*, because \add he was so overcome with emotion¦21827 for his younger\add* brother that he needed to cry, \add so\add* he went¦21833 to \add his\add* inner room and cried there¦21836.
\v 31 Then¦21838 he washed¦21838 his face and came out, controlling¦21841 himself and \add ordering\add*, “Serve the meal.”
\v 32 \add So¦21846 the servants\add* served \add Yosef at his own table\add*, and served \add the brothers separately\add* and the Egyptians who were eating¦21852 with him \add separately again\add* (because Egyptians won't eat¦21859 \add together\add* with Hebrews¦21862, because Egyptians \add would find that demeaning\add*.
\v 33 \add At their table, the brothers were astonished to discover\add* that they¦21870 had been seated in order from the oldest to the youngest¦21874.
\v 34 Then¦21883 they were served¦21883 food \add Yosef's table\add*, but Benyamin's¦21890 serving was five¦21893 times larger than any of \add the others\add*, and they drank¦21895 and they and \add Yosef all\add* got a bit tiddly.

\rem /s1 The Missing Cup; Joseph's Silver Cup; Joseph Detains Benjamin; A Silver Cup in a Sack
\p
\v 1 Then¦21899 \add Yosef commanded¦21899 his head servant\add*, “Fill the men's¦21911 sacks¦21910 with grain, as much as they are able to carry¦21915, and¦21916 put each man's \add payment back into the top\add* of his sack.
\v 2 And¦21937 put my \add own\add* silver cup in the \add top\add* of the youngest one's sack \add along with his payment\add*.” So¦21923 he did \add what he was instructed\add*.
\v 3 The \add next\add* morning¦21941 at daylight, the \add brothers\add* and their donkeys¦21946 were sent¦21944 off \add to start their trip home\add*.
\v 4 They hadn't gone very far out of the city¦21952 \add when\add* Yosef¦21955 \add ≈told his head servant\add*, “Get up and, follow after¦21963 \add those\add* men¦21964. When you overtake¦21965 them, \add ask\add* them, ‘Why did you repay good¦21972 with evil¦21970?
\v 5 Isn't this \add the cup that\add* my master¦21978 drinks¦21977 from and indeed¦21981, what he divines¦21981 with? You've done evil¦21984 \add taking that\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 6 \add So¦21991 the servant\add* overtook¦21988 them and¦21989 \add did exactly what he'd been instructed to do\add*.
\v 7 But¦21996 they \add asked\add* him, “Why does my master¦22000 \add say that\add*? Far be it from your servants¦22004 to do something like that.
\v 8 \add Listen\add*, we brought¦22015 the silver that we found¦22012 in the \add top\add* of our sacks¦22014 back to you from the land of Canaan¦22018. So \add why\add* would we \add then\add* steal¦22020 silver or gold¦22025 from the house¦22021 of your master¦22022?
\v 9 If you find \add anything stolen with any of us\add*, \add that person can be executed\add*, and \add the rest of us can also be taken as\add* slaves¦22037 for my master¦22036.”
\p
\v 10 “Indeed,” the \add servant replied\add*, “according to your words¦22043, \add that's how\add* it'll be: whoever is found¦22048 with \add the stolen cup\add* will become my slave¦22053, \add but\add* you others will be \add free to go\add*.”
\v 11 So¦22061 each \add of the brothers\add* quickly¦22058 lowered¦22059 his sack to the ground¦22064, and each one opened¦22065 his sack.
\v 12 Then¦22069 \add Yosef's servant\add* searched¦22069 beginning with the oldest¦22070 and ending with the youngest¦22072, and the cup was found¦22074 in Benyamin's¦22077 sack.
\v 13 \add Seeing this, the brothers\add* tore their clothes¦22080 \add (as a sign of their distress)\add*, and each one loaded¦22081 up his donkey¦22085, and they \add all\add* returned¦22086 to the city¦22087.
\p
\v 14 \add When\add* Yehudah¦22090 and his brothers¦22091 \add got\add* to Yosef's¦22093 house¦22092, he was still¦22095 there¦22096, and they fell \add to their knees and bowed\add* to the ground¦22099 in front of him.
\v 15 “What's this that you've done?” Yosef¦22103 \add demanded\add*. “Didn't you know¦22111 that a man¦22116 like me can certainly divine¦22114 \add the truth\add*?”
\p
\v 16 “What can we say to my master?” Yehudah¦22121 \add ≈answered\add*. “What \add words\add* could we speak¦22128? How could we \add possibly\add* justify¦22131 ourselves¦22131? God¦22132 has exposed the sin of your servants¦22137. \add So¦22120 now\add*, we are slaves¦22139 for my master—both we and the one who was found with the cup.”
\p
\v 17 “Far be it from me to do that.” Yosef \add corrected them\add*. “\add Only\add* the man¦22156 who had the cup will become my slave¦22165, and \add the rest of\add* you can go¦22167 \add back\add* to your father¦22171 in peace¦22168.”
\s1 Yehudah pleads to Yosef

\p
\v 18 Then Yehudah¦22176 went closer to \add Yosef\add* and said \add quietly\add*, “Please, my master, please¦22182 let your servant speak¦22180 a word in my master's ears¦22185, and don't¦22187 \add get angry with me\add*, since you're \add as powerful as\add* Far'oh¦22194.
\v 19 My¦22198 master¦22196 \add previously\add* asked¦22197 his servants¦22200 \add if we had\add* a father¦22205 or another brother¦22208?
\v 20 And we answered to my master¦22213, ‘\add Yes,\add* we have an elderly father and \add also\add* the youngest¦22221 son of his old age. But¦22210 \add that son's\add* brother¦22222 is dead, so he \add alone¦22226 is left of his mother's¦22227 children¦22219\add*, and his father loves¦22229 him.’
\v 21 Then¦22231 you told your¦22234 servants¦22234, ‘Bring \add the other son here so I can see\add* him¦22235 \add myself\add*.’
\v 22 And we said to my master¦22244, ‘The young man isn't able to leave his father, because if he \add does\add*, then \add the old man\add* will die.’
\v 23 But¦22259 \add then\add* you said¦22259 to your servants¦22262, ‘If your youngest brother¦22267 doesn't come¦22266 with you, you won't \add get access to me\add* again¦22271.’
\p
\v 24 “\add After¦22285 all that,\add* when we went¦22277 \add back\add* to your servant¦22280 my father¦22281, we explained your words¦22286 to him, my master¦22287.
\v 25 \add Eventually,\add* our¦22290 father¦22290 \add ≈told us\add*, ‘Return \add there to\add* buy \add some\add* food for us.’
\v 26 But¦22299 we \add ≈told him\add*, ‘We can't go \add back unless\add* our youngest brother is with us, because we wouldn't be able to \add get access to that\add* man if our youngest brother wasn't with us.’
\v 27 Then¦22322 your¦22323 servant¦22323 my father¦22324 told us, ‘You know¦22327 that my wife¦22333 gave birth to two¦22329 sons for me.
\v 28 \add One of them\add* went¦22335 away from me, and I've \add assumed that\add* he was torn to pieces¦22341, and I've never seen¦22343 him \add again\add*.
\v 29 So¦22348 if you also take¦22348 this \add son away\add* and \add something happened to\add* him¦22356, then you'd bring¦22358 my¦22355 gray head down to \add the grave\add* in misery.’
\p
\v 30 “\add So¦22365\add* now, \add if I¦22366 was to return home\add* to your¦22369 servant¦22369 my father \add without that\add* young man, since his \add father's\add* soul is bound¦22375 to his soul,
\v 31 then \add as soon as\add* he sees¦22379 that the young man isn't \add will us\add*, then he'll \add have a heart attack\add* and \add so\add* your servants¦22386 will bring¦22385 the gray head of your servant¦22390 our father¦22391 down to \add the grave\add* in misery.
\v 32 \add But\add* your servant¦22396 guaranteed the young man to my father, saying, ‘If I don't¦22406 \add get\add* him back to you, then I will have sinned against my father all \add my life\add*.’
\p
\v 33 “\add So¦22415\add* now, please¦22418 let your¦22419 servant¦22419 stay as a slave¦22422 for my master¦22423 instead of the young man, and¦22424 let the young man go¦22425 \add home\add* with his brothers¦22428.
\v 34 \add So now,\add* how could I \add possibly\add* go \add home\add* to my father if \add that\add* young man isn't with me? I \add wouldn't be able to cope with\add* my father's misery¦22442.”

\v 6 There's \add already\add* been two years of famine¦22549 in this region, \add but\add* there's¦22556 still five more years to come without any ploughing or harvesting¦22559.

\v 28 \add As they all approached Egypt, Yacob\add* sent¦23320 Yehudah¦23319 ahead \add of the others\add* to find out from Yosef¦23324 how to get to Goshen. \add As they all\add* arrived in the Goshen area,
\v 29 Yosef¦23333 \add hooked up\add* his chariot¦23334 and went to meet his father Yisra'el \add there\add*. He \add went up to his father, and hugged him for a long time as he cried\add*.
\v 30 “Now I can die¦23358,” Yisra'el said¦23353 to Yosef¦23357, “since I've seen your face¦23364—\add seen\add* that you're still¦23366 alive¦23367.”
\p
\v 31 Then¦23369 Yosef¦23370 spoke to his brothers and to his father's household, “I'll¦23378 go and report to Far'oh¦23380 and \add explain\add* to him that my brothers and my father's household who were living in Canaan¦23390 have come to \add join\add* me.

\v 1 Then¦23449 went¦23449 Yosef¦23450 to Far'oh¦23452 and told \add him\add*, “My father¦23454 and brothers¦23455 and their flocks¦23456 and herds¦23457 and everything that \add belongs\add* to them, have come¦23462 from Canaan¦23464 and they're \add here now\add* Goshen¦23467 \add area\add*.”
\v 2 Then¦23469 he took¦23471 five¦23472 of his brothers¦23470 and presented¦23474 them to Far'oh¦23476,
\v 3 and Far'oh¦23479 \add asked them\add*, “What's your occupation¦23485?”
\p “Your servants¦23492 have been shepherds \add for several generations\add*,” they¦23486 \add ≈replied\add*.
\v 4 Then¦23500 they¦23500 \add explained\add*, “We've¦23503 come¦23506 to \add stay here for a while\add* because in Canaan¦23519, there's¦23509 no pasture¦23510 for our flocks¦23511 because \add the drought is very severe\add*.

\p
\v 7 Then¦23573 Yosef¦23574 brought¦23573 his father¦23578 Yacob and presented¦23579 him¦23579 to Far'oh, and Yacob blessed¦23582 Far'oh.
\v 8 “How¦23592 \add old are you\add*?” Far'oh¦23589 asked him.

\v 9 “\add I've been moving from place to place for\add* 130 years,” Yacob¦23599 \add ≈replied\add*. “\add My life¦23614 has been short and with many difficulties, so I\add* haven't reached¦23616 the longer \add ages of my ancestors¦23622 in their¦23624 moving around\add*.”

\p
\v 13 \add Then¦23673 the time came when\add* there¦23674 was no bread in \add that entire¦23675 part of\add* the world, because the \add drought\add* was now extremely severe, and \add both\add* Egypt¦23685 and Canaan¦23687 were \add suffering from food shortages\add*.
\v 14 \add People all over came\add* to buy grain, and \add over time\add* Yosef¦23692 had received \add in payment\add* all the silver that could be found¦23698 in Egypt¦23701 and Canaan¦23703, and \add he in turn\add* took it to Far'oh's house¦23714.
\v 15 So¦23717 \add once there was no more silver left\add* in Egypt¦23720 and in Canaan¦23722, all \add the Egyptians\add* demanded from Yosef¦23729, “Give us food. Why should we¦23736 die¦23736 \add right here in front of\add* you? \add All our money\add* is gone!”
\p
\v 16 “Bring your livestock,” Yosef¦23743 \add ≈answered\add*, “and I'll give grain to you in exchange for \add them\add*, since the silver is gone.”
\v 17 So \add the people\add* brought¦23754 their livestock to \add him\add*, and \add he\add* gave¦23761 them grain \add in exchange for their\add* horses¦23765 and sheep¦23767 and cattle¦23769 and donkeys¦23770. So he provided¦23771 them with food that year¦23776 \add in exchange\add* for all their livestock.
\p
\v 18 \add The next\add* year they came to \add Yosef\add* and \add begged\add*, “We can't hide it from our master¦23791 that since \add there's no silver left\add* and \add since all \add* the livestock \add now\add* belongs to our lord, there's nothing left \add to offer other than\add* our bodies¦23809 and our lands.
\v 19 Why should we die \add right in front of you\add*—both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will be slaves¦23830 to Far'oh¦23831. And give us seed so that we'll live and not die, and so that the land won't be barren.”
\p
\v 20 So¦23842 Yosef¦23843 bought¦23842 all the farmland of Egypt¦23849 for Far'oh, because every¦23855 Egyptian sold his field¦23856. \add In that way, all\add* the land became¦23862 Far'oh's because the famine¦23861 was \add so extreme\add*.
\v 21 \add As for\add* the people, he moved them to the cities\f + \fr 47:21 \ft TC: There's a variation here in different early copies and translations. Rather than moving the people into the cities (which might have been done to make food distribution more efficient), some translations choose the alternative ‘made the people slaves’.\f* from one end¦23872 of Egypt¦23875 to the other¦23878.
\v 22 The only land he didn't buy was that of the priests, because they \add were given a regular allowance¦23886\add* by Far'oh¦23889. Because they \add could live on what they were supplied with\add*, they didn't \add need to\add* sell their land.
\v 23 Then¦23907 Yosef¦23908 told the people¦23911, “Listen, now that I've bought¦23913 you and your land for Far'oh¦23919, here is seed for you so that you can \add work\add* the ground.
\v 24 \add Every time\add* you harvest¦23930 \add a crop\add*, you must give¦23931 a fifth¦23932 \add of it\add* to Far'oh¦23933. The \add other\add* four¦23934 parts¦23935 will be for you \add to use\add* as seed and as food for yourselves¦23940 and your households¦23942 and your young children.”
\p
\v 25 “You've kept us alive,” they¦23946 \add agreed\add*. “Master¦23952, \add continue to show us your favour¦23950\add*, and¦23953 we'll be slaves¦23954 for Far'oh¦23955.”
\v 26 So¦23957 Yosef¦23959 established it as a law to this day¦23963 concerning the Egyptian farmland: that the fifth¦23970 belongs¦23976 to Far'oh. (Only the priests' land didn't become Far'oh's.)

\v 2 When¦24101 someone told Yacob¦24093 that Yosef¦24097 had arrived, \add he\add* exerted himself and sat¦24102 up in bed,

\v 29 Then¦24854 Yacob instructed¦24854 them, “I'm about¦24859 to go and¦24856 join my ancestors¦24867. Bury me with them in the cave in the field¦24872 \add that was bought from\add* Efron¦24873 the Hittite¦24874,

\v 32 That field¦24924 and¦24925 the cave in it was bought from the descendants of Het.

\p
\v 1 Then¦24951 Yosef¦24952 \add hugged\add* his father¦24956 and cried over him and kissed¦24959 him.
\v 2 Then¦24963 \add he\add* commanded¦24963 \add those of\add* his servants¦24967 \add who were\add* physicians to embalm his father¦24974. \add So¦24963\add* Yisra'el's \add body\add* was embalmed
\v 3 over the next forty¦24984 days (which is the normal time for embalming¦24990), and the Egyptians¦24993 mourned for him for seventy¦24994 days.
\p
\v 4 After those mourning¦24999 days¦24998 were over, Yosef¦25001 spoke¦25000 to Far'oh's \add servants\add*, saying, “Please, if I have found¦25010 favour¦25011 in your¦25012 eyes¦25012, please tell Far'oh that
\v 5 my father made me swear¦25021, saying, ‘Listen, I am dying. You must bury me in my grave that I dug for myself in Canaan¦25031.’ So now, please¦25037 \add ask Far'oh to\add* let me go up there¦25032 and bury my father, then I'll return¦25042.”\x + \xo 50:5: \xt Gen 47:29-31.\x*
\p
\v 6 “Go¦25050 up and¦25047 bury¦25047 your father just like he made you¦25052 promise.” was the reply back from Far'oh¦25045.
\p
\v 7 So¦25054 Yosef¦25055 went up \add to Canaan\add* to bury¦25056 his father¦25059. Far'oh's servants¦25064 went with him, along with the elders from Far'oh's household¦25067 and all the elders of the land of Egypt¦25072.
\v 8 Yosef's own household also went, along with his brothers¦25077 and his father's¦25079 household. They only left their children¦25081 and their livestock behind in Goshen¦25086.
\v 9 There were chariots¦25092 as well as \add soldiers\add* mounted on horses¦25095 so it was a very large procession.
\p
\v 10 After they crossed the Jordan river, they arrived at Atad's threshing¦25104 floor¦25104, and they mourned¦25118 there¦25111 for seven¦25119 days¦25120 with very loud wailing.
\v 11 The local Canaanite¦25125 people saw¦25122 the mourning at Atad's threshing¦25129 floor¦25129, and they said¦25131, “This is \add very serious\add* mourning for the Egyptians.” That's why they then named that place across the Jordan ‘Abel¦25142 Mizraim¦25143’ \add (which¦25144 means ‘the Egyptians mourned here’)\add*.
\p
\v 12 \add So¦25148\add* Yacob's sons¦25149 did everything just how he'd instructed¦25153 them.
\v 13 \add They\add* carried¦25155 \add his embalmed body\add* to Canaan¦25159 and buried¦25160 him in the cave in Machpelah's¦25164 field.

\p
\v 15 \add Now that their¦25208 father¦25208 was no longer alive\add*, Yosef's brothers¦25202 said¦25209 \add to each other\add*, “What if Yosef hates us \add and now he decides to\add* repay us for all the evil \add things\add* that we did to him?”
\v 16 So¦25224 they sent¦25224 a messenger to Yosef¦25227 to tell him, “Before¦25229 he died¦25232, your father ordered that
\v 17 you be given this message: ‘I beg you, please forgive your brothers' crime and their sin¦25244, because they did evil \add things\add* to you.’ So now, please forgive the crime of the servants¦25253 of your father's God¦25254.” When Yosef¦25238 heard their message, he \add started\add* crying.
\p
\v 18 Then¦25261 his brothers¦25264 also came¦25261 and \add bowed to the ground in front of\add* him¦25266 and \add pleaded\add*, “Here we¦25268 are. We belong to you as slaves¦25270.”
\p
\v 19 “Don't be afraid,” Yosef¦25274 answered. “\add I'm not God¦25280 and it's not my job to decide on your punishment\add*.
\v 20 You all plotted evil things against¦25285 me, but God¦25287 intended it¦25288 for good¦25289 in order to do what he's doing this \add very\add* day¦25292: to save many people¦25295.
\v 21 So now, don't¦25300 be afraid. I'll support you¦25305 and your¦25308 little¦25308 ones.” So he reassured them and he spoke¦25311 \add kindly to them\add*.

\v 22 Yosef¦25317 continued to live in Egypt¦25318, along with \add the rest of\add* his father¦25321 Yacob's¦25323 family¦25320, until he¦25319 was 110 years¦25326 old.
\v 23 He lived long enough to see his son Ephraim's¦25330 children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. The children of his grandson Machir¦25335, who was Manasseh's¦25338 son, also grew up around him.
\v 24 Then¦25345 \add one day\add* Yosef¦25346 said¦25345 to his brothers¦25349, “I'm about¦25351 to die¦25351, but God¦25352 will definitely help you all and take you \add and your descendants\add* from this country to the land that he vowed to give to Abraham¦25367, Yitshak, and Yacob¦25369.
