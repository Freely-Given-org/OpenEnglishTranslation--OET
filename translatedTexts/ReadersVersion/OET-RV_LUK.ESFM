\mt1 Luke
\mt2 being the account of Yeshua's ministry
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua was written by Luke, one of the later followers of Yeshua. Luke was believed to be a medical doctor and although many have assumed him to be a Greek, there's also a good case that he was Jewish. He was good friends with Paul and accompanied him several times as they travelled to various places to spread the good message about Yeshua the messiah. Luke was also the author of the account of the beginnings of the Christian church known commonly known as \bk Acts\bk*, and unlike most other Bibles, the \em Open English Translation\em* places these two successive accounts one after the other.
\is2 This account
\ip This account was written to Theophilus who is said to be an honoured person from Rome. He starts his account with the prophesied birth of Yohan-the-immerser and then of Yeshua right through until he's lifted into the clouds. Luke also explains how that Yeshua is the messiah promised by God to save Jews and all non-Jews who put their trust in him.
\ip It's also told here in this document about Yeshua's mercy towards troubled people and sinners, his healing of many who were sick or possessed by demons, his bringing dead people back to life, and his teaching. Recurring themes here include God's spirit, prayer, forgiveness of sins, the women who helped Yeshua with his work, and how believers should prepare for his return.

\s1 Introduction
\rem /s1 Dedication to Theophilus
\p
\v 1 Several people attempted¦37265 to write an account about the events that we're personally certain of
\v 2 as the ones who were eyewitnesses¦37283 and¦37284 hearers of these accounts from the beginning¦37282 handed them over to us.
\v 3 So since we had followed¦37292 all these events so carefully, it¦37290 seemed like a good idea to write¦37298 this account for you¦37297, honoured Theophilus¦37300,
\v 4 so that¦37305 you could know¦37302 the definite background behind what you were taught.
\s1 The messenger foretells the birth of Yohan-the-immerser
\rem /s1 The Birth of John the Baptist Is Announced; The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold; The coming of Christ
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5: \xt 1Ch 24:10.\x*It started with the priest¦37319 Zekaryah \add (Zechariah)\add* and his wife¦37328 Elizabeth at the time when Herod¦37314 was the king¦37316 of Yudea¦37318. (Zekaryah was in the priestly division¦37324 of Abiyah, and Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron¦37334.)
\v 6 \nd God¦37348\nd* considered them both good and blameless¦37358 as they¦37341 followed his instructions and obeyed his rules.
\v 7 Elizabeth¦37367 had never been able to have a child¦37363, so there was just the two of them as they were now getting older.
\p
\v 8 One time¦37382 as he was taking his rostered turn to serve \nd God¦37394\nd* along with his division¦37389,
\v 9 he was chosen¦37400 by lot (this was how the priests¦37399 assigned tasks) to light the incense¦37403 in the temple¦37407, and so he proceeded inside.
\v 10 A lot of people¦37417 would be praying¦37419 outside¦37420 the temple at the time when the incense¦37424 was burnt.
\v 11 At that moment, a messenger¦37428 from God appeared¦37425 to Zekaryah, standing right there at the right of the incense¦37436 altar¦37434.
\v 12 Zekaryah¦37439 got a big fright at seeing him there and¦37437 started to tremble.
\v 13 But the messenger¦37452 spoke, “Don't be scared Zekaryah, because¦37457 your request has been listened¦37458 to, and your wife¦37464 Elizabeth¦37466 will give birth to a son and you'll name¦37475 him Yohan.
\v 14 He'll bring a lot of happiness to you and¦37478 you'll be proud of him¦37491—in fact many people will be glad.
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15: \xt Num 6:3.\x*He'll be considered special in God's eyes, but he won't¦37506 be allowed to drink¦37507 wine or spirits. Even while he's still¦37512 in his¦37518 mother's¦37517 womb, he'll be filled¦37511 with God's \nd spirit¦37509\nd*.
\v 16 He will turn many children of Yisrael back to \nd Yahweh¦37526\nd*, their¦37529 \nd God¦37528\nd*.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17: \xt Mal 4:5-6.\x*And he will go on ahead¦37533 of God with the spirit¦37537 and the power¦37539 of Eliyah, to turn fathers¦37544 back to loving their children¦37546 and to turn career criminals towards the wisdom of godly¦37551 people, to get the people ready for \nd Yahweh¦37554\nd*.”
\p
\v 18 Zekaryah asked the messenger¦37562, “How will I know if \add ≈you're telling the truth\add*, because¦37568 I'm an older¦37570 man¦37570 and¦37571 my¦37574 wife¦37573 is also getting old?”
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 1:19: \xt Dan 8:16; 9:21.\x*Now the messenger¦37583 rebuked him¦37585, “I am Gabriel¦37588 who stood¦37590 right in front of \nd God¦37593\nd* and was commanded to come here and talk to you, and to tell all of this to you,
\v 20 so listen to this: Because you didn't¦37608 believe¦37620 my¦37623 message¦37622, you'll be made silent¦37606 and unable to speak¦37610 until¦37611 the day¦37613 that¦37624 all of these¦37616 things happen, and they certainly will happen at the proper times.”
\p
\v 21 Meanwhile, the people¦37634 outside were expecting¦37636 Zekaryah to come back out, and¦37639 were wondering what could be holding him¦37645 up there inside the temple¦37648.
\v 22 But¦37664 when he did emerge, he wasn't able to speak¦37654 to them. They wondering if maybe he'd seen¦37660 a vision¦37659 in the temple¦37663, and¦37664 he nodded to confirm this although he remained mute,
\v 23 and¦37673 after he'd finished his¦37681 rostered days¦37678 in the temple, he returned home¦37686.
\p
\v 24 As time went on, Elizabeth¦37697 became pregnant and¦37701 secluded¦37702 herself¦37703 away for five¦37705 months¦37704, saying¦37706,
\v 25 “\nd Yahweh¦37712\nd* has done this for me. At this time he's looked¦37716 down at me and taken away the public shame of my¦37720 being childless.”
\s1 God's messenger comes to Maria
\rem /s1 The Birth of Jesus Foretold; The Birth of Jesus Is Announced
\p
\v 26 When Elizabeth was six months¦37726 pregnant, \nd God¦37737\nd* sent¦37730 his messenger¦37732 Gabriel¦37733 to \nd Nazareth¦37746\nd*, a city¦37739 in the Galilee¦37742 region.
\v 27 \x + \xo 1:27: \xt Mat 1:18.\x*Gabriel went to a young woman named Maria¦37765 who was engaged to be married to Yosef, a descendant of \add King\add* David¦37759,
\v 28 and entering the room, spoke to her¦37772, “Hello there. \nd Yahweh¦37779\nd* is with you and he's chosen you to be honoured.”
\v 29 Maria was very puzzled by the statement¦37793 and¦37797 wondered what kind of greeting¦37805 it could be
\v 30 as the messenger¦37811 continued¦37808, “Don't be scared, Maria¦37817, because¦37820 \nd God¦37824\nd* is showing his favour¦37821 on you¦37819,
\v 31 \x + \xo 1:31: \xt Mat 1:21.\x*and listen, you'll conceive¦37827 a baby and go on to give birth to a son, and you must name¦37836 him¦37837 \nd Yeshua¦37838\nd*.
\v 32 \x + \xo 1:32-33: \xt 2Sam 7:12-13,16; Isa 9:7.\x*He'll be very special and will be called¦37846 ‘the son of the highest¦37845 one’, and \nd Yahweh¦37851 God¦37853\nd* will give him the throne¦37855 of David¦37856, his¦37859 ancestor.
\v 33 He'll reign¦37861 over Yacob's descendants throughout the ages, and his¦37872 kingdom¦37871 will never end¦37875.”
\p
\v 34 “How would this work,” Maria¦37879 asked the messenger¦37882, “because¦37887 I've never slept with a guy?”
\p
\v 35 “The holy \nd spirit¦37898\nd* will come over you,” answered¦37893 the messenger¦37895, “and the power¦37904 of the highest¦37905 one will overshadow¦37906 you, and so the holy child¦37915 that'll be born will be called¦37916 God's son.
\v 36 Also, your¦37925 relative¦37923 Elizabeth¦37921 has also conceived¦37929 a son in her¦37933 old age—the one who was called¦37942 barren¦37943 is now six months¦37937 pregnant
\v 37 \x + \xo 1:37: \xt Gen 18:14.\x*because with \nd God¦37955\nd*, his statements always come to pass.”
\p
\v 38 “Listen¦37963,” said Maria¦37962, “I'm \nd Yahweh's\nd* servant girl. May everything you said come true.” Then¦37961 the messenger¦37979 left her.
\s1 Maria's visit to Elizabeth
\rem /s1 Mary Visits Elizabeth
\p
\v 39 Several days¦37986 later, Maria¦37983 determined that she'd go to the town in the hills of Yudea
\v 40 where Zekaryah and Elizabeth lived. She entered the house¦38002 and greeted¦38005 Elizabeth,
\v 41 and as soon as Elizabeth¦38019 heard¦38011 the greeting¦38015, her baby in her womb kicked¦38020, and she was filled¦38034 with the holy \nd spirit¦38035\nd*
\v 42 and she¦38041 called out loudly¦38044, “Out of \add all\add* women¦38050, you¦38057 have been blessed and the baby in your¦38057 womb has been blessed.
\v 43 How could this happen to me—that the mother¦38065 of my¦38068 \nd master¦38067\nd* would come¦38063 and¦38058 visit me!
\v 44 You see¦38071, as soon as I heard your¦38079 greeting¦38078, the baby in my¦38083 womb kicked¦38084 with excitement,
\v 45 and¦38095 the woman¦38099 who believed¦38100 that everything \nd Yahweh¦38108\nd* told her¦38106 will happen, she will be blessed¦38098.”
\s1 Maria's song of praise
\rem /s1 The Magnificat: Mary's Song of Praise
\p
\v 46 Maria¦38111 said¦38110,
\q1 “My¦38115 soul¦38114 praises \nd Yahweh¦38117\nd*,
\q1
\v 47 and¦38118 my spirit¦38121 is so happy about \nd God¦38126\nd*, my saviour¦38128,
\q1
\v 48 \x + \xo 1:48: \xt 1Sam 1:11.\x*because¦38140 he noticed his¦38138 humble servant girl.
\q1 Look now, all the future generations¦38148 will consider that I was blessed¦38144
\q1
\v 49 because the powerful¦38157 one treated me incredibly,
\q1 and¦38158 his¦38163 name¦38162 is holy.
\q1
\v 50 He shows his¦38167 mercy¦38166 to multiple generations;
\q1 to those who honour him.
\q1
\v 51 His¦38182 arm is powerful¦38179;
\q1 he scatters¦38183 those who are proud¦38184 in their¦38187 hearts¦38186.
\q1
\v 52 \x + \xo 1:52: \xt Yob 5:11; 12:19.\x*He knocks kings off their thrones¦38191,
\q1 and¦38192 praises those who are humble¦38194.
\q1
\v 53 Those who are hungry, he fills with good¦38197 things,
\q1 but those who are rich, he sends away empty¦38201 handed.
\q1
\v 54 He took¦38202 good care of his¦38205 servant¦38204, Yisrael,
\q1 to be reminded¦38206 of mercy¦38207
\q1
\v 55 \x + \xo 1:55: \xt Gen 17:7.\x*as he spoke¦38209 to our¦38213 ancestors¦38212,
\q1 to Abraham¦38215 and his¦38219 descendants¦38218,
\q1 at the right time.”
\p
\v 56 So¦38226 Maria¦38227 stayed with Elizabeth for about¦38230 three¦38233 months¦38232 before returning¦38235 back to her¦38239 own home¦38238.
\s1 The birth of Yohan-the-immerser
\rem /s1 The Birth of John the Baptist
\p
\v 57 When Elizabeth's nine months were up, she¦38250 gave birth and¦38249 produced a son
\v 58 and her neighbours¦38255 and relatives¦38258 heard¦38253 that \nd Yahweh¦38263\nd* had shown great mercy¦38265 to her, and so they celebrated along with her.
\p
\v 59 \x + \xo 1:59: \xt Lev 12:3.\x*When the baby boy was eight¦38279 days old, it was the time to circumcise¦38281 him, and¦38272 \add the relatives at the ceremony\add* started calling¦38285 him Zacharias¦38293 after¦38287 the name¦38289 of his¦38292 father¦38291,
\v 60 but¦38301 the baby's mother¦38297 spoke up and¦38294 said¦38299, “No, he's going to be named Yohan.”
\p
\v 61 “None of your¦38320 relatives¦38318 have that name¦38325,” they¦38308 said¦38308
\v 62 and¦38330 they signalled¦38329 to the father¦38332 to tell them what name¦38334 he wanted for the baby.
\p
\v 63 So¦38343 Zacharias requested¦38344 a writing tablet¦38346 and¦38343 wrote¦38347, “His¦38354 name¦38353 is Yohan.” Everyone was amazed
\v 64 and then¦38365 suddenly his¦38369 mouth¦38368 and tongue¦38373 were freed and he was able to speak¦38376 again and started praising \nd God¦38379\nd*.
\v 65 Everyone¦38398 who lived nearby was a bit unnerved by all this, and¦38392 the story about what happened was discussed¦38401 \add in all the homes\add* around¦38389 the hills
\v 66 and¦38407 those who heard¦38411 about it were thinking to themselves, “Who's this young child¦38424 going to turn out to be?”
\s1 Zacharias' prophecy about Yohan
\rem /s1 Zechariah's Song; Zechariah's Prophecy
\p
\v 67 Then¦38434 the boy's father¦38437, Zacharias¦38435, became filled¦38439 with the holy \nd spirit¦38440\nd* and¦38442 prophesied¦38443,
\q1
\v 68 “Blessed¦38446 is Yisrael's¦38451 \nd God¦38449 Yahweh¦38447\nd*,
\q1 because¦38452 he visited¦38453 us and made a way for his¦38461 people¦38459 to be freed from slavery.
\q1
\v 69 He brought us a voice that would lead to our salvation¦38465,
\q1 us citizens of \add the nation of King\add* David¦38470, his¦38473 servant¦38472
\q1
\v 70 (as he spoke¦38475 via the mouths¦38477 of his¦38486 holy prophets¦38485 through the age\add s\add*).
\q1
\v 71 He saved us from our¦38492 enemies¦38491,
\q1 and from the power of all the ones hating¦38498 us,
\q1
\v 72 to show mercy¦38501 to our¦38505 ancestors¦38504
\q1 and¦38506 to remind¦38507 them of his¦38510 holy agreement,
\q1
\v 73 that he had promised Abraham¦38515, our¦38518 ancestor, that he would give¦38520 us.
\q1
\v 74 He rescued¦38528 us from the power of our enemies¦38526,
\q1 so we could serve him¦38530 without fear,
\q1
\v 75 committed to obeying him¦38536
\q1 for the rest of our¦38545 lives.
\q1
\v 76 \x + \xo 1:76: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*And you too my little¦38549 child¦38549, will be called¦38552 a prophet¦38550 of the highest¦38551 one—

\v 77 to give¦38564 knowledge¦38565 about salvation¦38566 to his¦38569 people¦38568
\q1 so their¦38574 sins¦38572 can be forgiven¦38571
\q1
\v 78 because¦38576 \nd God¦38579\nd* has compassion¦38577 on us and mercy¦38578.

\q1 to guide us onto the road of peace¦38605.”
\p
\v 80 The young boy grew and his spirit¦38612 was also strengthened¦38611, and he lived in the wilderness¦38617 until¦38618 he started his ministry to \add the people of\add* Yisrael.

\s1 Yeshua's birth in Bethlehem
\rem /s1 The Birth of Jesus
\r (Mat. 1:18-25)
\p
\v 1 At that time, Caesar¦38634 Augustus¦38635 sent a decree¦38632 that everyone throughout the empire needed to register¦38637 \add in a census\add*.
\v 2 (This census was conducted when Quirinius was the governor¦38650 of Syria¦38652.)
\v 3 Everyone had to \add officially\add* register¦38658 in the city¦38667 where they were \add born\add*.
\p
\v 4 Because Yosef was a descendant of \add King\add* David, he left the town of \nd Nazareth¦38677\nd* in the Galilee¦38674 \add region\add* and¦38669 went¦38668 down to David's town of Bethlehem¦38689 in Yudea¦38681
\v 5 to register¦38699 along with Maria¦38702, his pregnant¦38710 fiancée.
\v 6 While they were in Bethlehem, the time¦38725 came for her¦38735 to give birth
\v 7 and so Maria bore her¦38740 first¦38742 son and wrapped him in strips of cloth and slept him in an \add empty\add* feeding trough, because¦38753 they had missed out on the guest¦38760 room¦38760.
\s1 The shepherds and the messengers
\rem /s1 The Shepherds and the Angels
\p
\v 8 In that same¦38770 area, there were some shepherds¦38762 staying out in the fields¦38772 where they kept watch¦38776 over their¦38782 flocks¦38781 at night¦38778.
\v 9 A messenger¦38785 sent by \nd Yahweh\nd* approached¦38787 them, and \nd Yahweh's\nd* radiance shone around¦38793 them, and they¦38798 were very frightened.
\v 10 “Don't be scared,” the messenger¦38806 told them, “because¦38810 I'm bringing you¦38812 a good¦38811 message¦38811 that¦38815 will bring great¦38814 happiness to all people¦38821
\v 11 because¦38822 a saviour¦38826 for all people was born today¦38825 in David's town. He's the \nd messiah¦38829\nd*, \nd Yahweh¦38830\nd*,
\v 12 and this is how you'll know him: you'll find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and sleeping in a feeding trough.”
\p
\v 13 Then¦38851 suddenly¦38852 lots of heavenly¦38859 soldiers joined the messenger¦38856, praising¦38861 \nd God¦38864\nd* and¦38865 saying¦38866,
\v 14 “Let all honour be given to \nd God¦38870\nd* in the highest¦38869, and¦38871 peace¦38874 on earth¦38873 to all people along with good¦38879 will.”
\p
\v 15 Then¦38880 as the messengers¦38892 left them and¦38907 went¦38883 \add up\add* into the sky, the shepherds¦38897 said to each other, “Well, we'll certainly go into Bethlehem¦38906 so we can see¦38908 what this was about that¦38914 \nd Yahweh¦38916\nd* has let us know about.”
\p
\v 16 So¦38919 they hurried¦38921 \add into town\add* and asked around to find Maria¦38928 and Yosef¦38931, and \add also\add* the baby sleeping in the feeding trough.
\v 17 \add ≈When they met them\add*, they explained what they'd been told about the young baby.
\v 18 Everyone who heard¦38956 this was amazed at what the shepherds¦38965 told them,
\v 19 but¦38969 Maria¦38970 treasured¦38972 all of these¦38976 messages¦38975 in her¦38982 heart¦38980 and \add often\add* thought about them.
\v 20 Finally the shepherds¦38987 returned¦38985 \add back to their fields\add*—they were worshipping and praising¦38990 \nd God¦38992\nd* for what they'd heard¦38996 and how they'd seen it exactly like they'd been told.

\v 26 and¦39123 the \nd spirit¦39132\nd* had told him that he wouldn't die without seeing Yahweh's \nd messiah¦39144\nd*.
\v 27 He had come to the temple¦39153 listening to the \nd spirit¦39150\nd* at just the same time¦39156 as the parents brought in the baby \nd Yeshua\nd* in order to follow the rituals for new parents.
\v 28 Simeon took the baby into his arms and blessed¦39185 \nd God¦39187\nd* and said¦39189,
\v 29 “Now, Yahweh¦39195, you can send your¦39194 slave¦39193 away in peace¦39201 as you promised
\v 30 because¦39202 I've set my¦39206 eyes¦39205 on your¦39209 salvation¦39208

\v 33 The baby's parents were amazed¦39236 at the things being¦39239 spoken¦39239 about him,
\v 34 and Simeon¦39245 blessed¦39243 them and said¦39247 to Maria¦39249, “Listen¦39253, this boy has been chosen to cause both the rise and the fall of many people in Yisrael¦39264, and \add sent as\add* a sign¦39267 but one which many people will oppose.

\p
\v 49 “Why did you all need to look for me?” he answered. “Didn't you both know that it's good for me to be in my¦39610 father's¦39609 house¦39607?”

\v 1 After¦43697 Yeshua had finished sharing those messages¦43707 with the people¦43714, he entered \add the town of\add* Capernaum¦43718.
\v 2 A Roman army commander there had a slave¦43723 that he valued, but who was sick¦43725 and¦43720 expected to die.
\v 3 He had heard¦43735 about¦43737 Yeshua, so he asked the \add local\add* Jewish elders¦43743 to talk to Yeshua on his behalf and¦43736 to ask him to come¦43751 to heal his slave¦43754.
\v 4 When the elders got to \nd Yeshua\nd*, they earnestly¦43766 implored¦43763 him¦43765 saying¦43767, “The man you'd be helping is worth¦43770 it

\p
\v 6 So¦43790 \nd Yeshua\nd* went with them but as they got closer to the house¦43810, the commander had sent¦43811 some friends¦43819 to tell him, “\nd Master¦43823\nd*, don't¦43803 trouble¦43825 yourself because¦43827 I'm not worthy¦43829 enough to have you enter my¦43836 home

\v 11 The next day¦43938, Yeshua went to a town called¦43945 Nain¦43946, and¦43935 his¦43952 followers went with him as well as a large crowd¦43955 of people.

\v 15 The dead¦44028 son sat¦44026 up and started talking¦44031, and Yeshua led him to his¦44038 mother¦44037.

\v 19 and sent¦44109 them to \nd Yeshua\nd* to ask, “Are you¦44119 the promised one, or should we¦44126 wait for someone else?”
\p
\v 20 So¦44129 when they got to Yeshua, the two men¦44133 told him¦44131, “Yohan-the-immerser sent¦44141 us here to ask you if you're the promised one, or should we wait for someone else?”
\p
\v 21 While they were still there, he healed¦44161 many people from their diseases¦44165 and difficulties, as well as evil¦44172 spirits¦44170 and some blind¦44174 people being able to see again,

\v 31 “\wj So¦44401 what can I compare this generation¦44406 with?\wj*” asked Yeshua. “\wj Who are they¦44410 similar¦44411 to?\wj*

\v 36 Another time, someone¦44497 from the Pharisees party invited Yeshua to go to his place for a meal, and so he went there and reclined¦44516 \add on a flat couch\add*.

\v 39 When the Pharisee who had invited¦44592 Yeshua saw this, he said to himself¦44597, “If that man was a prophet¦44603, he'd know who she is and¦44586 what kind of woman¦44610 it is that's touching¦44613 him, because¦44616 she breaks God's laws.”
\p

\p
\v 43 “I suppose¦44681,” answered¦44675 Simon¦44679, “that it was the one who was forgiven the biggest debt.”
\p “\wj You're right,\wj*” said Yeshua.

\v 41 Then¦45897, wow¦45898, a man¦45901 named Yairus¦45907 came¦45899 and knelt down in front of Yeshua. He was the leader at the \add local\add* meeting¦45913 hall¦45913 and he pleaded for Yeshua to come¦45926 to his¦45933 house¦45931
\v 42 because¦45936 his only daughter¦45937, a twelve-year old, was dying¦45947.
\p Then while Yeshua was on his way squeezing through the crowd¦45958,
\v 43 a woman¦45963 who'd had internal bleeding for twelve¦45970 years¦45969 and¦45962 who couldn't be helped \add by any doctor\add*,
\v 44 \add worked her way up\add* behind¦45996 Yeshua and touched¦45997 the edge of his¦46002 robe. Immediately her bleeding stopped¦46005

\p No one owned up, and Peter¦46033 said, “Master¦46040, there's people all around you and they're pressing against¦46026 you.”
\p
\v 46 “\wj Someone¦46061 touched¦46059 me,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* responded¦46058, “\wj because¦46063 I felt power¦46066 going out from me.\wj*”
\v 47 When the woman¦46074 now saw that she wouldn't get away with it, she came¦46081 to Yeshua shaking, and knelt down at his feet. She told him in front of all the people¦46097 why she'd touched¦46088 his \add clothes\add* and how she'd been immediately¦46103 healed¦46102.
\v 48 “\wj \+add ≈Lady\+add*,\wj*” Yeshua said¦46107, “\wj your¦46113 faith¦46112 has healed¦46114 you. Go in peace¦46119.\wj*”
\p
\v 49 While he was still speaking¦46123, someone¦46126 came from the meeting¦46130 hall¦46130 leader's¦46130 \add home\add* and told \add him\add*, “Don't bother the teacher¦46144 any further. Your¦46139 daughter¦46138 just passed away.”
\p
\v 50 But \nd Yeshua\nd* heard¦46148 this and \add turned to Yairus and\add* said, “\wj Don't be afraid. Just believe¦46158 and she'll be healed¦46161.\wj*”
\p
\v 51 So¦46164 they continued to the house¦46167, but Yeshua didn't¦46168 allow¦46170 anyone¦46174 inside other than Peter¦46180 and Yohan and Yacob, along with the girl's parents.
\v 52 Everyone was weeping and¦46198 mourning¦46201 for her, but¦46204 he said¦46205, “\wj Don't cry. She isn't¦46206 dead—just asleep.\wj*”
\p
\v 53 But¦46214 they ridiculed¦46215 Yeshua because they knew that she'd died¦46219.
\v 54 He took hold of her¦46230 hand¦46229, and¦46221 called¦46232, “\wj Girl, get up.\wj*”
\v 55 Then¦46238 her spirit¦46242 returned¦46240 and she got up immediately¦46246, and he told \add <them\add* to give her something¦46251 to eat¦46253.
\v 56 Her¦46259 parents¦46258 were astonished, but he instructed¦46264 them not to tell anyone¦46268 what had happened.

\p
\v 11 Then¦56269 Yeshua went on to tell a parable¦56274 to those who heard all that, because¦56275 he was getting near to Yerushalem and¦56269 they had assumed that God's kingdom¦56294 was going¦56292 appear¦56298 straight away.
\v 12 Because of that, he¦56299 told them, “\wj Once a man¦56302 of high status was going to a distant¦56311 country¦56310 to inherit a kingdom¦56314, and¦56315 then to return¦56316 \+add after that\+add*.\wj*
\v 13 \wj So¦56318 he called¦56317 his ten slaves¦56320 and gave¦56323 them ten silver¦56326 coins and told them to put them to work until he got back.\wj*
\v 14 \wj But his¦56341 citizens¦56340 hated him and sent¦56346 a delegation¦56347 out to him to say, ‘We don't¦56351 want this man¦56353 to reign¦56354 over us.’\wj*
\p
\v 15 “\wj But¦56357 he received¦56363 his¦56362 kingdom¦56365 and then¦56357 he headed back and sent for those slaves¦56372 that he had given¦56376 the silver¦56378 to, to find out how \+add well\+add* they'd traded.\wj*
\v 16 \wj The first¦56389 slave arrived¦56386 and¦56387 said, ‘Master¦56391, I used your¦56394 silver coin to earn ten more coins.’\wj*
\v 17 \wj ‘Well done good¦56408 slave¦56409,’ he¦56404 said¦56404, ‘and¦56402 because you were faithful¦56414 with a little, I'll put you in charge of ten¦56420 cities¦56421.’\wj*
\v 18 \wj Then¦56422 the second¦56425 \+add slave\+add* came and¦56422 said, ‘Your¦56433 silver master¦56434, gained five more coins.’\wj*
\v 19 \wj ‘You too,’ \+add the master\+add* said¦56439, ‘will be put in charge of five¦56450 cities¦56451.’\wj*
\v 20 \wj Then¦56452 another¦56454 \+add slave\+add* came¦56455 and¦56452 said, ‘Master¦56457, look, here's your¦56461 silver¦56460 that¦56462 I kept hidden away wrapped in a handkerchief¦56466\wj*
\v 21 \wj because¦56472 I was scared of you, knowing that you're¦56476 a hard man¦56473—picking up what you didn't put down, and harvesting where you didn't sow.’\wj*
\v 22 \wj ‘I'll judge you by your¦56496 own words,’ \+add the master\+add* said, ‘you evil¦56499 slave¦56500! You knew that I'm a hard man¦56504, picking up what I didn't put down, and harvesting what I didn't sow.\wj*

\v 15 \wj So they threw him \add ≈off the property\add* and¦57348 killed¦57357 him.\wj*

\v 6 When Pilate¦60192 heard¦60195 that, he asked¦60200 if the prisoner was a Galilean¦60207,

\v 32 There were also two¦60729 other¦60726 criminals¦60728 being¦60723 led along to be executed with Yeshua.

\p
\v 36 The soldiers¦60836 also mocked¦60831 him, going up and¦60832 offering¦60842 cheap wine to him,

\p
\v 19 “\wj What happened?\wj*” he asked.
\p “What happened to the man¦61652, \nd Yeshua\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦61648\nd*,” they answered. “He was a prophet¦61653 who did powerful miracles and delivered a powerful message¦61660 in front of \nd God¦61665\nd* and all the people¦61669.
\v 20 The chief¦61678 priests¦61678 and our¦61682 rulers¦61681 handed him over to be sentenced to death¦61685, and he was executed¦61687 on a post.

\v 23 but they couldn't find his¦61740 body¦61739. Then they came¦61741 back and¦61735 told us about some vision¦61744 about messengers¦61745 \add from God\add* who apparently said that he's alive.
\v 24 Some of our companions went¦61752 out to the tomb¦61760 and¦61751 found¦61762 it¦61762 just as the women¦61769 had said¦61770, but they didn't¦61773 see \add anyone\add*.”
\p
\v 25 “\wj Oh, you're so foolish¦61785,\wj*” he told them, “\wj and¦61776 your hearts¦61789 are so reluctant to believe¦61791 everything that¦61790 the prophets¦61797 wrote.\wj*
\v 26 \wj Didn't the \+nd messiah¦61804\+nd* need to suffer¦61802 all of that in order to be able to enter into all his¦61811 greatness?\wj*”
\v 27 Then¦61812 starting with Mosheh¦61816 and¦61812 going through all the prophets¦61821, he explained the scriptures¦61836 to them concerning¦61838 what had been written about him there.

\v 28 As they got close to the village¦61846 they were going to, he seemed¦61852 to be going on further
