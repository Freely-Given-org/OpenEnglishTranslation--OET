\mt2 being the account of Yeshua's ministry
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua was written by Luke, one of the later followers of Yeshua. Luke was believed to be a medical doctor and although many have assumed him to be a Greek, there's also a good case that he was Jewish. He was good friends with Paul and accompanied him several times as they travelled to various places to spread the good message about Yeshua the messiah. Luke was also the author of the account of the beginnings of the Christian church known commonly known as \bk Acts\bk*, and unlike most other Bibles, the \em Open English Translation\em* places these two successive accounts one after the other.
\is2 This account
\ip This account was written to Theophilus who is said to be an honoured person from Rome. He starts his account with the prophesied birth of Yohan-the-immerser and then of Yeshua right through until he's lifted into the clouds. Luke also explains how that Yeshua is the messiah promised by God to save Jews and all non-Jews who put their trust in him.
\ip It's also told here in this document about Yeshua's mercy towards troubled people and sinners, his healing of many who were sick or possessed by demons, his bringing dead people back to life, and his teaching. Recurring themes here include God's spirit, prayer, forgiveness of sins, the women who helped Yeshua with his work, and how believers should prepare for his return.

\s1 Introduction
\rem /s1 Dedication to Theophilus
\p
\v 1 Several people attempted¦37622 to write an account about the events that we're personally certain of
\v 2 as the ones who were eyewitnesses¦37640 and¦37641 hearers of these accounts from the beginning¦37639 handed them over to us.
\v 3 So since we had followed¦37649 all these events so carefully, it¦37647 seemed like a good idea to write¦37655 this account for you¦37654, honoured Theophilus¦37657,
\v 4 so that you could know¦37659 the definite background behind what you were taught.
\s1 The messenger foretells the birth of Yohan-the-immerser
\rem /s1 The Birth of John the Baptist Is Announced; The Birth of John the Baptist Foretold; The coming of Christ
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5: \xt 1Ch 24:10.\x*It started with the priest¦37676 Zechariah and his wife¦37685 Elizabeth at the time when Herod¦37671 was the king¦37673 of Yudea¦37675. (Zechariah was in the priestly division¦37681 of Abijah¦37682, and Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron¦37691.)
\v 6 \nd God¦37705\nd* considered them both good and blameless¦37715 as they¦37698 obeyed his commands¦37710 and regulations.
\v 7 Elizabeth¦37724 had never been able to have a child¦37720, so there was just the two of them as they were now getting older.
\p
\v 8 One time¦37739 as he was taking his rostered turn to serve \nd God¦37751\nd* along with his division¦37746,
\v 9 he was chosen¦37757 by lot (this was how the priests¦37756 assigned tasks) to light the incense¦37760 in the temple¦37764, and so he proceeded inside.
\v 10 A lot of people¦37774 would be praying¦37776 outside¦37777 the temple at the time when the incense¦37781 was burnt.
\v 11 At that moment, a messenger¦37785 from God appeared¦37782 to Zechariah, standing right there at the right of the incense¦37793 altar¦37791.
\v 12 Zechariah¦37796 got a big fright at seeing him there and started to tremble.
\v 13 But the messenger¦37809 spoke, “Don't be scared Zechariah, because¦37814 your request has been listened¦37815 to, and your wife¦37821 Elizabeth¦37823 will give birth to a son and you'll name¦37832 him Yohan¦37834.
\v 14 He'll bring a lot of happiness to you and you'll be proud of him¦37848—in fact many people will be glad.
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15: \xt Num 6:3.\x*He'll be considered special in God's eyes, but he won't¦37863 be allowed to drink¦37864 wine or spirits. Even while he's still¦37869 in his¦37875 mother's¦37874 womb, he'll be filled¦37868 with God's \nd spirit¦37866\nd*.
\v 16 He will turn many children of Yisrael¦37880 back to \nd Yahweh¦37883\nd*, their¦37886 \nd God¦37885\nd*.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17: \xt Mal 4:5-6.\x*And he will go on ahead¦37890 of God with the spirit¦37894 and the power¦37896 of Eliyyah, to turn fathers¦37901 back to loving their children¦37903 and to turn career criminals towards the wisdom of godly people, to get the people ready for \nd Yahweh¦37911\nd*.”
\p
\v 18 Zechariah asked the messenger¦37919, “How will I know if this is true. Because¦37925 I'm an older¦37927 man¦37927 and¦37928 my¦37931 wife¦37930 is also getting old.”
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 1:19: \xt Dan 8:16; 9:21.\x*Now the messenger¦37940 rebuked him¦37942, “I am Gabriel¦37945 who stood¦37947 right in front of \nd God¦37951\nd* and was commanded to come here and talk to you, and to tell all of this to you.
\v 20 So¦37961 hear this: Because you didn't¦37966 believe¦37978 my¦37981 message¦37980, you will be made silent¦37964 and unable to speak¦37968 until¦37969 the day¦37971 that all of these¦37974 things happen, and they certainly will happen at the proper times.”
\p
\v 21 Meanwhile, the people¦37992 outside were expecting¦37994 Zechariah to come back out, and¦37997 were wondering what could be holding him¦38003 up there inside the temple¦38006.
\v 22 But¦38023 when he did emerge, he wasn't able to speak¦38013 to them. They wondering if maybe he'd seen¦38019 a vision¦38018 in the temple¦38022, and he nodded to confirm this although he remained mute.
\v 23 And after he'd finished his¦38040 rostered days¦38037 in the temple, he returned home¦38045.
\p
\v 24 As time went on, Elizabeth¦38056 became pregnant and¦38060 secluded¦38061 herself¦38062 away for five¦38064 months¦38063, saying¦38065,
\v 25 “\nd Yahweh¦38071\nd* has done this for me. At this time he's looked¦38075 down at me and taken away the public shame of my¦38079 being childless.”
\s1 God's messenger comes to Maria
\rem /s1 The Birth of Jesus Foretold; The Birth of Jesus Is Announced
\p
\v 26 When Elizabeth was six months¦38085 pregnant, \nd God¦38096\nd* sent¦38089 his messenger¦38091 Gabriel¦38092 to \nd Nazareth¦38105\nd*, a city¦38098 in the Galilee¦38101 region.
\v 27 \x + \xo 1:27: \xt Mat 1:18.\x*Gabriel went to a young woman named Maria¦38125 who was engaged to be married to Yosef¦38114, a descendant of \add King\add* David¦38119,
\v 28 and entering the room, spoke to her¦38132, “Hello there. \nd Yahweh¦38139\nd* is with you and he's chosen you to be honoured.”
\v 29 Maria was very puzzled by the statement¦38153 and¦38157 wondered what kind of greeting¦38165 it could be
\v 30 as the messenger¦38171 continued, “Don't be scared, Maria¦38177, because¦38180 you¦38179 have found¦38179 God's favour¦38181
\v 31 \x + \xo 1:31: \xt Mat 1:21.\x*and listen, you will conceive¦38187 a baby and go on to give birth to a son, and you should name¦38196 him¦38197 \nd Yeshua¦38198\nd*.
\v 32 \x + \xo 1:32-33: \xt 2Sam 7:12-13,16; Isa 9:7.\x*He will be very special and will be called¦38206 the son of the highest¦38205 one, and \nd Yahweh¦38211 God¦38213\nd* will give him the throne¦38215 of David¦38216, his¦38219 ancestor.
\v 33 He will reign¦38221 over Yacob's¦38225 descendants throughout the ages, and his¦38232 kingdom¦38231 will never end¦38235.”
\p
\v 34 “How would this work,” Maria¦38239 asked the messenger¦38243, “because¦38248 I've never slept with a guy?”
\p
\v 35 “The holy \nd spirit¦38260\nd* will come over you,” answered¦38255 the messenger¦38257, “and the power¦38266 of the highest¦38267 one will overshadow¦38268 you, and so the holy child¦38277 that will be born will be called¦38278 God's son.
\v 36 Also, your¦38287 relative¦38285 Elizabeth¦38283 has also conceived¦38291 a son in her¦38296 old age—the one who was called¦38305 barren¦38306 is now six months¦38300 pregnant
\v 37 \x + \xo 1:37: \xt Gen 18:14.\x*because with \nd God¦38315\nd*, his statements always come to pass.”
\p
\v 38 “Look¦38324 here,” said Maria¦38322, “I'm \nd Yahweh's¦38327\nd* servant girl. May everything you said come true.” Then¦38321 the messenger¦38340 left her.
\s1 Maria's visit to Elizabeth
\rem /s1 Mary Visits Elizabeth
\p
\v 39 Several days¦38348 later, Maria¦38344 determined that she'd go to the town in the hills of Yudea
\v 40 where Zechariah and Elizabeth lived. She entered the house¦38364 and greeted¦38367 Elizabeth,
\v 41 and as soon as Elizabeth¦38381 heard¦38373 the greeting¦38377, her baby in her womb kicked¦38382, and she was filled¦38396 with the holy \nd spirit¦38397\nd*
\v 42 and she¦38403 called out loudly¦38406, “Out of \add all\add* women¦38412, you¦38419 have been blessed and the baby in your¦38419 womb has been blessed.
\v 43 How could this happen to me—that the mother¦38427 of my¦38430 \nd master¦38429\nd* would come¦38425 and visit me!
\v 44 You see¦38434, as soon as I heard your¦38442 greeting¦38441, the baby in my¦38446 womb kicked¦38447 with excitement,
\v 45 and the woman¦38462 who believed¦38463 that everything \nd Yahweh¦38471\nd* told her¦38469 will happen, she will be blessed¦38461.”
\s1 Maria's song of praise
\rem /s1 The Magnificat: Mary's Song of Praise
\p
\v 46 Maria¦38474 said¦38473,
\q1 “My¦38479 soul¦38478 praises \nd Yahweh¦38481\nd*,
\q1
\v 47 and¦38482 my spirit¦38485 is so happy about \nd God¦38490\nd*, my saviour¦38492,
\q1
\v 48 \x + \xo 1:48: \xt 1Sam 1:11.\x*because¦38504 he noticed his¦38502 humble servant girl.
\q1 Look now, all the future generations¦38512 will consider that I was blessed¦38508
\q1
\v 49 because the powerful¦38521 one treated me incredibly,
\q1 and¦38522 his¦38527 name¦38526 is holy.
\q1
\v 50 He shows his¦38531 mercy¦38530 to multiple generations;
\q1 to those who honour him.
\q1
\v 51 His¦38546 arm is powerful¦38543;
\q1 he scatters¦38547 those who are proud¦38548 in their¦38551 hearts¦38550.
\q1
\v 52 \x + \xo 1:52: \xt Yob 5:11; 12:19.\x*He knocks kings off their thrones¦38555,
\q1 and¦38556 praises those who are humble¦38558.
\q1
\v 53 Those who are hungry, he fills with good¦38561 things,
\q1 but those who are rich, he sends away empty¦38565 handed.
\q1
\v 54 He took¦38566 good care of his¦38569 servant¦38568, Yisrael¦38567,
\q1 to be reminded¦38570 of mercy¦38571
\q1
\v 55 \x + \xo 1:55: \xt Gen 17:7.\x*as he spoke¦38573 to our¦38577 ancestors¦38576,
\q1 to Abraham¦38579 and his¦38583 descendants¦38582,
\q1 at the right time.”
\p
\v 56 So¦38590 Maria¦38591 stayed with Elizabeth for about¦38595 three¦38598 months¦38597 before returning¦38600 back to her¦38604 own home¦38603.
\s1 The birth of Yohan-the-immerser
\rem /s1 The Birth of John the Baptist
\p
\v 57 When Elizabeth's nine months were up, she¦38615 gave birth and¦38614 produced a son
\v 58 and her neighbours¦38620 and relatives¦38623 heard¦38618 that \nd Yahweh¦38628\nd* had shown great mercy¦38630 to her, and so they celebrated along with her.
\p
\v 59 \x + \xo 1:59: \xt Lev 12:3.\x*When the baby boy was eight¦38644 days old, it was the time to circumcise¦38647 him, and \add the relatives at the ceremony\add* started calling¦38651 him Zacharias¦38659 after¦38653 the name¦38655 of his¦38658 father¦38657,
\v 60 but¦38667 the baby's mother¦38663 spoke up and said¦38665, “No, he's going to be named Yohan¦38672.”
\p
\v 61 “None of your¦38687 relatives¦38685 have that name¦38692,” they¦38675 said¦38675
\v 62 and they signalled¦38696 to the father¦38699 to tell them what name¦38701 he wanted for the baby.
\p
\v 63 So¦38710 Zacharias requested¦38711 a writing tablet¦38713 and wrote¦38714, “His¦38721 name¦38720 is Yohan¦38716.” Everyone was amazed
\v 64 and then suddenly his¦38737 mouth¦38736 and tongue¦38741 were freed and he was able to speak¦38744 again and started praising \nd God¦38747\nd*.
\v 65 Everyone¦38766 who lived nearby was a bit unnerved by all this, and¦38760 the story about what happened was discussed¦38769 \add in all the homes\add* around¦38757 the hills
\v 66 and those who heard¦38779 about it were thinking to themselves, “Who's this young child¦38792 going to turn out to be?”
\s1 Zacharias' prophecy about Yohan
\rem /s1 Zechariah's Song; Zechariah's Prophecy
\p
\v 67 Then¦38802 the boy's father¦38805, Zacharias¦38803, became filled¦38807 with the holy \nd spirit¦38808\nd* and¦38810 prophesied¦38811,
\q1
\v 68 “Blessed¦38815 is Yisrael's¦38820 \nd God¦38818 Yahweh¦38816\nd*,
\q1 because¦38821 he visited¦38822 us and made a way for his¦38831 people¦38829 to be freed from slavery.
\q1
\v 69 He brought us a voice that would lead to our salvation¦38835,
\q1 us citizens of \add the nation of King\add* David¦38840, his¦38843 servant¦38842
\q1
\v 70 (as he spoke¦38845 via the mouths¦38847 of his¦38856 holy prophets¦38855 through the age\add s\add*).
\q1
\v 71 He saved us from our¦38862 enemies¦38861,
\q1 and from the power of all the ones hating¦38868 us,
\q1
\v 72 to show mercy¦38871 to our¦38875 ancestors¦38874
\q1 and¦38876 to remind¦38877 them of his¦38880 holy agreement,
\q1
\v 73 that he had promised Abraham¦38885, our¦38888 ancestor, that he would give¦38890 us.
\q1
\v 74 He rescued¦38898 us from the power of our enemies¦38896,
\q1 so we could serve him¦38900 without fear,
\q1
\v 75 committed to obeying him¦38906
\q1 for the rest of our¦38915 lives.
\q1
\v 76 \x + \xo 1:76: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*And you too my little¦38919 child¦38919, will be called¦38922 a prophet¦38920 of the highest¦38921 one—
\q1 going¦38923 before \nd Yahweh¦38929\nd* to prepare¦38930 his¦38932 paths,
\q1
\v 77 to give¦38934 knowledge¦38935 about salvation¦38936 to his¦38939 people¦38938
\q1 so their¦38944 sins¦38942 can be forgiven¦38941
\q1
\v 78 because¦38946 \nd God¦38949\nd* has compassion¦38947 on us and mercy¦38948.

\q1 to guide us onto the road of peace¦38975.”
\p
\v 80 The young boy grew and his spirit¦38982 was also strengthened¦38981, and he lived in the wilderness¦38987 until¦38988 he started his ministry to \add the people of\add* Yisrael¦38994.

\r (Mat. 1:18-25)
\p
\v 1 At that time, Caesar¦39004 Augustus¦39005 sent a decree¦39002 that everyone throughout the empire needed to register¦39007 \add in a census\add*.
\v 2 (This census was conducted when Quirinius was the governor¦39020 of Syria¦39022.)
\v 3 Everyone had to \add officially\add* register¦39029 in the city¦39038 where they were \add born\add*.
\p
\v 4 Because Yosef¦39042 was a descendant of \add King\add* David, he left the town of \nd Nazareth¦39048\nd* in the Galilee¦39045 \add region\add* and went¦39039 down to David's town of Bethlehem¦39060 in Yudea¦39052
\v 5 to register¦39070 along with Maria¦39073, his pregnant¦39082 fiancée.
\v 6 While they were in Bethlehem, the time¦39097 came for her¦39107 to give birth
\v 7 and so Maria bore her¦39112 first¦39114 son and wrapped him in strips of cloth and slept him in an \add empty\add* feeding trough, because¦39125 they had missed out on the guest¦39132 room¦39129.
\s1 The shepherds and the messengers
\rem /s1 The Shepherds and the Angels
\p
\v 8 In that same¦39142 area, there were some shepherds¦39134 staying out in the fields¦39144 where they kept watch¦39148 over their¦39154 flocks¦39153 at night¦39150.
\v 9 A messenger¦39157 sent by \nd Yahweh\nd* approached¦39159 them, and \nd Yahweh's\nd* radiance shone around¦39165 them, and they¦39170 were very frightened.
\v 10 “Don't be scared,” the messenger¦39178 told them, “because¦39182 I'm bringing you¦39184 a good¦39183 message¦39183 that will bring great¦39186 happiness to all people¦39193
\v 11 because¦39194 a saviour¦39198 for all people was born today¦39197 in David's town. He's the \nd messiah¦39201\nd*, \nd Yahweh¦39202\nd*,
\v 12 and this is how you'll know him: you'll find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and sleeping in a feeding trough.”
\p
\v 13 Then¦39223 suddenly¦39224 lots of heavenly¦39231 soldiers joined the messenger¦39228, praising¦39233 \nd God¦39236\nd* and¦39237 saying¦39238,
\v 14 “Let all honour be given to \nd God¦39242\nd* in the highest¦39241, and¦39243 peace¦39246 on earth¦39245 to all people along with good¦39251 will.”
\p
\v 15 Then¦39252 as the messengers¦39264 left them and¦39279 went¦39255 \add up\add* into the sky, the shepherds¦39269 said to each other, “Well, we'll certainly go into Bethlehem¦39278 so we can see¦39280 what this was about that \nd Yahweh¦39288\nd* has let us know about.”
\p
\v 16 So¦39291 they hurried¦39294 \add into town\add* and asked around to find Maria¦39302 and Yosef¦39305, and \add also\add* the baby sleeping in the feeding trough.
\v 17 \add ≈When they met them\add*, they explained what they'd been told about the young baby.
\v 18 Everyone who heard¦39330 this was amazed at what the shepherds¦39339 told them,
\v 19 but¦39343 Maria¦39345 treasured¦39347 all of these¦39351 messages¦39350 in her¦39357 heart¦39355 and \add often\add* thought about them.
\v 20 Finally the shepherds¦39362 returned¦39360 \add back to their fields\add*—they were worshipping and praising¦39365 \nd God¦39367\nd* for what they'd heard¦39371 and how they'd seen it exactly like they'd been told.

\v 25 Now listen, there was a man named Simeon¦39479 in Yerushalem¦39475 and he was godly¦39487 and committed, waiting¦39488 for God to rescue Yisrael¦39491. He was \add full\add* of the holy \nd spirit¦39493\nd*
\v 26 and the \nd spirit¦39508\nd* had told him that he wouldn't die without seeing Yahweh's \nd messiah¦39520\nd*.
\v 27 He had come to the temple¦39529 listening to the \nd spirit¦39526\nd* at just the same time¦39532 as the parents brought in the baby \nd Yeshua¦39539\nd* in order to follow the rituals for new parents.
\v 28 Simeon took the baby into his arms and blessed¦39561 \nd God¦39564\nd* and said¦39566,
\v 29 “Now, Yahweh¦39572, you can send your¦39571 slave¦39570 away in peace¦39578 as you promised
\v 30 because¦39579 I've set my¦39583 eyes¦39582 on your¦39586 salvation¦39585
\v 31 which¦39587 you¦39588 have prepared¦39588 in front of everyone:
\v 32 \x + \xo 2:32: \xt Isa 42:6; 49:6; 52:10.\x*a light¦39594 so the non-Jews¦39597 can understand, and the greatest gift from and for your¦39601 people¦39600 of Yisrael¦39602.”
\p
\v 33 The baby's parents were amazed¦39614 at the things being¦39617 spoken¦39617 about him,
\v 34 and Simeon¦39624 blessed¦39621 them and said¦39626 to Maria¦39628, “Listen¦39632, this boy has been chosen to cause both the rise and the fall of many people in Yisrael¦39643, and \add sent as\add* a sign¦39646 but one which many people will oppose.
\v 35 Also even as you¦39649 experience incredible grief in the future, it will allow the thoughts of many hearts¦39662 to be revealed¦39658.”

\v 36 Also there, was a prophetess¦39668 named Hanna¦39667 (the daughter¦39669 of Fanuel from the tribe¦39672 of Asher). She was very elderly, having been married for seven¦39687 years¦39686
\v 37 and then had been widowed¦39695 for eighty-four¦39700 years¦39698. She was always at the temple¦39710, serving¦39718 night¦39719 and day¦39721 in prayer and fasting¦39711.
\v 38 She also approached¦39728 the baby around the same¦39725 time, and praised¦39729 God and spoke about the boy to everyone in Yerushalem¦39742 who was waiting¦39739 for God to free them.

\v 41 \x + \xo 2:41: \xt Exo 12:1-27; Deu 16:1-8.\x*Every year¦39805 Yeshua's family would go down to Yerushalem¦39807 for the Passover celebrations.
\v 42 One time when he was twelve¦39821 years¦39818 old, they went to celebrate the Passover there as usual,
\v 43 and when it was all over and they started on their return¦39849, the lad stayed there in Yerushalem¦39858 but his¦39869 parents¦39867 weren't aware of it.
\v 44 They thought¦39871 he was with others in the group, but¦39872 at the end of the day's hiking when they looked for him among¦39886 the relatives¦39888 and acquaintances¦39893,
\v 45 they couldn't find him, so they returned¦39899 to Yerushalem¦39901 to look for him.
\v 46 It was only after¦39907 three¦39909 days¦39908 that they¦39910 found¦39910 him¦39911 in the temple¦39915, sitting¦39916 with the \add religious\add* teachers¦39920 there—sometimes listening to them, and¦39924 sometimes asking¦39925 them questions.
\v 47 Everyone who had heard the conversations was amazed¦39928 at his¦39940 intelligence¦39936 and¦39937 knowledge.
\v 48 When his parents found him, they were astonished¦39944 and his mother¦39950 asked, “Son, how could you do this to us? Your¦39963 father¦39962 and I have been frantic looking¦39972 for¦39972 you!”
\p
\v 49 “Why did you all need to look for me?” he answered. “Didn't you both know that it's good for me to be in my¦39991 father's¦39990 house¦39988?”
\v 50 But¦39996 they didn't¦39999 really understand¦40000 what he meant.
\p
\v 51 After that, he went¦40007 back to \nd Nazareth¦40013\nd* with them and continued to be obedient to them,
\v 52 \x + \xo 2:52: \xt 1Sam 2:26; Prv 3:4.\x*and so \nd Yeshua¦40037\nd* continued to grow wiser and taller, and in favour¦40047 with both \nd God¦40049\nd* and the people¦40053.

\v 1 It was the fifteenth¦40057 year of the rule of Caesar¦40062 Tiberius¦40061 when Pontius¦40065 Pilate¦40066 was the governor¦40060 of Yudea¦40068 and Herod¦40074 was the ruler of the Galilean¦40073 quarter.

\v 2 Annas¦40100 and Caiaphas¦40102 were the high priests¦40098 \add in Yerushalem\add*, and this was the time when Yohan¦40108 (son of Zechariah) began preaching God's message¦40105 in the wilderness¦40115.

\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4-6: \xt Isa 40:3-5 (LXX).\x*just like the prophet¦40139 Isayah¦40137 had written¦40132:

\v 6 and¦40180 everybody will see God's salvation¦40185.’
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7: \xt Mat 12:34; 23:33.\x*Because of that, he was telling the crowds¦40195 that went out there to be immersed¦40196 by him, “Bunch of snakes! Who warned¦40203 you all to flee from the severe¦40210 anger¦40210 that's coming¦40209?
\v 8 \x + \xo 3:8: \xt Yhn 8:33.\x*So¦40212 then start demonstrating the qualities that show you have actually turned from your disobedience.

\p
\v 10 “What should we¦40280 do then,” the crowds¦40276 asked him¦40274.
\p
\v 11 “If you've got two¦40292 jackets, give one to someone who doesn't have one,” he replied, “and similarly if you've got food.”
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 3:12: \xt Luk 7:29.\x*Even some tax-collectors came¦40304 to be immersed¦40310, and¦40313 they¦40314 asked Yohan, “Teacher¦40318, what should we¦40320 do?”
\p
\v 13 “Don't collect any extra on top of what you've been told to collect,” he said¦40326.
\p
\v 14 “And what about us too,” some soldiers¦40344 inquired.
\p “Don't bully people or falsely¦40366 accuse¦40366 anyone¦40362,” Yohan answered, “and¦40367 be content with your¦40371 wages¦40370.”
\p
\v 15 The people¦40375 were expecting¦40372 that the \nd messiah¦40391\nd* might¦40389 come \add to save them\add* and¦40376 started wondering in their¦40383 minds if maybe it was Yohan¦40386
\v 16 but he explained to them all, “I've been immersing you all in water¦40406, but there's one coming¦40414 who's greater than me, in fact I'm not even worthy¦40425 to unlace his¦40433 sandals¦40431. He will immerse you all with the holy \nd spirit¦40438\nd* and with fire¦40441.
\v 17 He'll hold the winnowing¦40444 fork so he can clear¦40451 out the threshing¦40453 floor¦40453, gathering¦40458 the wheat¦40461 into his¦40448 barn and burning¦40471 up the chaff¦40469 with a fire¦40472 that never goes out.”
\p
\v 18 Yohan preached¦40481 the good¦40481 message¦40481 to the people¦40484 and also encouraged them to change for the better.

\v 3 So¦40846 the devil¦40849 told him¦40847, “If you're¦40852 God's son, just turn this stone¦40859 into bread¦40865.”

\p
\v 1 After¦44117 Yeshua had finished sharing those messages¦44127 with the people¦44134, he entered \add the town of\add* Capernaum¦44138.
\v 2 A Roman army commander there had a slave¦44143 that he valued, but who was sick¦44145 and expected to die.
\v 3 He had heard¦44156 about¦44158 Yeshua, so he asked the \add local\add* Jewish elders¦44164 to talk to Yeshua on his behalf and to ask him to come¦44172 to heal his slave¦44175.
\v 4 When the elders got to \nd Yeshua¦44182\nd*, they earnestly¦44187 implored¦44184 him¦44186 saying¦44188, “The man you'd be helping is worth¦44191 it
\v 5 because¦44199 he loves us Jews and he built¦44208 the \add local\add* meeting¦44205 hall¦44205 for us.”
\p
\v 6 So¦44212 \nd Yeshua¦44213\nd* went with them but as they got closer to the house¦44232, the commander had sent¦44233 some friends¦44242 to tell him, “\nd Master¦44246\nd*, don't¦44225 trouble¦44248 yourself because¦44250 I'm not worthy¦44252 enough to have you enter my¦44259 home
\v 7 and that's why I never came to you¦44266 personally. However, just issue a command and then my¦44277 boy will be healed¦44274
\v 8 because¦44279 I'm appointed¦44285 under authority¦44284 and have other¦44298 soldiers¦44289 under me. When I tell one of them to go, he goes, and when I tell one to come, he comes, and when I tell my¦44305 slave¦44304 to do something, he does it.”

\v 11 The next day¦44361, Yeshua went to a town called¦44368 Nain¦44369, and his¦44375 followers went with him as well as a large crowd¦44378 of people.
\v 12 As he got near the town gate, look, a dead boy was being¦44392 carried¦44392 out \add to the cemetery\add*. The mother¦44398 was now a widow¦44403 and he had been their only son, and a large number of the local residents were with her.
\v 13 When he saw her, the \nd master¦44421\nd* felt sorry for her and said¦44427, “\wj Don't cry.\wj*”
\v 14 Then he went up closer and touched¦44433 the coffin¦44435, and the pallbearers stopped¦44439. Then he spoke, “\wj Young¦44442 man¦44442, I'm talking¦44444 to you: get up.\wj*”
\v 15 The dead¦44450 son sat¦44448 up and started talking¦44453, and Yeshua led him to his¦44460 mother¦44459.
\v 16 Everyone felt a bit apprehensive and they¦44467 praised¦44467 God saying¦44470, “A powerful prophet¦44472 appeared among¦44477 us,” and “God has been here with his¦44486 people¦44485.”

\v 18 The apprentices of Yohan-the-immerser reported¦44509 all these¦44521 things back to him and he choose two¦44525 of his¦44518 apprentices
\v 19 and sent¦44532 them to \nd Yeshua¦44536\nd* to ask, “Are you¦44542 the promised one, or should we¦44549 wait for someone else?”
\p
\v 20 So¦44552 when they got to Yeshua, the two men¦44556 told him¦44554, “Yohan-the-immerser sent¦44565 us here to ask you if you're the promised one, or should we wait for someone else?”
\p
\v 21 While they were still there, he healed¦44585 many people from their diseases¦44589 and difficulties, as well as evil¦44596 spirits¦44594 and some blind¦44598 people being able to see again,

\p
\v 31 “\wj So¦44826 what can I compare this generation¦44831 with?\wj*” asked Yeshua. “\wj Who are they¦44835 similar¦44836 to?\wj*

\v 36 Another time, someone¦44924 from the Pharisees party invited Yeshua to go to his place for a meal, and so he went there and reclined¦44943 \add on a flat couch\add*.

\v 38 She stood¦44974 weeping¦44983 behind¦44975 Yeshua's feet, wetting¦44987 his feet with her tears. Then she used her hair¦44996 to wipe off the tears and kissed his feet and \add rubbed\add* the lotion into them.
\v 39 When the Pharisee¦45015 who had invited¦45019 Yeshua saw this, he said to himself¦45024, “If that man was a prophet¦45030, he'd know who she is and what kind of woman¦45038 it is that's touching¦45041 him, because¦45044 she breaks God's laws.”
\p
\v 40 “Simon¦45055,” \nd Yeshua¦45051\nd* asked him, “I need to tell you something¦45058.”

\p
\v 41 \add Then Yeshua told him this story:\add* “\wj Once there were two¦45073 people who had borrowed from a money¦45076 lender: one borrowed five-hundred coins¦45081 and¦45084 the other¦45085 borrowed fifty¦45087.\wj*

\p
\v 43 “I suppose¦45112,” answered¦45106 Simon¦45110, “that it was the one who was forgiven the biggest debt.”
\p “\wj You're right,\wj*” said Yeshua.
\v 44 Then¦45127 looking at the woman he said to Simon¦45134, “\wj You see this woman? I came into your¦45141 house¦45145 but you didn't¦45157 give me any water¦45148 to wash my feet, yet she wet my feet with her tears¦45163 and then wiped¦45174 them off with her hair¦45170.\wj*

\v 5 “\wj \+add One day\+add* a \+add farmer\+add* went¦45374 out to plant some seeds. As he spread the seeds, some of them fell along¦45392 the path where they got trampled¦45396 on, and the birds¦45399 ate them.\wj*

\v 41 Then¦46341, wow¦46342, a man¦46345 named Yairus¦46351 came¦46343 and knelt down in front of Yeshua. He was the leader at the \add local\add* meeting¦46357 hall¦46357 and he pleaded for Yeshua to come¦46370 to his¦46377 house¦46375
\v 42 because¦46380 his only daughter¦46381, a twelve-year¦46388 old, was dying¦46391.
\p Then while Yeshua was on his way squeezing through the crowd¦46402,
\v 43 a woman¦46407 who'd had internal bleeding for twelve¦46414 years¦46413 and who couldn't be helped \add by any doctor\add*,
\v 44 \add worked her way up\add* behind¦46440 Yeshua and touched¦46441 the edge of his¦46446 robe. Immediately her bleeding stopped¦46449
\v 45 and \nd Yeshua¦46459\nd* \add stopped and\add* said, “\wj Who touched¦46469 me?\wj*”
\p No one owned up, and Peter¦46477 said, “Master¦46484, there's people all around you and they're pressing against¦46470 you.”
\p
\v 46 “\wj Someone¦46505 touched¦46503 me,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦46501\nd* responded¦46502, “\wj because¦46507 I felt power¦46510 going out from me.\wj*”
\v 47 When¦46516 the woman¦46518 now saw that she wouldn't get away with it, she came¦46525 to Yeshua shaking, and knelt down at his feet. She told him in front of all the people¦46541 why she'd touched¦46532 his \add clothes\add* and how she'd been immediately¦46547 healed¦46546.
\v 48 “\wj \+add ≈Lady¦46554\+add*,\wj*” Yeshua said¦46551, “\wj your¦46558 faith¦46557 has healed¦46559 you. Go in peace¦46564.\wj*”
\p
\v 49 While he was still speaking¦46568, someone¦46571 came from the meeting¦46575 hall¦46575 leader's¦46575 \add home\add* and told \add him\add*, “Don't bother the teacher¦46589 any further. Your¦46584 daughter¦46583 just passed away.”
\p
\v 50 But \nd Yeshua¦46592\nd* heard¦46593 this and \add turned to Yairus and\add* said, “\wj Don't be afraid. Just believe¦46603 and she'll be healed¦46606.\wj*”
\p
\v 51 So¦46609 they continued to the house¦46612, but Yeshua didn't¦46613 allow¦46615 anyone¦46619 inside other than Peter¦46625 and Yohan¦46627 and Yacob¦46630, along with the girl's parents.
\v 52 Everyone was weeping and mourning¦46646 for her, but¦46643 he said¦46650, “\wj Don't cry. She isn't¦46651 dead—just asleep.\wj*”
\p
\v 53 But¦46659 they ridiculed¦46660 Yeshua because they knew that she'd died¦46665.
\v 54 He took hold of her¦46676 hand¦46675, and called¦46678, “\wj Girl, get up.\wj*”
\v 55 Then¦46684 her spirit¦46688 returned¦46686 and she got up immediately¦46692, and he told \add <them\add* to give her something¦46697 to eat¦46699.
\v 56 Her¦46705 parents¦46704 were astonished, but he instructed¦46710 them not to tell anyone¦46714 what had happened.

\v 14 \wj But when the tenants¦57848 saw the son, they reasoned¦57849 among themselves, ‘This is the heir. If we kill¦57860 him, then \+add his\+add* inheritance¦57868 will become¦57866 ours.’\wj*
\v 15 \wj So they threw him out \+add the gate\+add* and killed¦57878 him.\wj*
\p \wj So then, what will the master¦57884 of the vineyard do to them?\wj*
\v 16 \wj He will go \+add to the vineyard\+add* and destroy¦57889 those tenant¦57891 farmers¦57891, and will \+add lease\+add* the vineyard out to others¦57898.\wj*”

\v 9 and asked him lots of questions, but Yeshua didn't answer¦60837 any of them.
\v 10 Meanwhile the chief¦60845 priests¦60845 and¦60846 the religious¦60848 teachers¦60848 were standing there loudly making many accusations¦60850 against¦60851 him¦60851.

\v 13 So¦60911 Pilate¦60910 called¦60913 together¦60913 the chief¦60916 priests¦60916 and the local leaders and the people¦60923
\v 14 and told them, “You brought¦60928 this man to me for stirring up the people¦60936, but listen, I've examined¦60945 him in front of you all and I find him to be not guilty¦60952 of anything that you're all accusing¦60956 him of,

\v 21 but¦61046 they kept yelling, “Execute him on a stake! Execute him on a stake!”
\p
\v 22 He tried a third¦61059 time, “But¦61058 what crime has this man¦61067 committed? I've found¦61073 nothing worthy of the death¦61072 sentence, so I'll discipline¦61077 him and then release him.”
\p

\v 32 There were also two¦61283 other¦61280 criminals¦61282 being¦61277 led along to be executed with Yeshua.

\p
\v 36 The soldiers¦61392 also mocked¦61387 him, going up and offering¦61398 cheap wine to him,

\v 15 After talking and debating¦62126 for a while, \nd Yeshua¦62131\nd* \add caught up with\add* them and joined them,
\v 16 but¦62137 their¦62139 eyes¦62138 were restricted¦62140 from being¦62140 able to recognise him¦62144.
\v 17 He asked them, “\wj What's¦62151 all this that you two are talking about while you walk¦62160?\wj*”
\p They stopped \add suddenly\add* and looked at him with sad faces,
\v 18 and the one called Cleopas¦62172 asked him¦62175, “Are you the only visitor staying in Yerushalem¦62181 who doesn't know what just happened in the last few days¦62193?”
\p
\v 19 “\wj What happened?\wj*” he asked.
\p “What happened to the man¦62217, \nd Yeshua¦62211\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦62213\nd*,” they answered. “He was a prophet¦62218 who did powerful miracles and delivered a powerful message¦62225 in front of \nd God¦62230\nd* and all the people¦62234.
\v 20 The chief¦62243 priests¦62243 and our¦62247 rulers¦62246 handed him over to be sentenced to death¦62250, and he was executed¦62252 on a stake¦62252.

\v 22 Then some of our women¦62288 also surprised us, because they went to his tomb¦62300 \add very\add* early¦62296 \add this morning\add*
\v 23 but they couldn't find his¦62306 body¦62305. Then they came¦62308 back and¦62301 told us about some vision¦62311 about messengers¦62312 \add from God\add* who apparently said that he's alive.
\v 24 Some of our companions went¦62319 out to the tomb¦62328 and found¦62330 it¦62330 just as the women¦62337 had said¦62338, but they didn't¦62341 see \add anyone\add*.”
\p
\v 25 “\wj Oh, you're so foolish¦62353,\wj*” he told them, “\wj and your hearts¦62357 are so reluctant to believe¦62359 everything that the prophets¦62365 wrote.\wj*
\v 26 \wj Didn't the \+nd messiah¦62372\+nd* need to suffer¦62370 all of that in order to be able to enter into all his¦62379 greatness?\wj*”
\v 27 Then¦62380 starting with Mosheh¦62384 and going through all the prophets¦62389, he explained the scriptures¦62404 to them concerning¦62406 what had been written about him there.
\p
\v 28 As they got close to the village¦62414 they were going to, he seemed¦62420 to be going on further

\p
\v 33 That very hour¦62534 they \add packed up and\add* headed back to Yerushalem¦62537 where they found¦62539 that the eleven¦62543 and the others with them had gathered¦62540 together
