\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This letter was written by Yudas the younger brother of Yacob. (Note that he wasn't the Yudas who handed Yeshua over to the Jewish religious leaders. Note also that Yudas is mistakenly called Yude in most English Bibles, and Yacob is quite wrongly called James in most English Bibles.)
\is2 This letter
\ip We don't know which group of believers that this letter was sent to. Here in this letter, Yudas warns the believers about teachers of false doctrines who teach that it's okay for believers to continue sinning since they'll just be forgiven due to God's mercy. That's the reason Yudas wrote this, to warn the believers so that they won't fall for false beliefs, but instead will continue to follow the true teaching that came from God. He also encourages the readers that it's necessary to strive to continue in their faith in God along with turning away from evil actions.

It's written to all those who have been called¦154750 and loved¦154742 by \nd God¦154740\nd* the father¦154741 and who have kept¦154749 \add believing\add* in Yeshua the messiah.

\s1 The judgement of false-teachers and god-rejecters
\rem /s1 Occasion of the Letter; The Danger of False Teachers; The sin and doom of Godless men
\p
\v 3 Friends, I was so enthusiastic to write to you concerning¦154766 our¦154769 salvation¦154770 that we have in common¦154768, but I needed to write to you all, encouraging you to stand strong for the teaching that was entrusted to the believers at a certain point in time.
\v 4 Because¦154790 some people¦154792 have quietly come into \add our groups\add* who think they can take advantage of God's grace¦154807 to bring in immoral lifestyles and disowning¦154824 the only master, and our boss who's \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦154822\nd*. But they are destined for judgement¦154800.
\rem /s1 Judgment on False Teachers
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 5: a \xt Exo 12:51; \xo b \xt Num 14:29-30.\x*Now I want to remind¦154826 you that although you all know how \nd Yeshua\nd* rescued our people¦154845 out of Egypt¦154848, yet \add at the same time\add* he destroyed¦154855 the ones who didn't¦154853 believe¦154854.
\v 6 Even the messengers¦154856 who broke their own rules and¦154858 left their own domain have been held in eternal¦154876 chains in the darkness¦154878 until the time of judgement¦154872 in the great¦154873 day¦154874.
\v 7 \x + \xo 7: \xt Gen 19:1-24.\x*Similarly Sodom¦154881 and Amorah \add (Gomorrah¦154883)\add* and the towns around¦154886 them stay in our minds as an example¦154904 of the judgement of eternal¦154906 fire¦154905 due to similar¦154890 sexual perversions.
\p
\v 8 in the same way these¦154918 dreamers¦154919 defile¦154922 their own bodies while rejecting¦154926 authority and dishonouring those who should be honoured.
\v 9 \x + \xo 9: a \xt Dan 10:13,21; 12:1; Rev 12:7; \xo b \xt Deu 34:6; \xo c \xt Zech 3:2.\x*Even Michael¦154934, \add one of\add* the top messengers, when he was arguing with the devil¦154940 about¦154943 Mosheh's body¦154946, he didn't¦154947 belittle him, but¦154933 left it to \nd Yahweh¦154959\nd* to punish him.
\v 10 But these people mock what they don't¦154964 even grasp, but¦154961 they'll be destroyed by what their animal¦154973 instincts do understand¦154974.
\v 11 Oh dear! Because¦154981 they've followed the actions of Cain¦154985\x + \xo 11: \xt Gen 4:3-8; 1Yhn 3:12.\x* and have embraced the deception¦154989 of Balaam¦154992\x + \xo 11: \xt Num 22–24; 31:16; 2Pe 2:15-16.\x* for monetary gain, so too they'll perish¦155000 like Korah's destruction.\x + \xo 11: \xt Num 16:1-35.\x*
\v 12 These¦155001 are the people who ruin your¦155015 love¦155013 feasts¦155013 when they eat without shame and only look after themselves¦155023. They're like clouds¦155025 that are blown away by the wind without bringing the needed rain or trees¦155034 that don't produce any fruit then are doubly useless by falling over;
\v 13 like wild waves¦155042 in the ocean that foam in their own shame¦155051 or like \add unreliable \add* wandering¦155053 stars¦155052 that are already doomed to the darkest darkness in the next age.
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 14: \xt Gen 5:18,21-24.\x*Enoch¦155071 (the seventh¦155068 generation from Adam¦155070) prophesied¦155064 \add way back then¦155065\add* about these¦155067 people, “Look¦155073, \nd Yahweh¦155076\nd*, surrounded by tens of thousands¦155081 of his¦155085 holy \add messengers\add*, came¦155074
\v 15 to sentence everybody and to punish everyone who rejected God for everything they did that¦155105 demonstrated this rejection and everything they said against him¦155117.”
\v 16 This includes their grumbling¦155122 and complaining¦155123, the fulfilling of their own lustful desires, the arrogant¦155137 way that they spoke, and their flattering of others in order to gain from them.

\v 17 \nd But\nd* you¦155142, friends, always be thinking about how the missionaries of our¦155157 \nd master¦155156 Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦155159\nd*
\v 18 \x + \xo 18: \xt 2Pe 3:3.\x*told you¦155162 that mockers¦155173 near the end of time¦155169 would come out following¦155180 their own god-rejecting lusts¦155178.
\v 19 These¦155183 people will cause division as they just demonstrate sensuality since they don't¦155190 know \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦155189\nd*.
\v 20 But you, friends, work to increase your¦155203 faith¦155204 in God, praying¦155211 as the holy \nd spirit¦155209\nd* helps you.
\v 21 Keep receiving God's love¦155216 as you look forward to living forever thanks to the mercy¦155222 of our¦155227 \nd master¦155224\nd*, \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦155229\nd*.
\p
\v 22 Show grace to those \add still\add* doubting¦155242
\v 23 whereas others¦155244 need to be ‘snatched¦155251 out of the fire¦155250’ in order to be saved. To some, show mercy¦155254 but very carefully, hating¦155257 even their clothes¦155265 which reflect their crude lifestyles.
\s1 Honouring God
\rem /s1 Doxology; Benediction; A Prayer of Praise
\p
\v 24-25 Our master, Yeshua the messiah, is the infallible¦155274 one who is quite capable of looking after all of us so that we can stand¦155279 blameless¦155287 in front¦155280 of him and praise him in his full honour and greatness. Let us honour and praise our only God and saviour, acknowledging his greatness and power and authority through Yeshua from before the creation, right through these current times, and in the age to come. May it be so.
