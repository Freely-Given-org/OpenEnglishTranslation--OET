\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This letter was written by Yudas the younger brother of Yacob. (Note that he wasn't the Yudas who handed Yeshua over to the Jewish religious leaders. Note also that Yudas is mistakenly called Yude in most English Bibles, and Yacob is quite wrongly called James in most English Bibles.)
\is2 This letter
\ip We don't know which group of believers that this letter was sent to. Here in this letter, Yudas warns the believers about teachers of false doctrines who teach that it's okay for believers to continue sinning since they'll just be forgiven due to God's mercy. That's the reason Yudas wrote this, to warn the believers so that they won't fall for false beliefs, but instead will continue to follow the true teaching that came from God. He also encourages the readers that it's necessary to strive to continue in their faith in God along with turning away from evil actions.

It's written to all those who have been called¦155757 and loved¦155749 by \nd God¦155747\nd* the father¦155748 and who have kept¦155756 \add believing\add* in Yeshua the messiah.

\s1 The judgement of false-teachers and god-rejecters
\rem /s1 Occasion of the Letter; The Danger of False Teachers; The sin and doom of Godless men
\p
\v 3 Friends, I was so enthusiastic to write to you concerning¦155773 our¦155776 salvation¦155777 that we have in common¦155775, but I needed to write to you all, encouraging you to stand strong for the teaching that was entrusted to the believers at a certain point in time.
\v 4 Because¦155797 some people¦155799 have quietly come into \add our groups\add* who think they can take advantage of God's grace¦155815 to bring in immoral lifestyles and disowning¦155832 the only master, and our boss who's \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦155830\nd*. But they are destined for judgement¦155807.
\rem /s1 Judgment on False Teachers
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 5: a \xt Exo 12:51; \xo b \xt Num 14:29-30.\x*Now I want to remind¦155834 you that although you all know how \nd Yeshua\nd* rescued our people¦155853 out of Egypt¦155856, yet \add at the same time\add* he destroyed¦155863 the ones who didn't¦155861 believe¦155862.
\v 6 Even the messengers¦155864 who broke their own rules and left their own domain have been held in eternal¦155883 chains in the darkness¦155885 until the time of judgement¦155879 in the great¦155880 day¦155881.
\v 7 \x + \xo 7: \xt Gen 19:1-24.\x*Similarly Sodom¦155888 and Gomorrah¦155890 and the towns around¦155893 them stay in our minds as an example¦155911 of the judgement of eternal¦155913 fire¦155912 due to similar¦155897 sexual perversions.
\p
\v 8 in the same way these¦155925 dreamers¦155926 defile¦155929 their own bodies while rejecting¦155933 authority¦155930 and dishonouring those who should be honoured.
\v 9 \x + \xo 9: a \xt Dan 10:13,21; 12:1; Rev 12:7; \xo b \xt Deu 34:6; \xo c \xt Zech 3:2.\x*Even Michael¦155941, \add one of\add* the top messengers, when he was arguing with the devil¦155948 about¦155951 Mosheh's body¦155954, he didn't¦155955 belittle him, but¦155940 left it to \nd Yahweh¦155967\nd* to punish him.
\v 10 But these people mock what they don't¦155972 even grasp, but¦155969 they'll be destroyed by what their animal¦155981 instincts do understand¦155982.
\v 11 Oh dear! Because¦155989 they've followed the actions of Cain¦155993\x + \xo 11: \xt Gen 4:3-8; 1Yhn 3:12.\x* and have embraced the deception¦155997 of Balaam¦156000\x + \xo 11: \xt Num 22–24; 31:16; 2Pe 2:15-16.\x* for monetary gain, so too they'll perish¦156008 like Korah's destruction.\x + \xo 11: \xt Num 16:1-35.\x*
\v 12 These¦156009 are the people who ruin your¦156023 love¦156021 feasts¦156021 when they eat without shame and only look after themselves¦156031. They're like clouds¦156033 that are blown away by the wind without bringing the needed rain or trees¦156042 that don't produce any fruit then are doubly useless by falling over;
\v 13 like wild waves¦156050 in the ocean that foam in their own shame¦156058 or like \add unreliable \add* wandering¦156060 stars¦156059 that are already doomed to the darkest darkness in the next age.
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 14: \xt Gen 5:18,21-24.\x*Enoch¦156080 (the seventh¦156077 generation from Adam¦156079) prophesied¦156073 \add way back then\add* about these¦156076 people, “Look¦156082, \nd Yahweh¦156085\nd*, surrounded by tens of thousands¦156090 of his¦156094 holy \add messengers\add*, came¦156083
\v 15 to sentence everybody and to punish everyone who rejected God for everything they did that demonstrated this rejection and everything they said against him¦156126.”
\v 16 This includes their grumbling¦156131 and complaining¦156132, the fulfilling of their own lustful desires, the arrogant¦156146 way that they spoke, and their flattering of others in order to gain from them.

\v 17 \nd But\nd* you¦156151, friends, always be thinking about how the missionaries of our¦156166 \nd master¦156165 Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦156168\nd*
\v 18 \x + \xo 18: \xt 2Pe 3:3.\x*told you¦156171 that mockers¦156182 near the end of time¦156178 would come out following¦156189 their own god-rejecting lusts¦156187.
\v 19 These¦156192 people will cause division as they just demonstrate sensuality since they don't¦156199 know \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦156198\nd*.
\v 20 But you, friends, work to increase your¦156212 faith¦156213 in God, praying¦156220 as the holy \nd spirit¦156218\nd* helps you.
\v 21 Keep receiving God's love¦156225 as you look forward to living forever thanks to the mercy¦156231 of our¦156236 \nd master¦156233\nd*, \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦156238\nd*.
\p
\v 22 Show grace to those \add still\add* doubting¦156252
\v 23 whereas others¦156254 need to be ‘snatched¦156261 out of the fire¦156260’ in order to be saved. To some, show mercy¦156264 but very carefully, hating¦156268 even their clothes¦156276 which reflect their crude lifestyles.
\s1 Honouring God
\rem /s1 Doxology; Benediction; A Prayer of Praise
\p
\v 24-25 Our master, Yeshua the messiah, is the infallible¦156285 one who is quite capable of looking after all of us so that we can stand¦156290 blameless¦156298 in front¦156291 of him and praise him in his full honour and greatness. Let us honour and praise our only God and saviour, acknowledging his greatness and power and authority through Yeshua from before the creation, right through these current times, and in the age to come. May it be so.
