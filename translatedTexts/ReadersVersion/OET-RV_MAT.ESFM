\mt2 The account of Yeshua's ministry by
\mt1 Matthew
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip The writer of this document was Matthaios, known in English as Matthew and in Hebrew as Levi. He was one of Yeshua's twelve apprentices, and named by Alfaeus his father. He was from Galilee but worked in Capernaum as a tax-collector before he left that to follow Yeshua. It's possible that it was Yeshua who changed his name from Levi when he became a follower, and named him Matthew which means ‘the gift of God’ in Hebrew.
\is2 This account
\ip Matthew's account starts by listing the ancestors of Yeshua, and then describes his birth, his immersion in water, and his temptation by the devil. He tells us about a lot of his preaching and teaching, and about how he healed many sick people in the Galilee region. After that, Matthew goes on to describe Yeshua's trip to Yerushalem and what happened to him there. Then he explains what happened in Yeshua's final week in Yerushalem, his execution on a stake, and his coming back to life.
\ip This document tells how Yeshua is the messiah, promised by God to save the Jews, and all non-Jews who place their trust in him. So by means of him, God fulfills his promises to his people that were listed in the Old Testament.
\ip This good message reveals Yeshua as the great teacher to explain God's law. Here in this document, Matthew records five lengthy teaching sessions about God's kingdom: (1) The preaching on the hill about people's behaviour, their responsibilities, and what they might expect to receive in God's kingdom (chapters 5–7); (2) warning the twelve apprentices about their works (chapter 10); (3) the parables about God's kingdom (chapter 13); (4) the teaching concerning the way to become a follower (chapter 18); and (5) the teaching concerning the end of this age and God's kingdom which is coming. (chapters 24–25).

\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18: \xt Luk 1:27.\x*Now this is how the birth¦290 of \nd Yeshua\nd* came about: Maria¦299 his¦298 mother¦297 was engaged to Yosef. But¦285 before¦302 they came together¦304, she¦306 was found¦306 to be pregnant through \add the work of\add* the holy \nd spirit¦311\nd*.
\v 19 But¦314 Yosef, her husband¦316 \add to be\add*, was a good man, and¦314 not wishing to disgrace Maria, he decided to quietly divorce her.
\v 20 But as he was pondering this, one of Yahweh's messengers¦335 appeared¦340 to him in a dream¦339 and told him, “Yosef, descendant of \add King\add* David¦345, don't¦346 be afraid¦347 to marry Maria¦349, because¦354 the baby in her has been conceived by the holy \nd spirit¦359\nd*.

\p
\v 22 Now all this happened in fulfilment¦387 of what \nd Yahweh¦392\nd* had said through¦393 the prophet¦396,
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Isa 7:14 (LXX).\x*“Listen¦398, the virgin¦400 will get pregnant and she'll have a son, and they'll call him¦412 Immanuel \add (in Hebrew)\add* which¦414 means ‘\nd God¦420\nd* with us.’ ”
\p

\v 25 \x + \xo 1:25: \xt Luk 2:21.\x*but he didn't¦443 sleep with her until¦447 after she gave birth. And Yosef named the boy \nd Yeshua\nd*.

\p
\v 1 After \nd Yeshua\nd* had been born in Bethlehem¦466 in the province of Yudea¦468 during the time of King Herod¦471, watchers of signs arrived¦478 in Yerushalem from the east
\v 2 and asked, “Where's¦482 the one born as king¦486 of the Jews? We saw¦489 his¦491 star¦493 in the east and we came¦498 to worship him.”
\p
\v 3 Now when King Herod¦506 heard¦501 this, he was upset—and¦508 all of Yerushalem as well.
\v 4 He gathered¦514 together¦514 all the chief¦517 priests¦517 and religious¦519 teachers¦519 and asked them where¦525 the \nd Messiah¦527\nd* was expected to be born.
\p
\v 5 And they¦529 told him¦532, “It'll be in Bethlehem¦534 in Yudea¦536, because¦538 the prophet¦542 wrote¦539:\x + \xo 2:5-6: \xt Mic 5:2.\x*
\q1
\v 6 ‘You, Bethlehem¦545 in the land of Yudah¦549,
\q2 are not the most insignificant of the leaders of Yudah,
\q1 because¦563 a leader will come from you
\q2 who will guide my¦571 people¦570 Yisrael.’ ”
\p
\v 7 Then Herod¦575 sent for the watchers of signs and met secretly¦576 with them to determine when the star¦588 had first appeared¦587.
\v 8 Then¦589 he sent¦590 them on to Bethlehem¦593 with these instructions: “Go on and carefully investigate about the child¦602, and when you find him, report¦609 back to me so that I can also come¦613 and worship him.”
\p
\v 9 So¦617 when the king¦621 had finished speaking, they departed, and the star¦626 which they could see¦624 in the east went ahead of them and stopped above the place where¦640 the child¦644 was.
\v 10 Seeing this, the watchers of signs were very happy indeed.
\v 11 As they entered the house¦658, they saw¦659 the child¦663 with his¦669 mother¦668 Maria¦666. They bowed low and worshipped him, then¦654 they opened¦675 their¦678 chests and presented gifts¦681 of gold¦682, frankincense¦684, and myrrh¦686.
\p
\v 12 But¦687 because they'd been warned¦688 in a dream¦690 not to return¦692 to King Herod¦694, they went home again to their¦703 own country¦702.

\p
\v 13 After they'd departed, one of \nd Yahweh's\nd* messengers¦714 appeared¦716 to Yosef in a dream¦718 and said, “Get up and take the child and his¦735 mother¦734 and flee to Egypt¦739 \add (Mitsrayim)\add*. Remain there¦742 until¦743 I tell you, because¦749 \add King\add* Herod¦750 will soon search for the child in order to kill¦757 him.”
\p
\v 14 So¦761 Yosef got up during the night¦773 and took¦764 the child¦767 and his¦772 mother¦771 and departed for Egypt¦777.
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Hos 11:1.\x*They stayed there¦780 until¦781 the death¦783 of Herod¦784, in order¦785 to fulfil¦786 what \nd Yahweh¦791\nd* had said through¦792 the prophet¦794 \add Hoshea\add*: “I called¦798 my¦801 son out of Egypt¦797.”

\v 16 When \add King\add* Herod¦803 realised that he'd been tricked by the watchers of signs, he got very angry and gave orders that all the sons in Bethlehem¦820 and its¦826 districts that were two¦829 years old and younger be killed¦814, because that was the period that he'd found out from the watchers of signs.
\p
\v 17 That fulfilled¦843 what had been spoken¦845 through¦848 the prophet¦851 Jeremiah, who said:
\q1
\v 18 \x + \xo 2:18: \xt Jer 31:15.\x*The sound of great¦862 weeping and mourning¦861 was heard¦856 in Ramah;

\p
\v 19 After \add King\add* Herod¦879 died¦876, one of \nd Yahweh's\nd* messengers¦881 appeared¦883 to Yosef in Egypt¦890 in a dream¦885
\v 20 and said, “Get up and take the child and his¦901 mother¦900 and go \add back\add* to the land of Yisrael, because¦908 the ones wanting to kill him have died.”
\v 21 So¦917 Yosef got up and took¦920 the child¦923 and his¦928 mother¦927 and went¦930 \add back\add* to Yisrael.
\p
\v 22 But when he heard¦936 that Archelaus¦939 was reigning¦940 over Yudea instead¦944 of his¦948 father¦947 Herod¦949, and \add also\add* having been warned¦953 in a dream¦956, he left \add Yudea\add* and went to the Galilee¦962 area.

\v 65 “Well you all guard¦21168 it,” answered Pilate¦21165, “and¦21162 keep it secure¦21170 as you say.”
\p
\v 66 So¦21175 they¦21174 went and secured¦21177 the tomb¦21179 by sealing it and placing guards¦21186 there.

\p
\v 1 After the days¦21190 of rest during the first¦21194 light of Sunday morning, Maria from Magdala¦21199 and¦21200 the other¦21202 Maria went¦21196 out to visit the tomb¦21207.
\v 2 Then¦21208, wow¦21209, there was a massive earthquake¦21210 because¦21214 one of \nd Yahweh's\nd* messengers¦21213 had come¦21216 down from heaven¦21220 and approached¦21222 the tomb. He had rolled¦21223 away the stone¦21225 and was now sitting¦21230 on it¦21232.
\v 3 He looked as if you were watching lightning¦21241 and¦21242 his¦21239 clothes¦21244 were extremely white¦21246.
\v 4 The guards¦21258 \add at the tomb\add* shook with fear¦21254 when they saw him¦21255 and¦21259 then¦21251 they fainted.
\p
\v 5 Then¦21266 the messenger¦21268 spoke to the women¦21271, “Don't be scared because¦21277 I know that both of you are looking¦21282 for¦21282 \nd Yeshua\nd* who was executed¦21281 on a stake¦21281.
\v 6 He isn't¦21283 here, because¦21287 he came back to life just like he said¦21289 he would. Go inside and see¦21291 the place¦21293 where¦21294 his \add body\add* was lying¦21295
\v 7 and then¦21298 leave straight away and go and tell his¦21304 followers that he has come alive again and will go ahead of you all to Galilee¦21316. You'll see¦21311 him when you get there¦21317. Listen¦21320, I've told you now.”
\p
\v 8 So¦21323 they¦21335 went off quickly¦21326 with a mixture of fear¦21331 and incredible happiness, and ran¦21335 \add back\add* to tell Yeshua's followers.
\p
\v 9 Then¦21347, wow¦21349, \nd Yeshua\nd* met them \add on the path\add* and greeted them. The two women¦21357 went close \add and knelt down\add* and took¦21360 hold of his¦21361 feet¦21363 and lowered their heads.
\v 10 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* spoke again, “\wj Don't be scared. Go now and tell my¦21379 brothers¦21378 so they'll go¦21382 up to Galilee¦21385 and then they'll see me there¦21388.\wj*”

\p
\v 11 After they'd left, some of the guards¦21398 \add from the tomb\add* went into the city¦21402 and¦21393 told the chief¦21406 priests¦21406 everything that had happened,
\v 12 so they met together¦21412 with the elders¦21415 and¦21411 after some discussion, they gave¦21425 a generous amount to the soldiers¦21427
\v 13 and told them, “Tell everyone that his followers came in the dark and stole¦21437 his body when you had fallen asleep¦21440.
\v 14 If the governor¦21449 hears about it, we'll butter him up so that you¦21454 won't need to be afraid \add of getting punished\add*.”
\p
\v 15 So¦21459 they took the money and¦21459 did what they had been asked.

\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 28:16: \xt Mat 26:32; Mrk 14:28.\x*The eleven¦21482 apprentices¦21483 travelled up to Galilee¦21487 to the hill that \nd Yeshua\nd* had \add previously\add* told them to go to,
\v 17 and¦21496 when they saw him there, they immediately bowed down to the ground, even though their minds weren't sure \add that it was really him\add*.
\v 18 Then¦21504 \nd Yeshua\nd* came closer and told them, “\wj I have been given¦21511 authority¦21514 over both heavenly¦21517 and earthly¦21522 affairs\wj*
\v 19 \x + \xo 28:19: \xt Acts 1:8.\x*\wj so I want you to leave here and go and train¦21527 followers¦21527 in every country, immersing¦21531 them \+add in water\+add* with the authority of the father¦21538 and the son and the holy \+nd spirit¦21545\+nd*.\wj*
\v 20 \wj Then¦21553 teach¦21546 them to do everything just like I instructed¦21551 all of you. And listen, I will be with you all every day right through until¦21563 the end of \+add this\+add* age.\wj*”
