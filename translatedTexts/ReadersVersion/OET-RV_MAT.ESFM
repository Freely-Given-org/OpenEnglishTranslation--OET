\mt2 The account of Yeshua's ministry by
\mt1 Matthew
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip The writer of this document was Matthaios, known in English as Matthew and in Hebrew as Levi. He was one of Yeshua's twelve apprentices, and named by Alfaeus his father. He was from Galilee but worked in Capernaum as a tax-collector before he left that to follow Yeshua. It's possible that it was Yeshua who changed his name from Levi when he became a follower, and named him Matthew which means ‘the gift of God’ in Hebrew.
\is2 This account
\ip Matthew's account starts by listing the ancestors of Yeshua, and then describes his birth, his immersion in water, and his temptation by the devil. He tells us about a lot of his preaching and teaching, and about how he healed many sick people in the Galilee region. After that, Matthew goes on to describe Yeshua's trip to Yerushalem and what happened to him there. Then he explains what happened in Yeshua's final week in Yerushalem, his execution on a stake, and his coming back to life.
\ip This document tells how Yeshua is the messiah, promised by God to save the Jews, and all non-Jews who place their trust in him. So by means of him, God fulfills his promises to his people that were listed in the Old Testament.
\ip This good message reveals Yeshua as the great teacher to explain God's law. Here in this document, Matthew records five lengthy teaching sessions about God's kingdom: (1) The preaching on the hill about people's behaviour, their responsibilities, and what they might expect to receive in God's kingdom (chapters 5–7); (2) warning the twelve apprentices about their works (chapter 10); (3) the parables about God's kingdom (chapter 13); (4) the teaching concerning the way to become a follower (chapter 18); and (5) the teaching concerning the end of this age and God's kingdom which is coming. (chapters 24–25).

\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18: \xt Luk 1:27.\x*Now this is how the birth¦302 of \nd Yeshua¦299\nd* came about: Maria¦311 his¦310 mother¦309 was engaged to Yosef¦313. But¦297 before¦314 they came together¦316, she¦318 was found¦318 to be pregnant through \add the work of\add* the holy \nd spirit¦323\nd*.
\v 19 But¦326 Yosef¦325, her husband¦328 \add to be\add*, was a good man, and¦326 not wishing to disgrace Maria, he decided to quietly divorce her.
\v 20 But as he was pondering this, one of Yahweh's messengers¦347 appeared¦352 to him in a dream¦351 and told him, “Yosef¦355, descendant of \add King\add* David¦357, don't¦358 be afraid¦359 to marry Maria¦361, because¦366 the baby in her has been conceived by the holy \nd spirit¦371\nd*.

\p
\v 22 Now all this happened in fulfilment¦399 of what \nd Yahweh¦404\nd* had said through¦405 the prophet¦408,
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Isa 7:14 (LXX).\x*“Listen¦410, the virgin¦412 will get pregnant and she'll have a son, and they'll call him¦424 Immanuel¦425 \add (in Hebrew)\add* which¦426 means ‘\nd God¦432\nd* with us.’ ”

\p
\v 1 After \nd Yeshua¦475\nd* had been born in Bethlehem¦478 in the province of Yudea¦480 during the time of King Herod¦483, watchers of signs arrived¦491 in Yerushalem¦493 from the east
\v 2 and asked, “Where's¦496 the one born as king¦500 of the Jews¦502? We saw¦503 his¦505 star¦507 in the east and we came¦512 to worship him.”
\p
\v 3 Now when King Herod¦520 heard¦515 this, he was upset—and¦522 all of Yerushalem¦524 as well.
\v 4 He gathered¦528 together¦528 all the chief¦531 priests¦531 and religious¦533 teachers¦533 and asked them where¦539 the \nd Messiah¦541\nd* was expected to be born.
\p
\v 5 And they¦543 told him¦547, “It'll be in Bethlehem¦549 in Yudea¦551, because¦553 the prophet¦557 wrote¦554:\x + \xo 2:5-6: \xt Mic 5:2.\x*
\q1
\v 6 ‘You, Bethlehem¦560 in the land of Yudah¦565,
\q2 are not the most insignificant of the leaders of Yudah,
\q1 because¦579 a leader will come from you
\q2 who will guide my¦587 people¦586 Yisrael¦589.’ ”
\p
\v 7 Then Herod¦591 sent for the watchers of signs and met secretly¦592 with them to determine when the star¦604 had first appeared¦603.
\v 8 Then¦605 he sent¦606 them on to Bethlehem¦609 with these instructions: “Go on and carefully investigate about the child¦619, and when you find him, report¦626 back to me so that I can also come¦630 and worship him.”
\p
\v 9 So¦634 when the king¦638 had finished speaking, they departed, and the star¦643 which they could see¦641 in the east went ahead of them and stopped above the place where¦657 the child¦661 was.
\v 10 Seeing this, the watchers of signs were very happy indeed.
\v 11 As they entered the house¦676, they saw¦677 the child¦681 with his¦687 mother¦686 Maria¦684. They bowed low and worshipped him, then¦672 they opened¦693 their¦696 chests and presented gifts¦699 of gold¦700, frankincense¦702, and myrrh¦704.
\p
\v 12 But¦705 because they'd been warned¦706 in a dream¦708 not to return¦710 to King Herod¦712, they went home again to their¦721 own country¦720.

\v 13 After they'd departed, one of \nd Yahweh's\nd* messengers¦732 appeared¦734 to Yosef¦740 in a dream¦736 and said, “Get up and take the child and his¦753 mother¦752 and flee to Egypt¦757 \add (Mitsrayim)\add*. Remain there¦760 until¦761 I tell you, because¦767 \add King\add* Herod¦768 will soon search for the child in order to kill¦775 him.”
\p
\v 14 So¦779 Yosef got up during the night¦791 and took¦782 the child¦785 and his¦790 mother¦789 and departed for Egypt¦795.
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Hos 11:1.\x*They stayed there¦798 until¦799 the death¦801 of Herod¦802, in order¦803 to fulfil¦804 what \nd Yahweh¦809\nd* had said through¦810 the prophet¦812 \add Hoshea\add*: “I called¦816 my¦819 son out of Egypt¦815.”

\p
\v 16 When \add King\add* Herod¦821 realised that he'd been tricked by the watchers of signs, he got very angry and gave orders that all the sons in Bethlehem¦838 and its¦844 districts that were two¦847 years old and younger be killed¦832, because that was the period that he'd found out from the watchers of signs.
\p
\v 17 That fulfilled¦861 what had been spoken¦863 through¦866 the prophet¦869 Jeremiah, who said:
\q1
\v 18 \x + \xo 2:18: \xt Jer 31:15.\x*The sound of great¦880 weeping and mourning¦879 was heard¦874 in Ramah;

\p
\v 19 After \add King\add* Herod¦897 died¦894, one of \nd Yahweh's\nd* messengers¦899 appeared¦901 to Yosef¦906 in Egypt¦908 in a dream¦903
\v 20 and said, “Get up and take the child and his¦919 mother¦918 and go \add back\add* to the land of Yisrael¦924, because¦926 the ones wanting to kill him have died.”
\v 21 So¦934 Yosef got up and took¦937 the child¦940 and his¦945 mother¦944 and went¦947 \add back\add* to Yisrael¦952.
\p
\v 22 But when he heard¦953 that Archelaus¦956 was reigning¦957 over Yudea instead¦961 of his¦965 father¦964 Herod¦966, and \add also\add* having been warned¦970 in a dream¦973, he left \add Yudea\add* and went to the Galilee¦979 area.

\v 22 Straight after that¦9793, Yeshua instructed his apprentices¦9780 to board¦9782 the boat¦9785 and¦9774 to head back to the other side of the lake while he dismissed the crowds¦9796.
\v 23 He sent¦9798 them all back to their homes, then¦9797 climbed up a hill by himself¦9806 to pray.

\p
\v 25 In the early hours of the morning, Yeshua went¦9847 out to them on the lake¦9859, walking¦9854 on the surface.

\v 29 “\wj Come!\wj*” he said¦9925. So¦9924 Peter¦9933 climbed \add over the back\add* of the boat¦9931 and¦9924 started walking across the lake towards \nd Yeshua¦9944\nd*,
\v 30 but¦9946 when he looked \add around\add* at the wind¦9948, he lost his nerve and started sinking and yelled¦9956 out, “\nd Master¦9958\nd*, save¦9959 me!”
\v 31 Immediately \nd Yeshua¦9965\nd* stretched¦9966 out his¦9970 hand¦9968 and took¦9969 hold of Peter and said to him, “\wj Your faith¦9975 is weak because¦9976 why did you doubt¦9978?\wj*”
\p
\v 32 Then¦9979 as soon as the two of them climbed into the boat¦9985, the wind¦9988 died¦9986 down

\v 55 \x + \xo 27:55-56: \xt Luk 8:2-3.\x*There were many women¦21130 watching all this from a distance—they were those who from Galilee¦21141 who had followed¦21136 \nd Yeshua¦21138\nd* and¦21126 looked \nd after¦21138\nd* him¦21144,
\v 56 including Maria from Magdala¦21152, Maria the mother of Yacob and Yosef, and Zebedee's¦21173 wife—the mother of Yacob and Yohan.

\p
\v 57 As it moved into evening¦21174, a wealthy¦21179 man¦21178 named Yosef¦21185 from Arimathea¦21181 came¦21177—he'd also been one of \nd Yeshua's¦21192\nd* apprentices¦21190.
\v 58 He went to Pilate and requested¦21200 \nd Yeshua's¦21204\nd* body¦21202, and Pilate commanded¦21208 the soldiers to release it¦21208.
\v 59 Yosef¦21219 took the body¦21217 and¦21212 wrapped¦21220 it¦21221 in clean¦21224, linen¦21223 cloth¦21223
\v 60 and put it in his¦21231 own tomb which¦21233 had been newly carved into the rock¦21238. Then he rolled¦21240 a big stone¦21241 into the door¦21247 of the tomb and left it.
\v 61 Maria from Magdala¦21257 and¦21258 the other¦21260 Maria sat there¦21253 in front¦21265 of the tomb¦21267.

\v 62 The next day was the day after¦21273 the Passover preparation¦21275 day and the chief¦21278 priests¦21278 and the Pharisees went together¦21276 to Pilate¦21283
\v 63 \x + \xo 27:63: \xt Mat 16:21; 17:23; 20:19; Mrk 8:31; 9:31; 10:33-34; Luk 9:22; 18:31-33.\x*and told him, “Master¦21285, we were reminded¦21286 that that deceiver¦21291 when he was still¦21293 alive said¦21292 that he would come back to life after¦21296 three¦21297 days¦21298
\v 64 so you should command¦21300 that the tomb¦21304 be secured¦21302 until¦21305 the third¦21307 day¦21308 in case someone steals¦21316 his body and then tells the people¦21323 that he has come¦21311 alive again—that would be a worse¦21333 deception¦21332 than his initial \add teachings\add*.”
\p
\v 65 “Well you all guard¦21345 it,” answered Pilate¦21342, “and¦21339 keep it secure¦21347 as you say.”
\p
\v 66 So¦21352 they¦21351 went and secured¦21354 the tomb¦21356 by sealing it and placing guards¦21363 there.

\p
\v 1 After the days¦21367 of rest during the first¦21371 light of Sunday morning, Maria from Magdala¦21377 and¦21378 the other¦21380 Maria went¦21373 out to visit the tomb¦21385.
\v 2 Then¦21386, wow¦21387, there was a massive earthquake¦21388 because¦21392 one of \nd Yahweh's¦21393\nd* messengers¦21391 had come¦21394 down from heaven¦21398 and approached¦21400 the tomb. He had rolled¦21401 away the stone¦21403 and was now sitting¦21408 on it¦21410.
\v 3 He looked as if you were watching lightning¦21419 and¦21420 his¦21417 clothes¦21422 were extremely white¦21424.
\v 4 The guards¦21436 \add at the tomb\add* shook with fear¦21432 when they saw him¦21433 and¦21437 then¦21429 they fainted.
\p
\v 5 Then¦21444 the messenger¦21446 spoke to the women¦21449, “Don't be scared because¦21455 I know that both of you are looking¦21460 for¦21460 \nd Yeshua¦21457\nd* who was executed¦21459 on a stake¦21459.
\v 6 He isn't¦21461 here, because¦21465 he came back to life just like he said¦21467 he would. Go inside and see¦21469 the place¦21471 where¦21472 his \add body\add* was lying¦21473
\v 7 and then¦21476 leave straight away and go and tell his¦21482 followers that he has come alive again and will go ahead of you all to Galilee¦21494. You'll see¦21489 him when you get there¦21495. Listen¦21498, I've told you now.”
\p
\v 8 So¦21502 they¦21514 went off quickly¦21505 with a mixture of fear¦21510 and incredible happiness, and ran¦21514 \add back\add* to tell Yeshua's followers.
\p
\v 9 Then¦21526, wow¦21528, \nd Yeshua¦21530\nd* met them \add on the path\add* and greeted them. The two women¦21536 went close \add and knelt down\add* and took¦21539 hold of his¦21540 feet¦21542 and lowered their heads.
\v 10 Then \nd Yeshua¦21551\nd* spoke again, “\wj Don't be scared. Go now and tell my¦21558 brothers¦21557 so they'll go¦21561 up to Galilee¦21564 and then they'll see me there¦21567.\wj*”

\p
\v 11 After they'd left, some of the guards¦21577 \add from the tomb\add* went into the city¦21581 and¦21572 told the chief¦21586 priests¦21586 everything that had happened,
\v 12 so they met together¦21592 with the elders¦21595 and¦21591 after some discussion, they gave¦21605 a generous amount to the soldiers¦21607
\v 13 and told them, “Tell everyone that his followers came in the dark and stole¦21617 his body when you had fallen asleep¦21620.
\v 14 If the governor¦21629 hears about it, we'll butter him up so that you¦21634 won't need to be afraid \add of getting punished\add*.”
\p
\v 15 So¦21639 they took the money and¦21639 did what they had been asked.

\v 16 \x + \xo 28:16: \xt Mat 26:32; Mrk 14:28.\x*The eleven¦21662 apprentices¦21663 travelled up to Galilee¦21667 to the hill that \nd Yeshua¦21675\nd* had \add previously\add* told them to go to,
\v 17 and¦21676 when they saw him there, they immediately bowed down to the ground, even though their minds weren't sure \add that it was really him\add*.
\v 18 Then¦21684 \nd Yeshua¦21687\nd* came closer and told them, “\wj I have been given¦21691 authority¦21694 over both heavenly¦21697 and earthly¦21702 affairs\wj*
\v 19 \x + \xo 28:19: \xt Acts 1:8.\x*\wj so I want you to leave here and go and train¦21707 followers¦21707 in every country, immersing¦21711 them \+add in water\+add* with the authority of the father¦21718 and the son and the holy \+nd spirit¦21725\+nd*.\wj*
