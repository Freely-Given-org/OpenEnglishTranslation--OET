\is1 Introduction
\ip The prophets Micah (Heb. Mikah) and Yesha'yah (Isaiah) lived at the same time—Micah came from a town in the southern kingdom of Yehudah. God revealed to Micah the coming destruction to Yehudah that had been prophesied by the prophet Amos concerning the northern kingdom. Yahweh would punish the people due to their disobedient actions and due to his anger over their biased court decisions, but the account of prophet Micah also talks about a hopeful future.
\ip Now there are famous prophecies included in this document : Yahweh's announcement about ruling the entire world and bringing of peace/prosperity (4:1-4), the prophesying concerning the coming king from David's descendants bringing of peace/prosperity (5:2-5a); and the vital command taught by prophet Micah there to Israel: “[Yahweh] has told \add ≈humanity\add* what is good, and what [he] requires from you: Act justly, love kindness, and walk humbly with your God.” (6:8)
