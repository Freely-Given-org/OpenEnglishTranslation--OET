\is1 Introduction
\ip The Greek word ‘Deuteronomy’ means ‘Second law’, because some aspects of God's instructions in the previous accounts are repeated again in this one, noticeably the Ten Commandments. Hebrew readers call this document ‘Devārim’ which is the second word in the Hebrew and means ‘Words’ or ‘Things’. Some European and other translations call it ‘The fifth book of Mosheh/Moses’.

\ip And/Now this the other important told of this document: 1. Told here the thinking of Mosheh of descendants of Israel concerning the happenings of past forty years, and the requesting he/his of descendants of Israel of remembering if immenu them of eg-inahak of Master there to wilderness. And/Now told again here the requesting of Mosheh them following and egmatinumanen of God. 2.

\v 3 Forty years \add after the Israelis¦81424 had left Egypt\add* Mosheh¦81421 \add ≈passed on\add* to \add *them\add* everything that Yahweh¦81429 had instructed¦81428 him

\v 6 “Our God¦81466 Yahweh¦81465 spoke¦81467 to us at Horev, saying: You've \add ≈camped\add* here \add ≈long enough¦81471\add* at this mountain¦81475.

\p

\p

\v 13 some wicked people have enticed those in the city to go and serve other ‘new’ gods,

\v 16 Gather all the people's possessions and pile them up in the city plaza, then burn the place and everything in it like a ‘burnt offering’ to Yahweh. Leave the place as an abandoned heap—it should never be rebuilt again.
\v 17 Don't \add be tempted\add* to \add ≈pick anything valuable out\add* from the \add ≈pile headed for destruction\add*, \add but obey carefully\add* so that Yahweh's \add ≈anger will subside\add*.

\v 13 \add After\add* you've brought in the grain harvest and pressed out the grape juice, you must celebrate the ‘Festival of Shelters’ for seven days.\x + \xo 16:13-15: \xt Lev 23:33-36,39-43; Num 29:12-38.\x*
\v 14 You should celebrate along with your children and your servants, as well as any Levites and foreigners and orphans and widows who live in your town.
\v 15 \add Honour\add* your god Yahweh at the place \add *he'll\add* choose, by celebrating for seven days because \add *he's\add* blessed your harvest and \add ≈all your other work\add*.
\p
\v 16 \add In summary,\add* all your men must travel three times each year to the place that your god Yahweh will choose: at the Flat Bread Celebration, at the Festival of Weeks, and at the Festival of Shelters. \add ≈No man should come empty-handed\add*,
\v 17 \add but rather,\add* each man \add ≈must give in proportion\add* to the blessings that your god Yahweh has given you \add during that year\add*.

\rem /s1 Municipal Judges and Officers; Justice for the People; Judges; The Administration of Justice
\p
\v 18 You must appoint judges and other officials throughout your tribes, in all the towns that your god Yahweh is giving to you. They must judge the people \add ≈fairly and correctly\add*.
\v 19 You mustn't \add ≈pervert justice or give favours\add*. Don't accept bribes because a bribe causes \add an otherwise\add* wise person to \add ≈ignore evil\add* and \add ≈misrepresents what innocent people say\add*.\x + \xo 16:19: \xt Exo 23:6-8; Lev 19:15.\x*

\p
\v 1 Don't sacrifice any \add ≈animal\add* to your god Yahweh that has any blemish or defect, because \add *he\add* detests that.
\p
\v 2 In any of the towns that your god Yahweh is giving you, if you discover any man or woman who does evil by disobeying the agreement that \add *he's\add* made with you
\v 3 and \add ≈worshipped\add* other gods, or the sun, moon, or stars—all of which I've prohibited you from doing,\x + \xo 17:3: \xt Exo 22:20.\x*
\v 4 and it it's reported to you, and you listen and investigate it thoroughly, and it's true that this detestable thing was done in Yisrael,
\v 5 you must bring that man or woman out to the \add town\add* gates, and \add ≈execute them by throwing rocks at them\add*.
\v 6 \add Note that\add* that person can only be executed if there's at least two witnesses \add as evidence\add*—no one can be put to death on the testimony of just one witness.\x + \xo 17:6: \xt Num 35:30; Deu 19:15; Mat 18:16; 2Cor 13:1; 1Tim 5:19; Heb 10:28.\x*

\p
\v 8 If a case is too difficult for you yourselves to judge \add ≈(e.g., two parties claiming bloodshed, or lawsuits, or assaults, or other disputes within your towns)\add*, you must leave town and go to the place that your god Yahweh is going to choose.
\v 9 You should go to the \add ≈Levitical priests\add* and to the judge \add ≈on duty there\add* and they will \add ≈produce\add* a judgement.
\v 10 Whatever the decision is that's made at the place Yahweh will choose, \add ≈that's the verdict that must be applied to the case\add*—
\v 11 accept their judgement and do what they say without making any adjustments to their decision.
