\is1 Introduction
\ip The Greek word ‘Deuteronomy’ means ‘Second law’, because some aspects of God's instructions in the previous accounts are repeated again in this one, noticeably the Ten Commandments. Hebrew readers call this document ‘Devārim’ which is the second word in the Hebrew and means ‘Words’ or ‘Things’. Some European and other translations call it ‘The fifth book of Mosheh/Moses’.

\ip And/Now this the other important told of this document: 1. Told here the thinking of Mosheh of descendants of Israel concerning the happenings of past forty years, and the requesting he/his of descendants of Israel of remembering if immenu them of eg-inahak of Master there to wilderness. And/Now told again here the requesting of Mosheh them following and egmatinumanen of God. 2.

\v 2 (It takes eleven days \add to walk\add* from Horev \add (Mt. Sinai)\add* to Kadesh¦81408-Barnea¦81409 via Mt. Seir¦81406.)
\v 3 Forty years \add after the Israelis¦81424 had left Egypt\add* Mosheh¦81421 \add ≈passed on\add* to \add *them\add* everything that Yahweh¦81429 had instructed¦81428 him

\v 6 “Our God¦81466 Yahweh¦81465 spoke¦81467 to us at Horev, saying: You've \add ≈camped\add* here \add ≈long enough¦81471\add* at this mountain¦81475.

\v 3 You \add ≈need to be confident\add* that your god¦86303 Yahweh will go \add ≈ahead of you like a raging fire¦86308\add*—he'll destroy them and subdue¦86313 them ahead of you, then you can drive¦86315 them out and quickly¦86318 eliminate them as Yahweh has told you \add to do\add*.

\v 4 After your god¦86330 Yahweh has driven¦86328 them out ahead of you, don't¦86324 go saying that it was thanks to your \add own\add* \add ≈goodness and innocence\add*, because it's because of the wickedness¦86343 of those peoples that Yahweh is \add ≈doing that\add*.

\v 8 \add ≈Even\add* at Horev \add (Mt. Sinai)\add* you made Yahweh¦86443 angry, \add in fact\add* he was angry enough to destroy¦86447 you.
\v 9 When I went¦86450 up the mountain to receive the stone¦86454 tablets containing Yahweh's agreement with you, I stayed up on the mountain for forty days and nights¦86467 \add ≈without eating or drinking\add*.\x + \xo 9:9: \xt Exo 24:18.\x*

\v 11 \add ≈Then¦86500 finally\add* at the end of those forty days and nights¦86505, Yahweh¦86507 gave¦86506 me those two¦86511 stone¦86513 tablets \add ≈with the agreement written on them\add*.
\p
\v 12 Then¦86517 \add *he\add* told me, ‘\add ≈Now hurry and\add* go¦86521 down quickly from here, because your people¦86526 who you brought¦86528 out from Egypt¦86529, have become corrupted¦86525. They \add ≈didn't take at all long to turn away from following my instructions\add*—they've \add already\add* made a metal \add idol\add* for themselves.’

\p
\v 15 \add ≈So¦86575\add* I turned¦86575 and headed back down the mountain that was still burning¦86581 with fire¦86582, carrying the two tablets¦86584 with the agreement \add written on them\add*.
\v 16 Then¦86590 I looked, and¦86591 wow, you \add certainly\add* had disobeyed your god¦86594 Yahweh. You'd cast a metal¦86598 calf. You'd turned¦86599 so quickly¦86600 from the instructions that Yahweh had given you.
\v 17 I grabbed those two \add stone\add* tablets¦86612 and threw¦86613 them to the ground—shattering them right in front of your eyes¦86618.
\v 18 Then¦86620 I lay on the ground in front¦86621 of Yahweh for forty days and nights¦86627 without eating or drinking because of how you'd disobeyed Yahweh—doing¦86640 evil¦86641 things that provoked¦86644 him into being angry.
\v 19 \add ≈Yes,\add* I was afraid¦86647 that \add ≈in his terrible anger, Yahweh¦86653 might destroy¦86655 you, but\add* \add *he\add* listened¦86657 to me at that time.\x + \xo 9:19: \xt Heb 12:21.\x*

\v 25 \add ≈So¦86760\add* I \add ≈lay on the ground in Yahweh's presence\add* for forty days and nights¦86769, because \add *he\add* said¦86774 he'd destroy¦86776 you all,

\v 16 Gather all the people's possessions and pile them up in the city¦88842 plaza, then burn the place and everything in it like a ‘burnt offering’ to Yahweh. Leave the place as an abandoned heap—it should never be rebuilt again.

\rem /s1 Levirate Marriage; Duty to a Dead Brother
\p
\v 5 If some brothers¦93793 live \add ≈on the same property\add* and one of them dies¦93795 without leaving a son, then the widow mustn't marry outside \add ≈of the family\add*. Her¦93811 brother-in-law must take¦93814 her¦93811 as a wife¦93805 for himself and \add ≈perform¦93817 the duty of\add* a brother-in-law.\x + \xo 25:5-6: \xt Mat 22:24; Mrk 12:19; Luk 20:28.\x*
\v 6 If she gives birth to a son \add in due course\add*, he'll be considered as the son of the brother who died, so that his \add family\add* name won't¦93829 disappear from Yisrael.
\v 7 \add ≈But¦93835 if the dead man's brother doesn't want to marry the widow\add*, she must go to the elders¦93849 at the city gate and \add ≈explain that her brother-in-law is refusing¦93851 to do his duty to preserve\add* the dead brother's \add family\add* name in Yisrael¦93856.\x + \xo 25:7-10: \xt Rut 4:7-8.\x*
\v 8 Then¦93861 those elders¦93864 must summon¦93861 \add @the brother\add* and talk to him. \add ≈However¦93872,\add* if he \add ≈really\add* doesn't want to marry¦93873 her¦93873,
\v 9 then his \add late\add* brother's wife must go up to him in front of those elders¦93879, and take his sandal¦93881 off his foot¦93883 and spit in his face¦93885. Then¦93875 she must say, ‘That's what happens to a man who won't¦93892 \add ≈strengthen his brother's family\add*.’
\v 10 \add After that,\add* the brother will be known in Yisrael as the man who had his sandal¦93907 taken off.

\v 11 If two men¦93913 are fighting each other, and one man's wife¦93918 comes¦93917 to help her¦93927 husband¦93923, and reaches out and grabs the other man's private parts,
\v 12 then you must cut her hand¦93934 off. Don't pity her.
\s1 Don't all cheat
\p
\v 13 Don't keep two stone \add weights\add* in your¦93944 bag—a \add ≈lighter one\add* and a \add ≈heavier one\add* \add for when you're buying and selling\add*.\x + \xo 25:13-16: \xt Lev 19:35-36.\x*
\v 14 Don't keep \add ≈two measuring containers\add* in your¦93955 house¦93955—a smaller¦93959 \add one\add* and a larger¦93958 \add one\add*.
\v 15 You must use exact stone \add weights¦93961\add* and \add ≈measuring¦93967 containers\add* so that your god¦93981 Yahweh¦93980 will prolong your time in the \add ≈country\add* that he's giving you—

\v 18 They met you on the road, then attacked¦94012 you from behind¦94017—\add getting\add* the stragglers who were weak and exhausted¦94020. They had no fear of God¦94024.
\v 19 \add ≈At some point in the future when\add* your god Yahweh¦94028 has given¦94027 you the land to occupy as an inheritance¦94043, and \add ≈you're no longer being attacked by your\add* enemies¦94034, you must \add ≈eliminate the Amalekites so they won't¦94052 be remembered¦94048 anymore\add*.

\v 3 Go to the \add high\add* priest¦94105 \add ≈in office\add* at that time, and tell him, “I declare¦94112 today to your¦94115 god¦94115 Yahweh¦94114 that I've entered the land that \add *he\add* promised to our ancestors¦94125 to give¦94126 us.”

\v 5 Then¦94139 in Yahweh's presence you should respond, “My ancestor was a wandering¦94146 Aramean¦94145, and he went down to Egypt¦94149 with his \add ≈smallish family\add*, and lived¦94150 there and \add eventually\add* became a large and powerful people¦94152.

\v 10 \add ≈So¦94222 now\add*, Yahweh, I've brought¦94224 the first¦94227 part of the harvest from that land that you've given¦94232 me.”
\p Then¦94222 \add ≈as\add* the basket is placed¦94235 in front of Yahweh, you must bow down in front of \add *him\add*.
