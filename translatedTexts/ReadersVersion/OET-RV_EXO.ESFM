\is1 Introduction
\ip The word \bk Exodus\bk* comes from the Greek word meaning ‘departure’ or ‘leaving’. Hebrew readers call this document ‘Shemōt’ which is the second word in the Hebrew and means ‘Names’ because it begins with a list of names. Some European and other translations call it ‘The second book of Mosheh/Moses’.
\ip It should be noted that ‘Mosheh’ is the best English transliteration of the name of the hero of this account. Sadly, he's commonly known in the English world as ‘Moses’, even though we have all the sounds in our language to be able to pronounce his name more accurately. Unfortunately, because the language of ‘the New Testament’ didn't have the ‘sh’ sound and had no letter for ‘h’, his Hebrew version of his Egyptian name is corrupted as it goes through Greek ‘Mōsaʸs’ and then Latin ‘Moyses’ and then first entered English in the 1300's as ‘Moises’. Now that we live in a modern era where we try to show more respect to the names of peoples from other cultures, the \em OET\em* encourages the same for Biblical characters (especially the major ones), hence ‘Mosheh’. (Maybe a little bit of relearning could demonstrate a lot of respect to the Jewish people whose ancestors are recorded in these accounts.)
\ip After God had used a famine to cause his people to go down into Egypt (Heb. Mitsrayim), this document records how they eventually become slaves, but then God works many miracles to enable them to leave again, and not only that, to be paid at the end for their work.
\ip This story can be divided into three main parts: 1. their slavery in Egypt, and how God called Mosheh (Moses), the child who had been adopted by an Egyptian princess, to lead them out of slavery; 2. how God assisted them when they were chased by the Egyptian army, then when they reached Mt. Sinai, how they were miraculously given food and drink there at the mountain; 3. how Yahweh revealed himself to Mosheh there at Mt. Sinai, and gave him instructions to guide their lives and their nation, and God's agreement with the people; 4. the ending is the construction of the sacred tent, complete with instructions about how they should worship.
\ip An overview would be how God rescued his people from slavery and established them as a nation that was hopeful of a good future.
\ip \em Mosheh\em* is the most important person in this account. He was chosen by God to lead his people out of slavery and right out of Egypt. The \em ten commands\em* are another well-known component of this document and can be found in chapter twenty.

\s1 Yisra'el's descendants are driven into slavery
\rem /s1 The Israelites Are Treated Cruelly in Egypt; The Israelites Oppressed; The Israelites in Egypt
\p
\v 1 These are the names¦25402 of Yisra'el's descendants who accompanied Yacob¦25408 (Jacob) when he moved his household¦25410 to Egypt¦25406:\x + \xo 1:1-4: \xt Gen 46:8-27.\x*
\v 2 Reuben¦25413, Simeon¦25414, Levi¦25415, Yehudah¦25416,
\v 3 Yissashkar¦25418 (Issachar), Zebulun¦25419, Benyamin¦25420,
\v 4 Dan¦25423, Naftali¦25424, Gad¦25425, and Asher¦25426.
\v 5 \add At that time,\add* Yacob¦25435 had a total of seventy¦25436 descendants (including Yosef¦25438 \add and¦25438 his sons\add* who were \add already\add* in Egypt¦25440.)
\p
\v 6 \add As the years progressed,\add* Yosef¦25443 and his brothers¦25446 died¦25442—all of that generation¦25448,
\v 7 \add but they'd had many children who went on to have their own children and grandchildren,\add* and so they became a large and powerful group \add there in Egypt¦25452\add*.\x + \xo 1:7: \xt Acts 7:17.\x*
\rem /s1 The Israelites Are Oppressed
\p
\v 8 \add Eventually\add* a new king¦25465 came to power in Egypt¦25470 \add (Mitsrayim)\add* who had never known Yosef¦25477\x + \xo 1:8: \xt Acts 7:18.\x*
\v 9 and he told his people, “Listen, those descendants of Yisrael¦25486 \add (Israel¦25486)\add* are becoming more numerous¦25487 and powerful¦25488 than us.
\v 10 \add So\add*, let's deal wisely¦25492 with them, in case they \add continue to\add* multiply. Then if war was to break out, they could easily take the other side and fight¦25509 against us, and then leave our country.”\x + \xo 1:10: \xt Acts 7:19.\x*
\v 11 Then¦25517 they appointed¦25517 overseers¦25519 to work them in slave¦25520 gangs¦25520, and using them as forced¦25523 labour¦25523, they built¦25524 the store¦25526 cities¦25525 at Pithon¦25530 and Rameses¦25533 for Far'oh¦25527 (Pharaoh).
\v 12 \add However,\add* the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied and spread¦25541 out, and \add the more\add* the Egyptians came¦25542 to dread¦25542 the Israelis¦25545.
\v 13 \add So¦25547 they\add* made the Israelis¦25552 work \add long, hard hours\add*,
\v 14 and they made their lives¦25558 bitter¦25555 with the hard slavery. \add They were forced to make\add* mortar¦25561 and bricks¦25562, as well as all kinds of slave labour¦25573 in the fields¦25566—all the work they had to do was \add strenuous and tiring\add*.
\p
\v 15 Then¦25577 the king¦25578 of Egypt¦25579 spoke to Shiphrah¦25585 and¦25586 Puah¦25588, the two Hebrew¦25581 midwives¦25580,
\v 16 saying, “When you assist the Hebrew¦25594 women as midwives¦25591, \add as you sit there on your\add* stool, if you see¦25595 that it's a male, do \add something\add* so he'll die, but if it's a female, then let her live¦25609.”
\v 17 But¦25611 the midwives¦25612 \add were godly women\add* and didn't¦25616 do according to what the Egyptian¦25622 king¦25621 \add had instructed\add* them, and they¦25617 let the boys live¦25623.
\v 18 \add So¦25628\add* the king¦25629 called¦25628 the midwives¦25632 \add back\add*, and he \add demanded\add*, “Why¦25631 have you done that and let \add their\add* sons live¦25639?”
\p
\v 19 “Because the Hebrew¦25653 women aren't¦25650 like Egyptian women,” the midwives \add ≈answered\add*. “They're \add more active\add* and give birth¦25662 before¦25658 the midwife \add even\add* gets to them.”
\v 20 \add So¦25664\add* God¦25665 rewarded the midwives¦25666, and \add meanwhile,\add* the people¦25668 \add continued to increase in number\add* and become more powerful,
\v 21 and because the midwives¦25676 had \add demonstrated their desire to obey\add* God¦25677, he gave them families \add of their own\add*.
\v 22 Then¦25684 Far'oh¦25685 commanded¦25684 all of his people¦25688, “You¦25694 \add all need to\add* toss¦25695 every¦25690 newborn boy into the river, but you can let the girls live¦25699.”\x + \xo 1:22: \xt Acts 7:19.\x*

\s1 The birth of Mosheh (Moses)
\rem /s1 Moses; The Birth of Moses; Birth and Youth of Moses
\p
\v 1 \add During this period,\add* a man¦25703 from the tribe of Levi¦25705 married a woman who was also a Levite,
\v 2 and she conceived¦25713 and gave¦25715 birth¦25715 to a son. When¦25718 she saw¦25717 that he was a \add healthy\add* boy, she hid him away for three¦25724 months¦25725,\x + \xo 2:2: \xt Acts 7:20; Heb 11:23.\x*
\v 3 \add but\add* then she wasn't able to hide him any longer. \add So¦25727\add* she got a basket made from \add woven\add* reeds and plastered it with bitumen and pitch¦25739. Then¦25727 she put the baby in it, and floated \add the basket\add* in the reeds along the riverbank,
\v 4 \add leaving the baby's\add* sister¦25753 to watch from a distance¦25754 to see¦25755 what would happen to him.
\p
\v 5 \add After a while,\add* Far'oh's daughter¦25762 came down to the river¦25774 to wash \add herself\add*, and \add she and\add* her young \add attendants¦25769\add* were walking¦25770 along the \add riverbank\add*. She saw¦25775 the container among the reeds¦25780 and sent¦25781 \add one of\add* her slave¦25784 women to get it.
\v 6 She opened¦25787 it and saw¦25788 the baby inside, and wow, he \add started\add* crying¦25795. She felt sorry¦25796 for him and said¦25798, “This baby \add must be\add* one of the Hebrew¦25800 children¦25799.”
\p
\v 7 Then¦25803 his sister¦25804 \add approached and\add* asked \add the princess\add*, “Would¦25809 you like me to go¦25810 and find a Hebrew¦25816 woman¦25813 who'll be able to breastfeed the baby for you?”
\p
\v 8 “\add Yes,\add* go¦25829,” answered Far'oh's daughter¦25826, and the girl¦25831 went¦25830 and got the baby's mother¦25835.
\v 9 “Take this baby,” said¦25838 the \add princess\add*, “and breastfeed him for me, and I'll pay you \add for doing it\add*.” \add So¦25838\add* the woman¦25856 took¦25855 the baby and \add looked after\add* him.
\v 10 \add When\add* the boy had grown \add enough\add*, she brought¦25863 him \add back\add* to Far'oh's daughter¦25864 and he became her son. She named him ‘Mosheh¦25873’\f + \fr 2:10 \ft More familiar to most English readers as ‘Moses’ from the Greek ‘Μωσῆς’ (Mōsaʸs) but Greek doesn't have an ‘h’ or a ‘sh’ so by going through Greek we ended up with something quite different from his real name. However, English does have those sounds and letters, so there's no reason why we can't get this name correct.\f* \add (which means ‘pulled out’)\add* because she said¦25874 that she'd \add plucked\add* him out of the \add river\add*.\x + \xo 2:10: \xt Acts 7:21.\x*

\p
\v 11 \add Later on\add* when Mosheh¦25886 was fully grown¦25885, he went out to visit \add the Hebrews\add* and saw their¦25892 \add forced¦25892 labour¦25892\add*, and he saw an Egyptian man beating a Hebrew man—one of his own people.\x + \xo 2:11-14: \xt Acts 7:23-28.\x*
\v 12 \add Mosheh\add* looked¦25902 around to check that no one was watching, then he hit the Egyptian, \add killing him,\add* then he hid his body in the sand.
\v 13 The next day¦25917, he went¦25916 out again and wow, two¦25920 Hebrew men¦25922 were fighting each other, and he said¦25925 to the man in the wrong¦25926, “Why are you hitting your \add fellow Hebrew\add*?”
\p
\v 14 “Who made you the ruler and judge¦25936 over us?” \add the man¦25934 replied\add*. “Are you \add planning\add* to kill¦25938 me like you killed¦25942 \add that\add* Egyptian?” Then¦25931 Mosheh¦25947 was afraid¦25946 because he realised that what he'd done had \add probably become widely\add* known¦25950.
\v 15 \add Indeed,\add* when Far'oh¦25954 heard about it, he \add ordered\add* Mosheh to be killed. \add So¦25953\add* Mosheh had to flee from \add the king\add* and he \add took off east\add* to live in Midian¦25971 and he stayed near the well.\x + \xo 2:15: \xt Acts 7:29; Heb 11:27.\x*
\p
\v 16 The¦25984 priest¦25977 there in Midian¦25978 had seven¦25979 daughters¦25980, and they would come to the well to draw water out and fill up the troughs¦25986 there so their¦25989 father's¦25989 \add sheep and goats\add* could drink.
\v 17 Now¦25998 some male shepherds¦25992 came along and \add started to\add* shoo their flock¦26000 away, but Mosheh¦25995 got involved and helped them so that their animals could drink.
\v 18 \add When\add* they \add got home\add* to their¦26006 father¦26006 Reuel¦26005, he \add asked\add*, “How come¦26010 you¦26009 \add got home\add* so early today?”
\p
\v 19 “There was an Egyptian man¦26014,” they \add ≈answered\add*, “who stood up for us against those \add other\add* shepherds¦26018. And he even drew \add water\add* for us and gave our flock¦26027 water to drink.”
\p
\v 20 “Where is he \add now\add*?” he \add asked them\add*. “What's this—you mean you all just left him there? Go and get him \add so we can give him a meal\add*.”
\p
\v 21 \add Later it turned out that\add* Mosheh was prepared to live with the man¦26050, and¦26051 \add in due course\add* he gave¦26051 his daughter¦26055 Zipporah¦26054 to Mosheh \add in marriage\add*.
\v 22 \add When\add* she gave¦26058 birth¦26058 to a son, he named him ‘Gershom¦26064’ \add (which means ‘foreigner’)\add* because he said¦26066, “I've become¦26068 a foreigner \add living\add* in a foreign¦26070 land.”
\p
\v 23 \add Eventually\add* Egypt's¦26079 king¦26078 died¦26077, \add but\add* the Israelis¦26083 groaned¦26080 from the slavery \add they were still under\add* and they cried¦26087 out, and their¦26089 cry¦26089 \add for freedom\add* from slavery went¦26088 up to God¦26092.
\v 24 \add He\add* heard their¦26101 groaning¦26101 and remembered¦26102 his agreement with Abraham¦26109, with Yitshak, and with Yacob¦26115,\x + \xo 2:24: \xt Gen 15:13-14.\x*
\v 25 and he \add looked down on\add* the Israelis¦26122 and he \add was concerned about them\add*.

\p
\v 1 \add One time\add* Mosheh¦26127 (Moses) was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law¦26134 Yetro (or Jethro, the priest¦26135 at Midian¦26136), and he led the flock beyond the wilderness¦26142 and came¦26143 to a hill. (\add This was later known as\add* the mountain¦26146 of God¦26147 at Horev¦26148).
\v 2 \add While he was there.\add* Yahweh's¦26152 messenger¦26151 appeared¦26150 to him in a flame¦26154 coming from the middle of a bush, and as \add Mosheh\add* looked, to his surprise \add he saw that\add* the bush was burning¦26162 in the fire yet not \add actually\add* being burnt up.\x + \xo 3:2-10: \xt Acts 7:30-34.\x*
\v 3 “I've got to go and¦26173 see¦26173 this amazing sight¦26176,” Mosheh¦26169 said¦26168 \add to himself\add*. “How come that bush isn't¦26180 burning¦26182 up?”
\p
\v 4 When Yahweh¦26186 saw¦26185 that he'd left his path in order to look, God¦26192 called¦26190 to him from the middle of the bush, “Mosheh, Mosheh.”
\p “I'm here,” he \add ≈replied\add*.
\p
\v 5 “Don't come any closer,” \add Yahweh\add* said¦26201. “Take off your sandals¦26208 because the place¦26212 where you're¦26214 standing¦26215 is HOLY ground¦26217.
\v 6 I'm the god of your father and the god of Abraham¦26227, Yitshak, and Yacob¦26231.” \add So¦26222\add* Mosheh¦26233 covered hid his face because he was scared to look¦26237 at God¦26224.
\p
\v 7 “I've certainly noticed the suffering¦26262 of my people¦26249 in Egypt¦26251,” Yahweh¦26243 \add continued¦26242\add*, “I've heard¦26255 their cries as the \add slave drivers\add* oppress them—I'm unmistakingly aware of their pain.
\v 8 \add So¦26264\add* I've come¦26264 down to set them free from Egyptian control and to bring¦26269 them up from \add there\add* to a good¦26277 and wide land—a land flowing¦26282 with milk and honey¦26284. \add It's currently\add* the place¦26287 of the Canaanites¦26288, the Hittites¦26289, the Amorites¦26290, the Perizzites¦26291, the Hivites¦26292, and the Yebusites¦26293.

\p
\v 11 “Who am I, that I should go¦26337 to Far'oh¦26340,” Mosheh¦26330 \add asked\add* God¦26333, “and¦26341 that I should \add be the one to\add* bring¦26342 out the Israelis¦26346 out from Egypt¦26347?”

\v 9 And then, even if they don't¦26729 believe those two miracles and \add won't¦26729 believe what you tell them\add*, then you should take some water from the river and pour it onto the dry land.

\v 11 “Who \add was it that made people's mouths¦26789\add*?” Yahweh said¦26784. “Who makes \add someone\add* mute or deaf, or seeing¦26799 or blind¦26801? Isn't it me, Yahweh?

\v 1 After that, Mosheh¦27158 and Aharon¦27159 went¦27157 in and said¦27160 to Far'oh¦27163, “This is what Yisrael's¦27169 god¦27168 Yahweh¦27167 says¦27166: ‘Let my people¦27173 go¦27170, \add so\add* they can celebrate me \add out\add* in the wilderness¦27176.’ ”

\rem /s1 Making Bricks without Straw
\p
\v 6 Then¦27249 on that \add very same\add* day¦27251, Far'oh¦27250 ordered the people's¦27256 slave masters and¦27257 supervisors,
\v 7 “Don't give¦27264 straw to the people¦27266 to make bricks¦27268 with as \add you've done up till now\add*. They can go and gather¦27273 straw for themselves.
\v 8 But¦27277 \add keep\add* the \add same\add* quota of bricks¦27280 \add as before\add*—don't¦27288 decrease it because they \add must be\add* idle \add if they have time to say\add*, ‘Let us go—let us sacrifice¦27302 to our god¦27303.’
\v 9 \add Give the men¦27309 more work so they'll be too busy to worry about deceptive words¦27316\add*.”
\p
\v 10 \add So¦27320\add* the slave masters and supervisors of the people went out and told \add them all\add*, “\add The king\add* has said that he won't¦27332 give you any more straw¦27335,

\v 12 So¦27350 the people¦27351 dispersed throughout all of Egypt¦27355 to gather¦27356 stubble¦27357 for straw¦27358,
\v 13 and the taskmasters¦27360 were \add hassling\add* them, saying, “\add Hurry up and\add* finish your¦27364 day's work, the same as when \add you were given\add* straw¦27371.”
\v 14 Then¦27373 the Israeli foremen¦27374 that Far'oh's slave masters had appointed¦27379 were beaten¦27373 and told, “Why haven't you¦27386 met your¦27387 required¦27387 brick¦27388 making \add quota\add* yesterday or today? \add It's just the same as in the past\add*.”
\p
\v 15 \add So¦27398\add* the Israeli foremen¦27399 went¦27398 and¦27402 complained to Far'oh¦27405, “Why are you¦27408 treating your¦27410 servants¦27410 like this?
\v 16 We haven't been given¦27414 any straw and yet they're telling us to keep making bricks¦27416. And see, we your servants get beaten, but it's your people's¦27424 mistake.”

\v 17 “You're all lazy—plain lazy!” \add the king responded¦27426\add*. “That's why you're saying¦27434, ‘Let us go¦27435 sacrifice¦27436 to Yahweh¦27437.’

\v 4 \add What's more,\add* I made an agreement with them: to give¦27589 them the Canaan¦27594 region—the area which¦27598 they¦27600 had been staying in.
\v 5 \add Furthermore,\add* I've heard¦27606 the complaints from the Israelis¦27611 who have been enslaved by the Egyptians, and¦27616 I have remembered¦27616 my agreement.
\v 6 Therefore, tell the Israelis¦27625, ‘I am Yahweh¦27628 and I will \add help you escape from\add* the \add control\add* of the Egyptians and rescue you from their¦27636 slavery. I'll buy you out of slavery using my power and by \add punishing the Egyptians for this injustice\add*.
\v 7 I'll take¦27644 you all to be my own people¦27647, and I'll be your god. Then¦27644 you'll know¦27651 that I am Yahweh¦27654 your god—the one rescuing you all from the Egyptian oppression.

\v 15 \add So\add* go to Far'oh¦28264. Listen, \add every\add* morning¦28265 he goes \add down\add* to the \add river\add*, so station yourself to meet him on the bank. Take the staff¦28275 with you that¦28276 turned into a snake¦28279,
\v 16 and tell him, ‘Yahweh¦28285, the god¦28286 of the Hebrews¦28287, \add previously\add* sent me to you to say, “Let¦28292 my people¦28294 go¦28291 \add so\add* they can serve me in the wilderness¦28296.” But¦28283 listen¦28300, until¦28301 now you haven't \add done it\add*
\v 17 so Yahweh says¦28306, “\add Now\add* you¦28309 will know¦28309 that¦28318 I am Yahweh because of this: See, I'm about¦28315 to use my staff¦28317 to strike¦28315 the water¦28323 in the Nile and it will turn to blood¦28327\x + \xo 7:17: \xt Rev 16:4.\x*
\v 18 and the fish¦28329 in the river will die and the river will stink¦28334. Then¦28329 \add your people\add* will \add gag\add* to drink¦28338 \add the\add* water¦28339 from the river.” ’
\p
\v 19 “Tell Aharon¦28353 to take his staff¦28355 and stretch¦28356 out his hand over the waters of Egypt¦28362: over their streams, their canals¦28369, and their pools, and over every¦28374 reservoir of their water, and \add the water\add* will become¦28378 blood. Then there'll be blood in \add the entire¦28383 country\add*—even in wooden or stone¦28388 containers \add of water\add*.”
\p
\v 20 \add So¦28390\add* And Mosheh¦28393 and Aharon did \add exactly\add* what Yahweh¦28398 had commanded¦28397: \add Aharon\add* raised¦28399 the staff¦28400 and struck¦28401 the river, while Far'oh¦28408 and his servants \add watched\add*, and the \add entire¦28412\add* river turned¦28411 to blood¦28418.
\v 21 Then¦28420 the fish¦28420 in the river died and the river stank¦28425, so the Egyptians couldn't drink¦28431 water¦28432 from the river, and the blood¦28437 was all \add over\add* Egypt¦28430.
\v 22 \add But¦28443\add* the Egyptian¦28447 sorcerers did the same with their¦28448 magic, and \add so\add* Far'oh¦28452 \add stayed stubborn\add* and wouldn't listen¦28455 to them, just as Yahweh¦28459 had said¦28458 \add earlier\add*.
\v 23 The Far'oh¦28462 turned¦28461 around and went¦28463 \add back to\add* his house¦28466, and he¦28469 \add put all of that out of his mind¦28470\add*.
\v 24 \add Meanwhile,\add* all the Egyptians dug holes around¦28479 the river to get water to drink, because river water was undrinkable.
\s1 Plague 2: Frogs everywhere
\p
\v 25 \add So¦28490\add* a week went by since Yahweh¦28496 had struck¦28494 the river
\c 8
\rem /s2 Frogs
\rem /s1 The Second Plague: Frogs; A Plague of Frogs
\v 1 and \add he\add* said¦28567 to Mosheh¦28571, “Go to Far'oh and tell him, ‘Yahweh¦28568 says that you \add must\add* let my people go \add so \add* they can serve me.\f + \fr 8:1 \ft This is 7:26 in some versifications (and the following three verses are 7:27, 28, & 29).\f*
\v 2 \add But\add* if you refuse to let \add them\add* go, then look, I'm about to pound your entire territory with frogs¦28609.
\v 3 The frogs¦28625 will swarm in the river, then they'll climb out and go into your house and in your bedroom and onto your bed. They'll go into your servants' houses and among your people, and in your \add cooking\add* bowls and into your ovens.
\v 4 They'll climb on you and on your people and on all your servants.’ ”
\p
\v 5 Then Yahweh said¦28653 to Mosheh¦28654, “Tell Aharon: Hold your staff out over the canals, the streams, and the pools, and cause the frogs¦28665 to come up onto the land of Egypt.”
\v 6 \add So\add* Aharon reached out his hand over the Egyptian water \add supplies\add* and frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
\v 7 \add But\add* the sorcerers did the same with their magic, and they¦28694 \add too\add* brought up frogs¦28687 over the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 8 Then Far'oh¦28701 called for Mosheh and Aharon¦28699, and told \add them\add*, “Ask Yahweh to take the frogs¦28710 away from me and from my people. Then I'll let \add your\add* people go, and they can sacrifice to Yahweh.”
\p
\v 9 Mosheh¦28720 answered, “I'll pray for you and your servants and your people, \add praying that\add* the frogs¦28722 will keep away from you and your homes and only be left in the river. \add And I'll give you the honour of specifying when it'll happen\add*.”
\p
\v 10 “Tomorrow \add morning\add*,” \add the king replied\add*.
\p “Just as you say,” \add Mosheh responded\add*, “so that you'll know that there's no one \add else\add* like our god Yahweh.
\v 11 \add Tomorrow\add* the frogs will leave you and go away from your houses, and from your servants and your people. They'll only be left in the river.”
\v 12 Then Mosheh and Aharon¦28768 left Far'oh and Mosheh called out to Yahweh¦28761 concerning the \add retraction\add* of the frogs that he'd sent against \add the king\add*.
\v 13 \add So\add* Yahweh did what Mosheh had requested and the frogs died off from the houses and the courtyards, and from the fields.
\v 14 \add The¦28822 people\add* collected them into many piles and the \add whole country\add* stank.
\v 15 \add But when\add* Far'oh¦28837 saw that there was \add relief from the frogs\add*, he \add firmed his resolve\add* and didn't¦28845 listen¦28847 to \add Mosheh and Aharon\add*, just as Yahweh¦28851 had said \add previously\add*.
\s1 Plague 3: Lice
\rem /s1 A Plague of Gnats; The Third Plague: Gnats; The Plague of Gnats
\p
\v 16 Then Yahweh¦28856 said¦28855 to Mosheh¦28859, “Tell Aharon: Stretch out your staff and strike the dust on the ground, and it will turn into lice\f + \fr 8:16 \ft The Hebrew word ‘כֵּן/כִּנִּם’ (kēn/kinnim) could refer to either lice, gnats, or fleas. However, unlike lice, gnats don't usually \em reside\em* on people and animals (which seems to be implied by the text).\f* all over Egypt.”
\v 17 So Aharon held out his staff and struck the dust \add with it\add*, and \add the dust\add* became lice on the people and on the animals. All over Egypt¦28897, the dust turned into lice
\v 18 and the sorcerers tried to do the same with their magic but they were unable to. \add So\add* there¦28923 were lice on people¦28917 and animals
\v 19 and the magicians said to Far'oh, “This is God's finger.” \add But Far'oh was stubborn\add* and he didn't listen to them, just as Yahweh had said \add previously\add*.\x + \xo 8:19: \xt Luk 11:20.\x*
\s1 Plague 4: The swarm
\rem /s1 The Fourth Plague: Flies; A Plague of Flies; The Plague of Flies
\p
\v 20 Then Yahweh said to Mosheh, “Get up early in the morning and \add when you see Far'oh¦28953\add* coming down to the river, station yourself in front¦28962 of \add him\add* and tell him, ‘Yahweh saw that you \add must\add* let my people go \add so \add* they can serve me.
\v 21 Certainly if you don't release my people immediately, then take note: I'm about to send the swarm\f + \fr 8:21 \ft The Hebrew word ‘עָרֹב’ (ˊārov) probably meaning ‘mixture’ is sometimes translated as ‘swarm’. This plague could have been anything from flies to other insects (hornets or mosquitoes???) all the way to a mixture of wild animals.\f* at you and your servants and at your people and into your houses. The Egyptians' houses will be full of the swarm and even the ground that they're on.
\v 22 \add But when it happens,\add* I'll distinguish the Goshen region where my people live so the swarm won't¦28981 be there, \add so that you'll be able to see\add* that I'm Yahweh¦28989 \add and I'm right here\add* in this land.
\v 23 This sign will happen tomorrow and¦29007 \add you'll see how I plan to set my people free\add* from your people.’ ”
\v 24 \add So\add* Yahweh¦29021 did \add what he'd said¦29015\add* and a heavy swarm came to Far'oh's house and the houses of his servants and all the Egyptians—the country was ruined by the \add arrival\add* of the swarm.
\p
\v 25 Then Far'oh¦29046 called for Mosheh¦29035 and to Aharon and told \add them\add*, “Go and sacrifice¦29061 to the god of you¦29039 all, \add but here in Egypt\add*.”
\p
\v 26 “It wouldn't be right to do that,” Mosheh¦29066 \add ≈replied\add*, “because our sacrifices to Yahweh¦29072 our god \add would be offensive\add* to Egyptians. Listen, if we made sacrifices in front of the Egyptians \add that are repulsive to them\add*, wouldn't they \add throw rocks at us to try to kill us\add*?
\v 27 We need to travel into the wilderness for three days, then we'll sacrifice to our god Yahweh¦29076 \add there\add*, just like he's telling us to.”
\p
\v 28 \add So\add* Far'oh¦29090 \add relented\add*, “I'll let you all go into the wilderness and sacrifice to Yahweh your god—except you definitely can't¦29097 go very far. \add Now,\add* ask God for me \add for the plague to stop\add*.”
\p
\v 29 “Listen, I'm about to \add leave now\add*,” Mosheh \add ≈responded\add*, “and I'll pray to Yahweh and he'll withdraw the swarm from Far'oh tomorrow, and from his servants and his people. \add But\add* may Far'oh not be dishonest \add again and\add* fail to let our people go to sacrifice to Yahweh.”
\p
\v 30 Then Mosheh left Far'oh and prayed to Yahweh
\v 31 and Yahweh did \add what\add* Mosheh \add asked him\add* and he withdrew the swarm from Far'oh, and from his servants and his people. Not one remained.
\v 32 \add But\add* Far'oh \add changed his mind and remained stubborn and he wouldn't let the Israelis leave\add*.

\s1 Plague 5: The stock disease
\rem /s2 Death of the Animals
\rem /s1 The Fifth Plague: Livestock Diseased; The Plague on Livestock; A Plague against Livestock
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Mosheh¦29108, “Go in to Far'oh¦29112 and tell him: ‘This is what the god¦29119 of the Hebrews¦29120. Yahweh, says: Let my people¦29124 go \add so\add* they can serve me.
\v 2 Certainly if you're¦29133 unwilling to release them and if you keep holding onto them,
\v 3 then listen. Yahweh¦29140 is about¦29141 to \add inflict\add* a very serious plague on your¦29142 livestock¦29142 which¦29143 are in the fields¦29144—on the horses¦29145, the donkeys¦29146, the camels¦29147, the cattle, and on the flock¦29149.
\v 4 \add But¦29154\add* Yahweh¦29155 will distinguish¦29154 between the livestock of the Israelis and the Egyptians—none of the Israelis' animals will die¦29163.’ ”
\v 5 Then¦29170 Yahweh \add said when it would happen\add*, “Yahweh will do this \add to Egypt\add* tomorrow¦29174.”
\p
\v 6 \add So¦29181\add* the next day¦29187 Yahweh¦29182 did \add what he'd said\add* and all of the livestock of the Egyptians¦29191 died, yet none at all from the livestock of the Israelis¦29195 died.
\v 7 Far'oh sent \add people to investigate\add*, and wow, not even one of the livestock¦29207 of the Israelis¦29208 had died. \add But¦29201\add* Far'oh was strong-willed and wouldn't let the people go.
\s1 Plague 6: Boils
\rem /s1 The Plague of Boils; The Sixth Plague: Boils; A Plague of Boils
\p
\v 8 Then Yahweh¦29223 told Mosheh and Aharon¦29229, “Take handfuls of ash out of a furnace, then Mosheh should \add toss it up in the air in front\add* of Far'oh¦29240.
\v 9 It will become a powder over all Egypt and then it will turn into boils¦29256—bursting blisters¦29258—on people and on animals all over Egypt.”
\v 10 \add So¦29264\add* they took¦29264 some ash from a furnace, and standing in front¦29270 of Far'oh¦29271, Mosheh¦29274 \add tossed it up into the air\add* and it turned into boils with bursting blisters¦29278 on the people and the animals.\x + \xo 9:10: \xt Rev 16:2.\x*
\v 11 Because of the boils, the sorcerers weren't \add even\add* able to stand¦29287 \add there with\add* Mosheh¦29289 because the sorcerers \add suffered with them\add* along with all the Egyptians.
\v 12 \add But¦29301\add* Yahweh caused Far'oh¦29306 to remain stubborn and he didn't¦29307 listen¦29308 to them, just as Yahweh had told Mosheh¦29315 \add previously\add*.
\s1 Plague 7: Hail
\rem /s1 A Plague of Hail; The Seventh Plague: Thunder and Hail; The Plague of Hail

\v 13 Then Yahweh told Mosheh¦29322, “Get up early¦29323 in the morning¦29324, and stand in front¦29326 of Far'oh¦29327 and say¦29328 to him, ‘This is what Yahweh, the god¦29334 of the Hebrews¦29335, says¦29332: Let my people¦29339 go¦29336 so they can serve me
\v 14 because this time¦29344, I'm about¦29347 to send¦29347 all my plagues¦29352 to you and your servants, and your people¦29357. \add You'll all be deeply distressed by them\add*, in order that you might know¦29359 that there¦29361 is no \add one else\add* like me in all the world.
\v 15 \add By this time\add*, I could have reached out and struck¦29373 you and your people¦29377 with such a plague¦29378 that you would all have been obliterated from the land.
\v 16 However, I've kept you for this reason: to show you my power¦29392 and in order to proclaim my name¦29395 all over the world.\x + \xo 9:16: \xt Rom 9:17.\x*
\v 17 You're still considering yourself¦29401 to be greater than my people¦29402 by failing to release them.
\v 18 \add Now\add* listen: I'm about¦29407 to cause extremely heavy¦29411 hail to rain \add down\add* at this time¦29408 tomorrow¦29409. \add It'll be hail like\add* which¦29413 has never been \add seen before\add* in Egypt¦29418 from the day¦29421 it was founded¦29422 until now.
\v 19 \add So¦29427\add* send¦29428 for your livestock¦29432 and everything you own in the country now, and bring¦29429 it in under cover because the hail will come down on every person and animal¦29442 that¦29443 is found¦29445 in the countryside¦29438 and not \add sheltering under a roof\add*, and they will die¦29453.’ ”
\v 20 Some of Far'oh's servants¦29465 who believed what Yahweh¦29459 said, quickly brought their slaves and their livestock¦29468 back into their houses¦29471,
\v 21 but those \add people\add* who didn't¦29474 believe Yahweh¦29481 \add just\add* left their slaves and their animals out in the countryside¦29489.
\p
\v 22 “Raise your¦29500 arm up toward the sky,” Yahweh¦29493 told Mosheh¦29496, “and hail \add will strike\add* all over Egypt¦29509—on the people and animals and on every plant in the Egyptian countryside¦29520.”
\v 23 \add So¦29524\add* Mosheh¦29525 lifted his staff¦29528 to the sky, and Yahweh sent thunder¦29534 and hail, and \add lightning caused fires\add* on the land, and \add so\add* Yahweh rained¦29539 hail \add down\add* onto Egypt¦29545.
\v 24 There was hail, and \add also\add* fire¦29549 coming \add down\add* in the middle¦29551 of the hail. It was very heavy¦29553, such as had never been in all of Egypt¦29563 since¦29564 it became a nation¦29566.\x + \xo 9:24: \xt Rev 8:7; 16:21.\x*
\v 25 The hail struck everything in Egypt¦29573—everything that was in the countryside, from people to animals. \add It also\add* struck every plant and broke every tree¦29594 \add out\add* in the countryside.
\v 26 Only in the Goshen¦29600 region where¦29601 the Israelis¦29605 were, was there¦29603 no hail.
\p
\v 27 Then¦29610 Far'oh¦29611 sent¦29610 for Mosheh¦29613 and Aharon¦29614 and told them, “I've sinned¦29617 this time¦29618. Yahweh¦29619 is righteous¦29620, and me and my people¦29622 are guilty.
\v 28 Pray to Yahweh¦29628 \add to stop it,\add* because the thunder¦29631 of God¦29632 and hail are too much. Then I'll release you all—you won't¦29636 have to remain \add here\add*.”
\p
\v 29 “As I'm leaving the city¦29646,” Mosheh¦29642 \add ≈replied\add*, “I'll spread¦29647 my palms \add out\add* to Yahweh. The thunder¦29654 will stop and the hail won't¦29657 continue so that you¦29662 \add will be able to see\add* that the earth¦29665 belongs to Yahweh.

\v 31 (\add Now¦29680\add* the flax and the barley were \add flattened by the hail\add* because the barley was \add full grown and starting to fill out\add* and the flax was in bloom.
\v 32 But¦29690 the wheat¦29686 and the spelt¦29687 weren't \add destroyed because they come later in the season\add*.)

\v 5 They'll cover¦29837 the ground so that no one will \add even\add* be able to see it, and they'll devour whatever remains¦29852 after the hail. Plus they'll devour every¦29862 tree¦29864 growing¦29865 in the countryside¦29869.
\v 6 They'll fill your houses and the houses of all your servants¦29876 and the houses of all the Egyptians. It'll be nothing like anything which¦29881 your \add parents generation\add* ever saw, nor anything seen by the \add previous generations\add* from the day they came to be on the earth until¦29893 today.” Then¦29871 \add Mosheh\add* turned¦29896 around and went¦29889 out from Far'oh¦29899 \add with Aharon\add*.

The text here implies that it's possible that the Hebrew word translated ‘unleavened’ really meant ‘unrisen’ on that first ‘pass-over’ night.\f* because they were driven¦31319 out of Egypt \add ≈in a hurry\add* and hadn't \add ≈had time to prepare food to take\add*.

\v 17 When Far'oh¦31803 released the people, God¦31810 didn't¦31807 lead them through the land of the Philistines¦31813, although \add @that way\add* was shorter, because \add *he\add* said, “\add ≈It's best if the people don't¦31807 have to face¦31825 war immediately, or they might change their minds\add* and \add then want to\add* return¦31827 to Egypt¦31828.”
\v 18 \add So¦31830\add* God¦31831 caused the people to take the path¦31836 going towards the wilderness¦31837 and the Red Sea.\f + \fr 13:18 \ft Probably towards the \em Gulf of Suez\em*: see https://armstronginstitute.org/339-where-did-the-red-sea-crossing-take-place.\f* The Israeli left Egypt¦31847 \add ≈in formation as if ready for battle¦31841\add*.
\p
\v 19 Mosheh¦31850 \add ensured that\add* the bones of Yosef were taken with \add them\add*, because \add many years back\add* \add @Yosef\add* had made the Israelis¦31862 vow, saying, “God¦31866 will certainly take notice of you all, and¦31868 you must take my bones up with you from here.”\x + \xo 13:19: \xt Gen 50:25; Josh 24:32.\x*
\p
\v 20 The people travelled on from Succoth¦31876 and¦31877 camped¦31877 at Etham¦31878 on the edge of the wilderness¦31880.
\v 21 During the day, Yahweh¦31882 went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud¦31887 to lead them on the way, and at nighttime, he went in a pillar of fire to be light¦31893 to them, \add so they could travel both\add* in the daytime and at night.
\v 22 The daytime pillar of cloud¦31903 and¦31905 the nighttime¦31907 pillar of fire¦31906 didn't ever leave their place in front¦31908 of the people¦31909.

\v 1 Then Yahweh¦31913 told Mosheh¦31916,
\v 2 “Tell the Israelis¦31923 that they should turn and camp in front of Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol¦31930 and the sea, in front of Baal-Zephon¦31935. You all are to camp by the sea opposite¦31936 it.
\v 3 Then¦31942 Far'oh¦31943 will say, ‘They¦31945 are confused¦31946 \add and lost\add*—the wilderness¦31951 has boxed them in.’
\v 4 I'll strengthen Far'oh's \add ≈resolve\add* and he'll chase after¦31960 them. Then¦31953 because of Far'oh and all his army, I'll be \add honoured\add* and the Egyptians will know¦31966 that I am Yahweh¦31971.” \add ≈So¦31953 the Israelis camped where they¦31972 were instructed\add*.
\rem /s1 The Egyptians Pursue Israel
\p
\v 5 When the king¦31977 of Egypt¦31978 was told that the Israelis had fled, \add *he\add* and his servants \add started thinking about their own\add* people and they asked, “What have we done by letting the Israeli slaves go free?”
\v 6 Then¦32002 he¦32009 hitched up his chariot¦32005 and¦32006 took¦32009 his \add army\add* with him.
\v 7 He took¦32012 600 of the best chariots as well as all the other Egyptian chariots and officers¦32021 \add to supervise\add* them.
\v 8 Yahweh¦32027 strengthened the Egyptian¦32039 king's resolve and so Far'oh¦32031 pursued¦32034 after the Israelis¦32037 after they had confidently marched out \add of Egypt¦32033\add*.
\v 9 The Egyptians pursued them and all of Far'oh's horses¦32055 and chariots¦32056, along with his mounted soldiers and his foot army, overtook¦32047 them camping above the sea¦32052 above Pi Hahiroth, across from Baal-Zephon¦32066.
\p
\v 10 As \add the Egyptians\add* approached, the Israelis¦32073 looked back, and \add to their¦32076 horror\add*, saw the army coming after¦32081 them. They were extremely afraid¦32082 and cried¦32084 out to Yahweh¦32090.
\v 11 They \add complained\add* to Mosheh¦32095, “Is it because¦32096 there¦32097 weren't any graves¦32099 in Egypt that you brought us here to die¦32102 in the wilderness¦32103? What have you done to us? Why did you bring¦32109 us out from Egypt?
\v 12 Isn't this \add exactly what we told\add* you¦32118 in Egypt¦32119 when we said, ‘\add ≈Just leave us alone\add* and let us serve¦32123 the Egyptians’? Because serving¦32130 the Egyptians \add sounds a lot\add* better to us than dying \add out here\add* in the wilderness¦32135.”
\p
\v 13 Then¦32137 Mosheh¦32138 told the people¦32141, “You mustn't be afraid¦32144. Stand still and see how Yahweh¦32150 saves you all—he's going to do it today, because any Egyptians that¦32151 you see today, you'll never, ever see them again¦32166.
\v 14 Yahweh¦32171 himself will fight¦32172 for you all—all you need to do is to remain calm.”
\rem /s1 Escape through the Red Sea
\v 15 Then Yahweh¦32179 \add scolded\add* Mosheh¦32182, “Why are you¦32185 \add still here\add* crying¦32185 out to me? Talk to the Israelis¦32192 and get them moving forward¦32193.
\v 16 As for you, raise¦32196 your staff¦32199 and stretch¦32200 your arm out over the sea and divide¦32207 it. Then¦32195 the Israelis¦32211 will go on onto dry ground¦32214 through the middle¦32212 of the sea.
\v 17 \add Yes, watch me!\add* I'll strengthen the resolve of the Egyptians and they'll enter \add between the sea\add* after¦32224 them. Then¦32216 I'll be honoured because of \add what will happen to\add* Far'oh¦32226 and all his army, and his chariots¦32230 and his horsemen¦32231.
\v 18 \add Because of that,\add* the Egyptians will know¦32233 that I'm Yahweh¦32238.”
\p
\v 19 Then¦32244 God's messenger¦32245 who travelled ahead of the Israelis¦32250, moved and went¦32251 behind them. \add Also\add* the pillar¦32254 of cloud¦32255 moved from in front¦32248 of them and stood¦32257 behind them
\v 20 and \add so\add* it was then between the \add coming\add* Egyptians and the Israelis¦32267. Then¦32260 the cloud¦32269 became darkness¦32270 \add on the Egyptian side\add*, \add yet it lit up the other side\add*, and no one could approach it all night.
\v 21 Then¦32286 Mosheh¦32287 stretched¦32286 his arm out over the sea and Yahweh¦32295 sent a strong¦32302 east wind. It blew all night¦32305 and divided¦32311 the sea \add on each side\add* and dried the \add strip of\add* land in the middle.
\v 22 \add So¦32314\add* then the Israelis¦32317 entered through the middle¦32318 of the sea¦32319 on dry ground¦32320 with a wall of water¦32321 on each side of them.\x + \xo 14:22: \xt 1Cor 10:1-2; Heb 11:29.\x*
\v 23 \add However,\add* the Egyptians pursued¦32327 after¦32330 them. Every one of Far'oh's horses and chariots¦32334 and his horsemen \add also\add* entered into the middle¦32338 of the sea¦32339.
\v 24 \add By now morning¦32343 was coming\add* and Yahweh¦32345 looked¦32344 down through the pillar¦32350 of fire¦32351 and cloud¦32352, and he caused confusion for the Egyptian army.
\v 25 He caused¦32358 the wheels¦32360 of their¦32361 chariots¦32361 to turn unevenly \add so they became difficult¦32363\add* to drive, and the Egyptians \add complained\add*, “Let's retreat from \add following\add* the Israelis¦32367, because Yahweh¦32370 is fighting¦32371 against Egypt¦32365 and for them.”
\rem /s1 The Pursuers Drowned
\p
\v 26 \add On the other side,\add* Yahweh¦32377 told Mosheh¦32380, “Stretch your¦32384 arm out over the sea¦32387 and the waters¦32389 will \add flow back\add* onto the Egyptians and onto \add @Far'oh's\add* chariots¦32395 and his horsemen¦32398.”
\v 27 \add So¦32400\add* Mosheh¦32401 stretched¦32400 his arm out over the sea, and as the day broke, the sea began to return¦32408 to its normal¦32412 place. The Egyptians \add turned and\add* fled before¦32415 its impact \add but\add* Yahweh¦32417 shook the Egyptians \add off their horses and chariots\add* in the middle¦32421 of the sea.
\v 28 \add So¦32424\add* the sea returned¦32424 and covered¦32426 the chariots¦32429 and the horsemen¦32432—even Far'oh's entire army that had entered into the sea after¦32437 \add @the Israelis\add*. Not even one of \add @the pursuers\add* remained¦32441.
\v 29 \add But¦32447\add* the Israelis¦32448 had walked¦32449 through the middle¦32451 of the sea¦32452 on dry land with a wall of water¦32453 on each side of them.
\p
\v 30 \add So\add* Yahweh¦32460 saved¦32459 Yisrael¦32465 from Egypt's¦32467 power that day¦32461, and the Israelis saw¦32468 the Egyptians' bodies \add washed up\add* on the shore¦32476.
\v 31 \add All of\add* Yisrael¦32480 saw¦32479 the \add ≈incredible power¦32483\add* that¦32485 Yahweh had used against the Egyptians, and the people¦32490 revered Yahweh, and put their trust in him and his servant¦32497 Mosheh¦32496.

\q1 “I will sing to Yahweh because he's been so successful—

\v 3 Yahweh is a warrior.

\v 7 You toss away your adversaries¦32576 with your great¦32573 power.

\q1
\v 9 Our enemies thought that they could chase after us and overtake¦32600 us.

\q1

\q1 Who else is so powerful and yet sinless,

\q1
\v 12 You stretched¦32633 out your¦32634 powerful arm.

\q1
\v 13 You are leading the people¦32640 you bought back,

\p
\v 20 Then Aharon's sister¦32737 Miryam who was a prophetess¦32736, picked up a tambourine¦32741 and went¦32743 outside. All the other women¦32746 did likewise and followed her¦32742 out to dance together

\s1 The bitter water
\rem /s1 Bitter Water; In the wilderness; The Waters of Marah and Elim; Bitter Water Made Sweet; Bitter Water at Marah
\p
\v 22 Then Mosheh¦32767 lead the Israelis away from the Red Sea and they moved into the wilderness at Shur¦32779. They went through the wilderness for three¦32781 days¦32783 and \add finally\add* found¦32787 some water¦32788,
\v 23 but it was so bitter that they couldn't drink¦32794 it. So¦32790 they named that place ‘Marah’ \add (which means ‘bitter’)\add*,
\v 24 and the people¦32809 grumbled¦32808 about Mosheh¦32812 saying¦32813, “\add So¦32808\add* what will we¦32816 drink¦32816 \add then\add*?”
\v 25 \add So¦32818\add* Mosheh cried¦32818 out to Yahweh, and Yahweh showed¦32822 him a tree¦32824. When he threw¦32825 it into the water, the water became¦32829 \add safe to drink\add*.
\p \add @Yahweh\add* made a statue at that place, and a rule, and he tested¦32837 \add @Mosheh\add* there,

\p
\v 27 \add Then they moved on\add* and came¦32874 to Elim¦32875 where there were twelve springs¦32879 and seventy¦32881 palm trees¦32882, and they camped¦32883 there by the water¦32880.

\rem /s1 Manna and Quail; Manna and Quail from Heaven; Bread from Heaven; The Manna and the Quails
\p
\v 1 Then¦32890 they left Elim, and all the Israelis¦32898 entered into the wilderness¦32901 at Siyn (between Elim and Sinai¦32909) \add ≈around six weeks\add* after¦32915 leaving Egypt¦32917,
\v 2 and all the Israelis¦32926 murmured against¦32930 Mosheh¦32929 and Aharon¦32932 \add there\add* in the wilderness¦32933,
\v 3 saying, “If¦32938 only \add ≈Yahweh¦32945 had killed us\add* in Egypt¦32947, \add where we'd be\add* sitting by a pot of meat eating bread until we're full, because you've brought¦32958 us out into this wilderness¦32962 to \add ≈starve us all to death\add*.”
\p
\v 4 Then Yahweh¦32975 told Mosheh¦32978, “\add Just\add* watch me make food rain down from the sky for you all. Then the people¦32987 will be able to go out every day and gather¦32988 enough for that day so that I can test them: Will they obey my law or not?\x + \xo 16:4: \xt Yhn 6:31.\x*
\v 5 \add ≈But¦33001 every Friday¦33005\add* they can \add gather and\add* prepare¦33004 twice as much as what they gather on the other days.”
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* Mosheh¦33021 and Aharon¦33022 told all the Israelis¦33028, “This evening¦33029 you'll all know¦33030 that Yahweh¦33032 was the one who brought¦33033 you out from Egypt¦33036.
\v 7 In the morning¦33038 you'll all see¦33039 Yahweh's greatness as he's heard¦33044 your¦33047 murmurings against \add *him\add*. \add I mean,\add* who are we¦33051 that you'd murmur against \em us\em*?”
\v 8 Then¦33058 Mosheh¦33059 continued¦33058, “So¦33058 Yahweh will give¦33060 you all meat to eat in the evening¦33063 and enough bread¦33066 in the morning¦33067 to make you all full. \add Yes,\add* Yahweh has heard¦33069 your murmurings against him. As for us, \add ≈we're insignificant\add*. Your murmuring isn't¦33081 against us, but against Yahweh.”
\p
\v 9 Then¦33090 Mosheh¦33091 told Aharon¦33094, “Summon¦33102 everyone¦33101 to come and face¦33104 Yahweh¦33105, because he's heard¦33107 their murmurings.”
\v 10 And so while Aharon¦33113 spoke to all the Israelis¦33121, they turned toward the wilderness¦33125, and wow, Yahweh's¦33128 \add dazzling brightness\add* appeared¦33129 in the cloud¦33130!
\v 11 Then Yahweh¦33134 told Mosheh¦33137,
\v 12 “I've heard¦33140 the murmurings of the Israelis¦33145. Speak to them saying, ‘In the evenings, you'll all eat meat, and in the mornings¦33153 you'll all be satisfied¦33154 with bread¦33156. Then you'll all know that I'm your god¦33161, Yahweh¦33160.’ ”
\p
\v 13 And so that evening¦33164, quail¦33166 appeared and covered¦33167 the camp. And in the morning¦33171, \add something like\add* dew was lying all around¦33175 the camp,
\v 14 and when it evaporated, wow, it left behind thin flakes¦33187—thin like frost¦33189 on the ground there in the wilderness¦33185.
\v 15 \add When\add* the Israelis¦33197 saw¦33194 it, \add ≈they asked each other\add*, ‘What is it?’ because they didn't¦33206 know what it was.
\p And Mosheh¦33212 told them, “It's the food that¦33216 Yahweh¦33218 has given¦33217 you all to eat.\x + \xo 16:15: \xt 1Cor 10:3.\x*
\v 16 \add ≈These are Yahweh's¦33226 instructions\add*: Gather enough of it according to how many people you're feeding—about two litres per person¦33235 who lives in your¦33235 tents.”
\p
\v 17 \add So¦33241\add* the Israelis¦33245 went ahead and gathered¦33246 it—some collecting a lot, and others, less,
\v 18 \add but\add* when they measured¦33250 it out, those who'd collected a lot didn't¦33252 have any extra, and those who hadn't gathered so much still had enough to eat—each person had gathered just enough.\x + \xo 16:18: \xt 2Cor 8:15.\x*
\v 19 Then¦33264 Mosheh¦33265 told them, “Don't save any of it for tomorrow,”
\v 20 \add but some of\add* them didn't¦33276 take any notice of him and kept it until¦33285 the next morning¦33287. However, by then it was full of maggots and smelt rotten, and Mosheh was very angry¦33291 at them.
\p
\v 21 \add So¦33296 from that day onwards,\add* they gathered¦33295 it every¦33299 morning, depending on how many they were feeding, and then when the sun¦33303 got hot, \add @the rest\add* melted¦33304 \add away\add*.
\v 22 On the \add ≈Friday\add*, they gathered¦33310 twice as much—around \add four litres\add* for each person—and all the leaders of the community came¦33316 and informed Mosheh
\v 23 and he told them, “This is what Yahweh said: Tomorrow is a rest day to be set aside for Yahweh. \add ≈So¦33324 bake or cook your food, and keep the left-overs overnight to use in\add* the morning¦33355.”\x + \xo 16:23: \xt Exo 20:8-11.\x*
\v 24 \add So¦33358\add* they did what Mosheh¦33364 had told them and kept the left-overs until¦33359 the morning¦33361, and it didn't¦33365 stink or have any bugs in it.
\v 25 On that Saturday morning, Mosheh¦33374 told them, “Go ahead and eat¦33375 the previously cooked food because today is set aside for Yahweh¦33381 and so you all won't¦33383 find any more \add on the ground\add*—
\v 26 you'll gather¦33389 it for six days¦33388 \add each week\add*, but on the Saturday, there won't¦33393 be any.”
\p
\v 27 \add However,\add* some people¦33404 did go out to collect it, but they couldn't find any,
\v 28 and Yahweh¦33411 said¦33410 to Mosheh¦33414, “For how long will you¦33418 all keep refusing¦33418 to obey my commands¦33420 and my laws?
\v 29 Listen, Yahweh¦33426 has given¦33427 you the Rest Day, so on the Friday he gives you food for two¦33439 days¦33439. On the Saturday, everyone¦33442 should¦33446 stay where they are—there's no need for anyone¦33447 to go¦33446 outside \add searching\add*.”
\v 30 So¦33452 the people¦33453 didn't work on the Saturday.

\v 31 The Israelis¦33460 named it ‘manna¦33464’ \add (which sounds like Hebrew ‘What is it?’)\add*. It was white¦33468 like coriander¦33467 seed, and it tasted¦33469 like wafers¦33470 with honey¦33471.\x + \xo 16:31: \xt Num 11:7-8.\x*

\v 1 Then all the Israelis¦33574 moved on from Siyn in the wilderness¦33575, travelling following Yahweh's¦33582 instructions. They camped¦33583 at Refidim¦33584 \add but\add* there¦33585 was no water¦33586 for the people to drink¦33587.\x + \xo 17:1-7: \xt Num 20:2-13.\x*

\v 2 (Yetro had \add been looking after\add* Mosheh's wife¦33901 Zipporah¦33900 \add and their two sons\add* after he had sent¦33904 her¦33904 back\x + \xo 18:2-3: \xt Exo 2:21-22.\x*

\v 5 \add So¦33932 now\add* Mosheh's father-in-law¦33934 brought \add @Mosheh's\add* wife and sons¦33936 to the wilderness¦33943 where¦33944 \add #the people\add* were camping \add near\add* the mountain¦33949 of God¦33950.

\p
\v 15 “Because¦34140 the people¦34144 come to me to \add ≈find out what God¦34146 wants for them\add*,” Mosheh¦34138 replied to \add @Yetro\add*.
\v 16 “When a \add difficult\add* situation comes up among them, someone comes to me and I make the judgement between a man and his neighbour¦34159. \add In addition,\add* I help them understand the god's statutes¦34163 and laws.”
\p
\v 17 “It's not a good¦34175 \add idea\add* what you're¦34178 doing¦34179,” said¦34169 Yetro.
\v 18 “You're¦34192 definitely \add on the road to\add* wear yourself out, plus you'll also wear out these people¦34188 who are with you, because the \add responsibility\add* is too heavy¦34194 for you—you can't¦34197 \add just\add* do it¦34200 alone.
\v 19 Now, listen¦34204 to \add this\add*: I'll advise you and God will be with you. You be before God for the people¦34212, and you should¦34207 bring¦34215 their disputes to God yourself.

\v 21 \add But¦34245\add* you yourself should search through all the people¦34249 to find capable men who are godly and faithful¦34256, and not \add greedy for\add* dishonest profit.

\v 3 Yahweh¦34418 called¦34416 Mosheh¦34411 from the mountain¦34421, so he climbed up and God¦34415 gave him this message and asked him to pass it on to Yacob's¦34426 descendants, the Israelis¦34429:

\v 3 Put \add @the baking\add* into a basket, and bring¦39377 the basket \add to me\add* along with the bull¦39382 and two¦39384 rams.
\p
\v 4 Then¦39387 take Aharon¦39389 and his sons¦39392 near to the entrance¦39396 of the sacred tent and wash them with water¦39401.
\v 5 Take the clothes and dress Aharon¦39410 in the tunic¦39413 and the robe¦39415 that goes with the apron, then the sacred apron and the sacred pouch, and tie the waistband around the apron.
\v 6 Put¦39434 the turban on his head and¦39433 attach the sacred¦39437 \add gold\add* ornament to it,
\v 7 then take¦39442 the anointing¦39446 oil and pour it over his head to dedicate him.
\v 8 \add Next,\add* bring¦39457 his sons¦39456 and¦39458 put tunics¦39459 on them
\v 9 and wrap waistbands around them and tie on their headbands. They¦39462 \add and their descendants\add* will be priests¦39471 forever, and you must ordain¦39474 \add both\add* Aharon¦39464 and his sons.
\p
\v 10 Then¦39482 bring¦39482 the bull to the front¦39486 of the sacred tent and get Aharon¦39490 and his sons to put their¦39494 hands¦39494 on its head,
\v 11 then slaughter¦39500\f + \fr 29:11 \ft The throat will be cut with a sharp knife, and the blood will be caught in a bowl.\f* the bull¦39503 before \add *me\add* at the entrance¦39506 of the sacred tent.

\v 13 Take all the fat covering¦39536 the innards including the lobe above the liver¦39544, as well as both kidneys¦39547 and the fat on them, and burn¦39553 it all on the altar¦39554,

\v 15 Then¦39573 take¦39577 one of the rams and have Aharon¦39579 and his sons¦39580 place their¦39583 hands¦39583 on \add *its\add* head,
\v 16 then slaughter¦39589 it. \add Catch\add* the blood¦39596 and sprinkle¦39597 it all over \add the sides of\add* the altar¦39600.

\p
\v 22 Take the fat of \add that second\add* ram, and its fat tail, the fat covering¦39730 its innards and the lobe above the liver¦39736, the two¦39739 kidneys¦39740 and that fat that's on them, and the right¦39748 thigh¦39747, \add because\add* this ram is for consecration.

\v 24 Put¦39781 all those into the hands of Aharon¦39773 and his sons¦39776, and \add they\add* must wave them before \add *me\add* as a wave offering.
\v 25 Then¦39783 take¦39783 them from their¦39785 hands¦39785 and burn¦39786 them completely on the altar¦39787 on top of the burnt¦39790 offering. That also will be a fire¦39795 offering to \add *me\add*, and its aroma¦39791 will please \add *me\add*.
\p
\v 26 Take¦39811 the breast¦39802 meat of the ram (\add the second one\add* for the consecration of Aharon¦39806) and wave it as a wave offering before \add *me\add*. Then¦39799 after that¦39805 it will be your share \add to cook and eat\add*.

\v 28 Those will belong to Aharon¦39836 and his sons¦39837 as their regular portion¦39838 from the Israelis—it will be a contribution from the Israelis from their peace offerings to \add *me\add*.

\v 29 The¦39870 sacred¦39859 clothes that¦39860 belong¦39862 to Aharon¦39861 will be used for his male descendants to wear \add in turn\add* when they're anointed¦39865 and consecrated.

\p
\v 31 Take the ram of consecration and¦39893 boil its¦39896 meat in a sacred¦39898 place¦39897,
\v 32 then Aharon¦39901 and his sons¦39902 should eat the meat of the ram as well as the breads¦39909 that¦39910 are in the basket¦39911 at the entrance¦39912 to the tent.
\v 33 They must eat those things¦39933 used to make atonement¦39919 for them and to consecrate¦39925 them. No one else can eat them, because they've been made sacred¦39933.
\v 34 If¦39948 any meat of the consecration or any of the bread¦39943 remains until¦39944 the morning¦39946, then you must burn¦39947 the remainder—it can't¦39952 be eaten¦39953 because it's been made sacred¦39956.
\p
\v 35 \add So¦39959\add* that's what you must do for Aharon¦39960 and his sons¦39961, just like I've commanded¦39966 you. You'll consecrate them for seven¦39968 days¦39969,
\v 36 and each day you must sacrifice a bull¦39973 to purify¦39980 the altar and compensate for the altar's imperfections. You¦39987 must also anoint¦39986 it \add each day with olive oil\add* to make it sacred.
\v 37 After¦39997 making atonement¦39992 for the altar and making it sacred for seven days¦39991, it will then be so sacred that anything that touches¦40004 it will also become sacred.

\v 21 They tied the rings on the sacred pouch to the rings on the sacred apron with a blue cord, so that the sacred pouch was above the waistband and¦45214 would not come loose from the apron. They did these things exactly as Yahweh¦45222 had instructed¦45221 Mosheh¦45225 \add <to do\add*.

\v 22 \add @Bezalel\add* had a weaver¦45233 make the robe¦45230 \add that would be worn under\add* the sacred apron entirely¦45234 from blue \add material\add*.
\v 23 It opened down the middle like other clothes and had a border around¦45245 this opening so that it wouldn't tear,
\v 24 and the bottom hem had \add decorative\add* pomegranates¦45254 on it that were made from blue, purple¦45256, and scarlet yarn.
\v 25 They¦45266 \add also\add* made \add small\add* bells from pure gold¦45263 and¦45265 attached them between the pomegranates around¦45275 the bottom of the robe¦45274,
\v 26 so it alternated between a bell and a pomegranate going around¦45287 the hem, just as Yahweh¦45291 had instructed¦45290 Mosheh¦45294.
\p
\v 27 A weaver¦45303 made tunics¦45300 for Aaron¦45304 and his sons¦45305 from fine linen¦45301,
\v 28 along with the turban¦45308 and caps from fine linen, the underwear¦45317 made from twisted¦45320 finely-spun linen,
\v 29 and the waistband from fine linen¦45325 with blue, purple¦45328, and scarlet embroidery, just as Yahweh¦45335 had instructed¦45334 Mosheh¦45338.
\p
\v 30 They made a \add decorative\add* plate¦45344 (to represent a holy crown¦45345) from pure¦45347 gold¦45348 and they¦45341 engraved¦45353 ‘Dedicated to Yahweh¦45356’ on it (like you'd do for a signet ring).
\v 31 They¦45370 put a blue cord on it to attach it to the front of the turban¦45365, just as Yahweh¦45369 had instructed¦45368 Mosheh¦45372.

\s1 Erecting the sacred tent

\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh¦45596 told Mosheh¦45599,
\v 2 “On¦45609 the first day¦45602 of the first month, you¦45608 should set-up the tent \add ≈where we'll meet\add*.
\v 3 Put the box¦45618 for the transcript¦45619 slabs in its place and¦45620 \add hang\add* the curtain¦45626 to screen¦45620 it \add from sight\add*.
\v 4 Then¦45628 bring in the \add bread\add* table¦45631 and arrange¦45632 its utensils, and bring in the lampstand and set up the lamps,
\v 5 and put the gold¦45649 incense¦45650 altar¦45648 in front¦45651 of the sacred box¦45652 and set-up the entrance¦45658 curtain for the tent.
\v 6 Put¦45662 the altar¦45663 for burning sacrifices in front¦45665 of the entrance¦45666 to the sacred¦45667 tent¦45667 \add ≈where we'll meet\add*.
\v 7 Put¦45673 the washbasin between the sacred tent and that altar¦45681, and fill it with water¦45684.
\v 8 \add ≈Set-up the curtains around¦45690 the outside to make the courtyard, and¦45691 also set-up the courtyard's entrance curtain\add*.
\p
\v 9 Then¦45698 take¦45698 the \add sacred\add* anointing¦45702 oil and \add ≈smear\add* it on the sacred tent¦45706 and everything that's in it, then \add ≈none of those things¦45722 should be touched by others\add*—it will \add all\add* be sacred.
\v 10 \add ≈Also\add* anoint¦45724 the altar for burnt¦45728 offerings¦45728 and all its¦45733 utensils¦45733. After that, the altar \add ≈shouldn't be touched by others\add*—it¦45738 will be \em very\em* sacred.
\v 11 Anoint the washbasin and its¦45749 base, and then \add ≈prohibit others from using\add* it.
\p
\v 12 \add ≈Now\add* bring¦45753 Aharon¦45756 and his sons¦45759 to the entrance¦45762 of the sacred tent and wash them with water¦45767.
\v 13 Then¦45769 put the sacred garments¦45774 on Aharon¦45772 and anoint¦45776 him and make him sacred, so he can \add now\add* serve¦45780 as a priest to me.
\v 14 \add ≈Also\add* bring¦45786 his sons¦45785 and¦45787 dress them in tunics¦45789
\v 15 and anoint them like you¦45794 anointed their father¦45797, and they will serve¦45798 as priests to me. Their anointing will cause them to be a priesthood forever throughout¦45806 their generations¦45806.”
\p
\v 16 \add ≈So¦45814\add* Mosheh¦45809 did \add everything¦45810\add* that Yahweh¦45813 had instructed¦45812 him \add <to do\add*.
\v 17 It was the first day of the first month of \add their\add* second¦45823 year¦45822 when they set-up the sacred¦45827 tent¦45827.
\v 18 Mosheh¦45830 set-up the residence by setting out its bases¦45837 and standing up the frames¦45841 with their bars, and the pillars¦45849.
\v 19 He¦45870 spread¦45851 the \add ≈two tarpaulin layers\add* over the tent just as Yahweh¦45867 had instructed¦45866 \add *him\add*.
\v 20 Then he took¦45873 the \add two stone slabs with the\add* transcript¦45877 and put \add #them\add* into the box. He put the poles¦45884 \add into the rings\add* on the box and fitted the atonement platform on the top of the box \add as a lid\add*,
\v 21 and brought¦45897 the box into the residence. He¦45917 set-up the curtain¦45906 to conceal the box with the transcript¦45911, just as Yahweh¦45914 had instructed¦45913 \add *him\add*.
\p
\v 22 He¦45921 put the table¦45923 into the sacred¦45928 tent¦45928 on the north¦45929 side of the residence, outside¦45930 the curtain¦45931,
\v 23 and arranged¦45933 the bread¦45936 on it \add ≈to display it to\add* Yahweh, just as Yahweh had instructed¦45940 \add *him\add*.
\v 24 He¦45948 put the lampstand¦45950 inside the sacred¦45957 tent¦45957 across from the table¦45954, on the south¦45958 side of the residence,
\v 25 and he placed the lamps¦45961 on it \add ≈in Yahweh's presence\add*, just as Yahweh had instructed¦45965 \add *him\add*.
\v 26 Then¦45973 he put the gold¦45976 \add incense\add* altar¦45975 inside the sacred tent in front¦45979 of the curtain¦45980 \add that screened the sacred box from view\add*,
\v 27 and burnt some fragrant incense¦45984 on it, just as Yahweh¦45988 had instructed¦45987 \add *him\add*,
\v 28 then he hung the curtain at the tent entrance¦45998.
\v 29 He¦46023 put the altar¦46002 for burning sacrifices at the gate of the sacred¦46006 tent¦46006 and offered the burnt offering and the grain¦46017 offering up on it, just as Yahweh¦46020 had instructed¦46019 \add *him\add*.
\v 30 Then¦46027 he placed the washbasin between the tent and the altar¦46035, and filled it with water¦46038
\v 31 \add so that\add* Mosheh¦46043, and Aharon¦46044 and his sons¦46045, could wash their hands¦46048 and feet¦46051 from it.
\v 32 Whenever they went into the sacred tent or whenever they went near the altar¦46061, \add first\add* they would wash themselves, just as Yahweh¦46065 had commanded¦46064 Moses¦46068.
\v 33 He erected the courtyard \add curtains\add* around¦46075 the residence and the altar¦46077, and he set-up the courtyard gate curtain. And \add so\add* Mosheh¦46085 finished the work.

\v 34 Then a cloud¦46092 covered¦46091 the sacred¦46102 tent¦46102 and Yahweh's¦46098 \add ≈power and bright light\add* filled¦46099 the residence\x + \xo 40:34: \xt 1Ki 8:10-11; Isa 6:4; Eze 43:4-5; Rev 15:8.\x*
\v 35 and Mosheh¦46107 was unable to enter the tent because the cloud¦46117 had settled¦46115 on it and Yahweh's¦46119 splendour had filled¦46120 the residence.
\v 36 \add From then onwards,\add* whenever the cloud¦46126 went up from over the residence, the Israelis¦46131 would \add pack their camp and\add* set out on their travels,
\v 37 but while the cloud remained, they¦46141 would stay in that place until¦46142 the cloud lifted.
\v 38 Yahweh's¦46149 cloud¦46148 would be there during the day¦46153 \add ≈but\add* it would become fire¦46154 at night¦46156, and so the Israelis¦46163 \add ≈could always see it\add*.
