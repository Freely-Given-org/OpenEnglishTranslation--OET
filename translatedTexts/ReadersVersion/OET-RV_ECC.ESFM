\mt3 (meaning ‘The group leader’)
\is1 Introduction
\ip This collection of \bk Reflections\bk* (commonly called \bk Ecclesiastes\bk*), was written by a wise leader. Some of the proverbs here were written by King Shelomoh (Solomon), but there's also proverbs from other writers. The authors of these thought carefully about the meaning of life. They looked at everything that happens here in the world (‘under the sun’) to discover its purpose and to try to understand the meaning of life. They advise that it's necessary to respect and obey Yahweh, to strive to find happiness in our daily lives. (The meaning of Ecclesiastes is ‘The group leader’. The title commonly used in English is a Latin transliteration of the Greek translation of the Hebrew word קֹהֶלֶת.) In Hebrew texts, this document is grouped in with ‘The Writings (Ketuvim)’.

\v 2 “Totally pointless,” says the leader.
\q1 “\add ≈A complete waste of time\add*. Everything's worthless.”

\v 4 \add ≈Generations come, and generations go\add*,

\v 5 The sun rises¦278429 and the sun sets,

\q1
\v 6 Going to the south¦278444 then around to the north¦278448,
\q1 the wind is going, changing, turning,

\q1
\v 7 All the rivers \add ≈flow into\add* the sea \add ≈but it never¦278468 gets\add* full.
\q1 The place¦278472 that the rivers are going to, they \add ≈end up\add* going \add there¦278475\add* again.
\q1
\v 8 Everything is wearisome¦278483—\add ≈not even worth talking about\add*.
\q1 The \add #eyes\add* \add ≈never stop\add* seeing,

\q1 There's nothing new \add ≈in this world\add*.\f + \fr 1:9 \ft ‘Under the sun’ isn't a natural English idiom\f*.

\q1
\v 12 I, the leader, was king¦278551 over Yisrael in Yerushalem¦278555.
\q1
\v 13 I \add ≈used my mind and\add* wisdom¦278563 to discover and to explore¦278562 everything that is done \add ≈in this world\add*.
\q1 It's a difficult job that God¦278576 has given¦278575 humanity¦278578 to be busy with.
\q1
\v 14 I saw all the deeds that are done \add ≈in this world\add*,
\q1 and look—everything's pointless \add like\add* chasing¦278594 after the wind¦278595.
\q1
\v 15 Something that's bent can't be straightened¦278601 \add again\add*,
\q1 ≈and¦278602 what's missing can't be counted¦278606.
\q1
\v 16 I spoke¦278608 with \add ≈sincerity\add*, saying, “Look at me—I've become \add ≈powerful\add*,
\q1 and I've \add ≈increased¦278617 in wisdom relative to everyone¦278620 who ruled before me\add* \add here\add* in Yerushalem¦278628.\x + \xo 1:16: \xt 1Ki 4:29-31.\x*
\q1 \add ≈My mind¦278612 has acquired\add* much knowledge¦278633 and wisdom.”
\q1
\v 17 I \add ≈made it¦278646 my aim to discover\add* knowledge and wisdom¦278638 \add versus\add* madness¦278640 and folly¦278641.
\q1 I was aware that that also is chasing after the wind¦278648
\q1
\v 18 because \add ≈having much wisdom¦278652 leads to much frustration¦278655\add*
\q1 ≈and¦278656 anyone who's adding knowledge¦278657 is \add also\add* adding pain.

\rem /s1 The Futility of Pleasure; Pleasures Are Meaningless; The Futility of Self-Indulgence
\p
\v 1 I said¦278661 \add ≈to myself\add*,
\q1 “Come on, let me \add ≈find out what's good¦278670 and enjoy¦278669 the pleasure¦278666 from them\add*.”
\q1 But look, it¦278674 was also pointless.
\q1
\v 2 To laughter¦278677, I said¦278678, “It's madness,”
\q1 ≈and¦278680 to joy, “What's \add ≈the point of this\add*?”
\q1
\v 3 I explored in myself how to \add ≈indulge my body¦278692\add* with wine, but my \add ≈mind\add* was guiding¦278694 me in wisdom¦278695.
\q1 \add ≈Also,\add* how to grasp foolishness
\q1 until¦278698 I could see whether that's better for humanity¦278707 to do \add ≈while they¦278709 live out their¦278714 lives¦278714 here on this earth\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 4 I expanded my \add ≈program of works¦278717\add*.
\q1 I built¦278718 houses¦278720 for myself.
\q1 I planted¦278721 vineyards¦278723 for myself.\x + \xo 2:4-8: \xt 1Ki 10:23-27; 2Ch 9:22-27.\x*
\q1
\v 5 I made gardens¦278727 for myself, and royal parks¦278728,
\q1 and I planted¦278729 \add ≈all different kinds\add* of fruit¦278734 trees in them.
\q1
\v 6 I constructed pools¦278738 for myself
\q1 to \add ≈irrigate\add* a forest¦278742 of growing trees¦278744.
\q1
\v 7 I acquired¦278746 male and female¦278748 servants,
\q1 and \add ≈the children born to them\add* belonged to me.
\q1 Also \add ≈a large number\add* of sheep and cattle belonged to me—
\q1 more than all \add ≈my predecessors\add* in Yerushalem¦278764.\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 1Ki 4:23.\x*
\q1
\v 8 I also accumulated gold¦278771 and silver¦278770 for myself,
\q1 and treasure¦278772 from kings¦278773 and from the provinces¦278774.
\q1 I appointed male and female singers¦278777 for myself,
\q1 and the pleasures of the sons of humanity¦278781—\add ≈many women\add*.\x + \xo 2:8: \xt 1Ki 10:10,14-22.\x*
\b
\q1
\v 9 \add ≈So¦278785 I became¦278785 famous\add*,
\q1 and¦278786 I added more than all who \add ≈preceded me\add* in Yerushalem¦278790.
\q1 Also my wisdom¦278792 stayed with me.\x + \xo 2:9: \xt 1Ch 29:25.\x*
\q1
\v 10 \add ≈Everything my eyes¦278799 wanted\add*, I \add ^gave\add* them.
\q1 I didn't¦278800 \add ≈hold back\add* from \add ≈anything that would make me happy\add*,
\q1 because \add ≈I was happy inside\add* from all my work
\q1 and¦278819 that was my reward¦278822 from all my effort.
\q1
\v 11 And I turned, I, to all \add ≈the things that I'd made\add*
\q1 and to the work that I'd done,
\q1 and look, everything¦278838 was pointless and chasing¦278840 after the wind¦278841,
\q1 and there wasn't any profit \add ≈in anything done in this world\add*.
\rem /s1 The Wise and the Foolish; Wisdom and Joy Given to One Who Pleases God; Wisdom and Folly Are Meaningless
\p
\v 12 Then¦278847 I¦278848 \add ≈changed direction to investigate\add* wisdom¦278850 and madness¦278851 and folly¦278852,
\q1 because what could \add ≈any future\add* king¦278859 do that¦278861 hasn't already¦278863 been done?
\q1
\v 13 I¦278867 saw¦278866 that wisdom¦278870 \add ≈is to be preferred over\add* folly¦278873,
\q1 just as light¦278875 \add ≈is to be preferred\add* over darkness¦278878.
\q1
\v 14 \add ≈The wise person uses their¦278895\add* eyes¦278881,
\q1 \add ≈but\add* the fool walks in the darkness¦278884,
\q1 and even I know that \add ≈the same fate comes\add* to both of them.
\q1
\v 15 I said \add ≈to myself\add*, “\add ≈The fool's end will also come\add* to me,
\q1 \add ≈so what use was it being\add* so wise back then?”
\q1 Then¦278897 I \add ≈told myself\add* that that also is pointless,
\q1
\v 16 because \add ≈neither the wise person nor the fool will be remembered¦278920 forever\add*,
\q1 \add ≈as they'll both be forgotten¦278930 in the days¦278927 to come\add*—
\q1 and¦278931 how \add strange it¦278930 is\add* that the wise die¦278932 \add ≈just like\add* the fool!
\q1
\rem /s1 The Futility of Work; Toil Is Meaningless
\v 17 Then¦278938 I hated¦278938 life¦278941 because of the misfortune around me—
\q1 the work that was done \add ≈in this world\add*,
\q1 because everything¦278951 was pointless and¦278953 chasing¦278953 after the wind¦278954.
\p
\v 18 Then¦278956 I hated¦278956 all the work that I'd done \add ≈in this world\add*
\q1 that will get left to those who follow me \add after¦278970 I go\add*.
\q1
\v 19 And who knows whether¦278974 \add @my successor\add* will be wise or a fool?
\q1 He'll have authority over all my \add ≈projects\add* that¦278982 I \add ≈worked hard on\add*
\q1 and which I've \add ≈applied wisdom¦278983 to in this world\add*.
\q1 That also was pointless.
\q1
\v 20 Then¦278991 I \add ≈changed\add* to despairing¦278993 over all the \add ≈projects in this world that I'd worked hard on\add*,
\q1
\v 21 because there¦279007 \add #are people\add* whose work is in wisdom¦279010 and knowledge¦279011, and in skill¦279012.
\q1 \add ≈However,\add* then a person¦279008 who hasn't worked on it, will \add ≈gain it as their inheritance\add*.
\q1 That also is pointless and a great¦279025 misfortune
\q1
\v 22 because what does a person get in exchange for all their work and¦279035 \add ≈their goals in life that¦279040 they work towards in this world\add*?
\q1
\v 23 Because all his days¦279048 are painful, and¦279050 anger is his business—
\q1 even in the night¦279054, his \add ≈mind¦279058\add* doesn't rest.
\q1 That also is pointless.\x + \xo 2:23: \xt Yob 5:7; 14:1.\x*
\q1
\v 24 There's¦279065 nothing better for humanity other than eating and drinking¦279070,
\q1 and \add ≈genuinely enjoying their hard work\add*.
\q1 Also I saw that that comes from God\x + \xo 2:24: \xt Ecc 3:13; 5:18; 9:7; Isa 56:12; Luk 12:19; 1Cor 15:32.\x*
\q1
\v 25 because who could eat¦279089 and¦279090 enjoy¦279091 \add life\add* apart from him?
\q1
\v 26 \add ≈Yes,\add* he gives wisdom¦279100 and knowledge¦279101 and happiness to \add ≈people who are good in his sight\add*.
\q1 But to the sinner¦279103, he gives the job of gathering¦279106 and collecting¦279107 to give to the one who's good \add ≈in God's sight\add*.

\v 10 I've seen¦279205 the task that¦279209 God¦279211 has given¦279210 people to \add ≈keep them occupied\add*.
\q1
\v 11 \add @God\add* makes everything¦279219 \add ≈happen at the appropriate\add* time¦279222.
\q1 Also, he puts \add the awareness of\add* eternity¦279226 into \add ≈the human mind\add*,
\q1 yet humanity can't¦279229 grasp \add ≈what\add* God has done from \add the\add* beginning¦279242 to \add the\add* end¦279245.
\q1
\v 12 I know¦279247 that there's¦279249 nothing better for them
\q1 than being cheerful and doing good during \add #their lives\add*
\q1
\v 13 and everyone should eat¦279264 and drink¦279265 and see good¦279267 in \add ≈everything they do\add*—
\q1 that's a gift¦279271 from God¦279272.
\q1
\v 14 I know¦279275 that everything God does will be enduring.
\q1 There's nothing that needs to be added¦279287 to it, or taken¦279290 away,

\q1

\v 16 Then¦279311 again I¦279312 saw \add ≈in this world\add* at the place of judgement, there was wickedness,

\q1
\v 17 I said¦279324 \add ≈to myself\add*, “God will judge¦279333 the righteous¦279329 and the wicked¦279332,

\q1
\v 19 because the \add ≈same one thing happens to both people and animals\add*:

\q1
\v 22 Then¦279424 I saw¦279424 that there¦279426 is nothing better than that \add ≈people\add* would enjoy their work,

\v 8 \add ≈Sometimes there's a person living alone without a child or a relative, who works hard without stopping\add*.
\q1 \add ≈However, wealth¦279580 doesn't satisfy¦279579 them because they wonder why they're working so hard and not sitting down to enjoy their good things\add*.

\v 9 Besides the fact that the leader was wise, he still taught¦281997 the people¦282002 knowledge¦281999, and he searched and evaluated. He \add ≈arranged¦282005 and edited\add* many proverbs¦282006.
