\rem /s1 The Futility of Wisdom; The Philosopher's Experience; The Futility of Seeking Wisdom; Wisdom Is Meaningless
\q1
\v 12 I, the leader, was king¦278551 over Yisrael in Yerushalem¦278555.
\q1
\v 13 I \add ≈used my mind and\add* wisdom¦278563 to discover and to explore¦278562 everything that is done \add ≈in this world\add*.
\q1 It's a difficult job that God¦278576 has given¦278575 humanity¦278578 to be busy with.
\q1
\v 14 I saw all the deeds that are done \add ≈in this world\add*,
\q1 and look—everything's pointless \add like\add* chasing¦278594 after the wind¦278595.
\q1
\v 15 Something that's bent can't be straightened¦278601 \add again\add*,
\q1 ≈and¦278602 what's missing can't be counted¦278606.
\q1
\v 16 I spoke¦278608 with \add ≈sincerity\add*, saying, “Look at me—I've become \add ≈powerful\add*,
\q1 and I've \add ≈increased¦278617 in wisdom relative to everyone¦278620 who ruled before me\add* \add here\add* in Yerushalem¦278628.\x + \xo 1:16: \xt 1Ki 4:29-31.\x*
\q1 \add ≈My mind¦278612 has acquired\add* much knowledge¦278633 and wisdom.”
\q1
\v 17 I \add ≈made it¦278646 my aim to discover\add* knowledge and wisdom¦278638 \add versus\add* madness¦278640 and folly¦278641.
\q1 I was aware that that also is chasing after the wind¦278648
\q1
\v 18 because \add ≈having much wisdom¦278652 leads to much frustration¦278655\add*
\q1 ≈and¦278656 anyone who's adding knowledge¦278657 is \add also\add* adding pain.

\rem /s1 The Futility of Pleasure; Pleasures Are Meaningless; The Futility of Self-Indulgence
\p
\v 1 I said¦278661 \add ≈to myself\add*,
\q1 “Come on, let me \add ≈find out what's good¦278670 and enjoy¦278669 the pleasure¦278666 from them\add*.”
\q1 But look, it¦278674 was also pointless.
\q1
\v 2 To laughter¦278677, I said¦278678, “It's madness,”
\q1 ≈and¦278680 to joy, “What's \add ≈the point of this\add*?”
\q1
\v 3 I explored in myself how to \add ≈indulge my body¦278692\add* with wine, but my \add ≈mind\add* was guiding¦278694 me in wisdom¦278695.
\q1 \add ≈Also,\add* how to grasp foolishness
\q1 until¦278698 I could see whether that's better for humanity¦278707 to do \add ≈while they¦278709 live out their¦278714 lives¦278714 here on this earth\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 4 I expanded my \add ≈program of works¦278717\add*.
\q1 I built¦278718 houses¦278720 for myself.
\q1 I planted¦278721 vineyards¦278723 for myself.\x + \xo 2:4-8: \xt 1Ki 10:23-27; 2Ch 9:22-27.\x*
\q1
\v 5 I made gardens¦278727 for myself, and royal parks¦278728,
\q1 and I planted¦278729 \add ≈all different kinds\add* of fruit¦278734 trees in them.
\q1
\v 6 I constructed pools¦278738 for myself
\q1 to \add ≈irrigate\add* a forest¦278742 of growing trees¦278744.
\q1
\v 7 I acquired¦278746 male and female¦278748 servants,
\q1 and \add ≈the children born to them\add* belonged to me.
\q1 Also \add ≈a large number\add* of sheep and cattle belonged to me—
\q1 more than all \add ≈my predecessors\add* in Yerushalem¦278764.\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 1Ki 4:23.\x*
\q1
\v 8 I also accumulated gold¦278771 and silver¦278770 for myself,
\q1 and treasure¦278772 from kings¦278773 and from the provinces¦278774.
\q1 I appointed male and female singers¦278777 for myself,
\q1 and the pleasures of the sons of humanity¦278781—\add ≈many women\add*.\x + \xo 2:8: \xt 1Ki 10:10,14-22.\x*
\b
\q1
\v 9 \add ≈So¦278785 I became¦278785 famous\add*,
\q1 and¦278786 I added more than all who \add ≈preceded me\add* in Yerushalem¦278790.
\q1 Also my wisdom¦278792 stayed with me.\x + \xo 2:9: \xt 1Ch 29:25.\x*
\q1
\v 10 \add ≈Everything my eyes¦278799 wanted\add*, I \add ^gave\add* them.
\q1 I didn't¦278800 \add ≈hold back\add* from \add ≈anything that would make me happy\add*,
\q1 because \add ≈I was happy inside\add* from all my work
\q1 and¦278819 that was my reward¦278822 from all my effort.
\q1
\v 11 And I turned, I, to all \add ≈the things that I'd made\add*
\q1 and to the work that I'd done,
\q1 and look, everything¦278838 was pointless and chasing¦278840 after the wind¦278841,
\q1 and there wasn't any profit \add ≈in anything done in this world\add*.
\rem /s1 The Wise and the Foolish; Wisdom and Joy Given to One Who Pleases God; Wisdom and Folly Are Meaningless
\p
\v 12 Then¦278847 I¦278848 \add ≈changed direction to investigate\add* wisdom¦278850 and madness¦278851 and folly¦278852,
\q1 because what could \add ≈any future\add* king¦278859 do that hasn't already¦278863 been done?
\q1
\v 13 I¦278867 saw¦278866 that wisdom¦278870 \add ≈is to be preferred over\add* folly¦278873,
\q1 just as light¦278875 \add ≈is to be preferred\add* over darkness¦278878.
\q1
\v 14 \add ≈The wise person uses their¦278895\add* eyes¦278881,
\q1 \add ≈but\add* the fool walks in the darkness¦278884,
\q1 and even I know that \add ≈the same fate comes\add* to both of them.
\q1
\v 15 I said \add ≈to myself\add*, “\add ≈The fool's end will also come\add* to me,
\q1 \add ≈so what use was it being\add* so wise back then?”
\q1 Then¦278897 I \add ≈told myself\add* that that also is pointless,
\q1
\v 16 because \add ≈neither the wise person nor the fool will be remembered¦278920 forever\add*,
\q1 \add ≈as they'll both be forgotten¦278930 in the days¦278927 to come\add*—
\q1 and¦278931 how \add strange it¦278930 is\add* that the wise die¦278932 \add ≈just like\add* the fool?
\q1
\rem /s1 The Futility of Work; Toil Is Meaningless
\v 17 Then¦278938 I hated¦278938 life¦278941 because of the misfortune around me—
\q1 the work that was done \add ≈in this world\add*,
\q1 because everything¦278951 was pointless and¦278953 chasing¦278953 after the wind¦278954.
\p
\v 18 Then¦278956 I hated¦278956 all the work that I'd done \add ≈in this world\add*
\q1 that will get left to those who follow me \add after¦278970 I go\add*.
\q1
\v 19 And who knows whether¦278974 \add @my successor\add* will be wise or a fool?
\q1 He'll have authority over all my \add ≈projects\add* that I \add ≈worked hard on\add*
\q1 and which I've \add ≈applied wisdom¦278983 to in this world\add*.
\q1 That also was pointless.
\q1
\v 20 Then¦278991 I \add ≈changed\add* to despairing¦278993 over all the \add ≈projects in this world that I'd worked hard on\add*,
\q1
\v 21 because there¦279007 \add #are people\add* whose work is in wisdom¦279010 and knowledge¦279011, and in skill¦279012.
\q1 \add ≈However,\add* then a person¦279008 who hasn't worked on it, will \add ≈gain it as their inheritance\add*.
\q1 That also is pointless and a great¦279025 misfortune
\q1
\v 22 because what does a person get in exchange for all their work and¦279035 \add ≈their goals in life that they work towards in this world\add*?
\q1
\v 23 Because all his days¦279048 are painful, and¦279050 anger is his business—
\q1 even in the night¦279054, his \add ≈mind¦279058\add* doesn't rest.
\q1 That also is pointless.\x + \xo 2:23: \xt Yob 5:7; 14:1.\x*
\q1
\v 24 There's¦279065 nothing better for humanity other than eating and drinking¦279070,

\q1 Also I saw that that comes from God\x + \xo 2:24: \xt Ecc 3:13; 5:18; 9:7; Isa 56:12; Luk 12:19; 1Cor 15:32.\x*

\q1
\v 26 \add ≈Yes,\add* he gives wisdom¦279100 and knowledge¦279101 and happiness to \add ≈people who are good in his sight\add*.
\q1 But to the sinner¦279103, he gives the job of gathering¦279106 and collecting¦279107 to give to the one who's good \add ≈in God's sight\add*.

\v 11 \add @God\add* makes everything¦279219 \add ≈happen at the appropriate\add* time¦279222.

\v 14 I know¦279275 that everything God does will be enduring.
\q1 There's nothing that needs to be added¦279287 to it, or taken¦279290 away,

\v 4 When you \add ≈promise something\add* to God,
\q1 don't¦279804 \add ≈put off doing what you promised\add*
\q1 because \add ≈no one likes\add* fools.
\q1 Whatever you promise, do it!\x + \xo 5:4: \xt Psa 66:13-14.\x*
\q1
\v 5 It's¦279835 better not to make a promise
\q1 than to promise something and then not do it.
\q1
\v 6 Don't allow your mouth to cause your \add whole\add* body to sin,
\q1 and don't tell the \add temple\add* messenger that it was an unintentional sin.
\q1 Why \add ≈make God angry by what you say\add*
\q1 and destroy the \add good\add* \add ≈things that you've done\add*?
\q1
\v 7 \add ≈Yes, there's\add* many dreams and pointless things and many words—
\q1 just \add ≈respect and strive to obey\add* God.
\s1 Not/None purpose of wealth
\rem /s1 The Futility of Wealth; Life Is Useless; Riches Are Meaningless
\p
\v 8 If you see the extortion of the poor
\q1 and the \add ≈perversion\add* of justice and righteousness in the \add #provinces\add*,
\q1 don't be amazed about it¦279889 because a high \add official\add* is watching over another \add official\add*,
\q1 and higher \add ones\add* are watching over them.
\q1
\v 9 \add ?≈Land is an advantage for everyone¦279896—the king gets served from the countryside\add*.
\q1
\v 10 A person who loves \add ≈money\add* won't be satisfied with \add *it\add*,
\q1 and¦279918 whoever loves wealth \add ≡won't be satisfied\add* with their¦279921 income.
\q1 That's also pointless.
\q1
\v 11 When \add material\add* goods increase, people's consumption increases,
\q1 and what advantage does the owner get \add ≈other than just feeding\add* his eyes?
\q1
\v 12 The¦279951 labourer has a pleasant sleep, whether they've had a lot to eat or just a little,
\q1 ^\add ≈but\add* the \add ≈many investments\add* of the rich person don't permit them to sleep.
\q1
\v 13 There's a \add ≈sad contradiction\add* that I've seen \add ≈in this world\add*:
\q1 wealth¦279961 \add ≈hoarded up\add* by its \add ≈owner, but working to destroy him\add*.
\q1
\v 14 Then that wealth \add ≈was lost in a failed investment\add*
\q1 and \add although\add* he \add ≈had\add* a son, he had nothing left¦279973 \add ≈to live on\add*.
\q1
\v 15 \add ≈He was naked when he was born and he'll be naked when he goes again\add*,
\q1 and \add ≈despite all his hard work\add*, he won't \add be able to\add* take any \add ≈money with him\add*.\x + \xo 5:15: \xt Yob 1:21; Psa 49:17; 1Tim 6:7.\x*
\q1
\v 16 This is also a sickening misfortune:
\q1 He will leave \add this world\add* just like he¦280013 entered \add it\add*,
\q1 and what profit belongs to him¦280016 who will work hard for the wind?
\q1
\v 17 What's more, all his \add ≈life¦280045\add* he'll eat¦280029 in darkness,
\q1 and in a lot of distress, as well as sickness and anger.
\q1
\v 18 Listen, this is what I myself have discovered to be good:
\q1 It's good \add for a person\add* to eat and drink
\q1 and to see benefit in all the hard work that they'll do \add ≈in this world\add*
\q1 during the number of the days of their life that God¦280083 has given¦280066 \add @that person\add*,
\q1 because that's their allocation \add in life\add*.
\q1
\v 19 Also, each person who's been given wealth and possessions by God and has been empowered
\q1 to eat from it
\q1 and to accept their allocation \add in life¦280094\add*
\q1 and to enjoy their hard work:
\q1 that's a gift from God.
\q1
\v 20 Those people don't retain a memory of each day \add that passed\add*
\q1 because God keeps them full of internal happiness.
