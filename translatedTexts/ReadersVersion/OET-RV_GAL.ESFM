\mt2 Paul's letter to the assemblies in
\mt1 Galatia
\is1 Introduction
\ip At the time when the preaching of the good message about Yeshua began to spread and it started being accepted by non-Jews, an important question arose: whether or not it's necessary for a person wanting to accept the message to also obey the Law of Mosheh. Paul argues that it's not necessary because it's by faith that we can receive life from the messiah, and it's by faith that a person is considered guiltless in God's eyes. But there among the groups of believers in Galasya (a province of Rome in Asia Minor, now part of modern Turkey), there were people who disagreed with Paul and believed that it's still necessary for a follower of Yeshua to obey all of Mosheh's laws in order to become righteous in God's sight.
\ip In \bk Paul's letter to the assemblies in Galatia\bk*, he wrote so that people who had started to follow deviant teachings might return to the true faith. He began this by explaining the reasons that he himself became a missionary. He showed that his becoming a missionary wasn't because he was selected by the people, but that God himself spoke to him, and what's more, he was specifically sent by God to the non-Jews. As a result of that, he strove to ensure that people understood that there's only one way to restore our relationship with God, and that's through faith in God's son.
\ip Nearer the end of his letter, he answered those who say that it's wrong not to obey Mosheh's law. Paul stated that he would be afraid to leave behind God's goodness and mercy just to become a slave of Mosheh's rules. Again he advised that it's necessary for them to listen to God's spirit so that they're changed and don't follow the sinful desires of their own bodies.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul¦126511, a missionary \add of Yeshua\add*, not chosen by people or any human¦126515 desire, but¦126519 chosen \add directly\add* by Yeshua the \nd messiah¦126522\nd* and¦126523 \nd God¦126524\nd* the father¦126525 who raised¦126527 Yeshua from the dead¦126531.
\v 2 \add On behalf of\add* all the believers here, \add I'm writing\add* to the assemblies¦126539 \add of believers\add* in Galatia¦126541.
\p
\v 3 May you¦126543 all experience the grace¦126542 and peace¦126545 that comes from \nd God¦126547\nd* the father¦126548 and our¦126552 \nd master¦126551 Yeshua¦126553\nd* the \nd messiah¦126554\nd*—
\v 4 the one who gave¦126556 himself¦126558 for our sins¦126562 and¦126579 to rescue¦126565 us out of this present¦126572, evil¦126573 age according¦126574 to the desire of \nd God¦126578\nd* our father¦126580
\v 5 who will be praised even through future ages. May¦126591 it¦126591 be so¦126591.
\s1 There's only one good message
\rem /s1 The One Gospel; One gospel for all; There Is Only One Good News; There Is No Other Gospel
\p
\v 6 I'm astounded that you've all so quickly¦126595 replaced the good¦126607 message¦126607 \add that you heard\add* from the one who called¦126599 you to the grace¦126603 of the \nd messiah¦126604\nd*. You've replaced it with another¦126606 narrative
\v 7 which¦126608 is not at all another¦126611 good message, but rather comes from those who are confusing you and wanting¦126620 to alter¦126621 the \add actual\add* good message about the \nd messiah¦126625\nd*.
\v 8 Even if either we ourselves or \add even\add* a messenger¦126632 out of heaven¦126634 were to preach a different ‘good message’ which disagrees with the good message that we \add first\add* preached to you, then they should¦126643 be cursed¦126642.
\v 9 As we have previously¦126645 said¦126645, and even now say it again¦126649: if anyone¦126652 preaches¦126654 a ‘good¦126654 message¦126654’ to you that's different from what you already heard, let that person be cursed¦126659.
\p
\v 10 Am I trying to please and persuade¦126664 people or \nd God¦126667\nd*? If I was still¦126674 trying to please people, I wouldn't be a \add worthy\add* slave¦126678 of the \nd messiah¦126677\nd*.

\p
\v 11 I'm letting you all know, brothers¦126686 and¦126686 sisters¦126686, that the good message I proclaimed didn't¦126695 just come from human¦126698 ideas.
\v 12 It didn't come from my ideas nor was I taught¦126708 it by some other person, but it was revealed to me by \nd Yeshua¦126712\nd* the \nd messiah¦126713\nd*.
\p
\v 13 You've all heard¦126714 about my previous behaviour when as a strict Jew, I was extreme in persecuting\x + \xo 1:13: \xt Acts 8:3; 22:4-5; 26:9-11.\x* the assembly¦126728 of God's people and¦126731 was trying to destroy them.
\v 14 I was progressing¦126735 in Judaism¦126738\x + \xo 1:14: \xt Acts 22:3.\x* quicker than many of my¦126745 contemporaries¦126741, being¦126750 so much more zealous¦126749 in observing our ancient traditions¦126754.
\p
\v 15 But \add God\add* who'd planned this from even before I was born,\x + \xo 1:15-16: \xt Acts 9:3-6; 22:6-10; 26:13-18.\x* because of his¦126774 grace¦126773 he called¦126770 me
\v 16 so that he could reveal¦126775 his¦126778 son through me and could preach¦126782 the good¦126782 message¦126782 to non-Jews¦126786. I didn't¦126788 rush to get advice from others,
\v 17 nor did I head to Yerushalem¦126798 to \add consult with\add* the ambassadors¦126803 there that preceded me, but I went away to Arabia¦126808 and then later returned¦126811 to Damascus¦126813.
\v 18 Then finally after¦126815 three¦126817 years¦126816 I went¦126819 to Yerushalem¦126822\x + \xo 1:18: \xt Acts 9:26-30.\x* to get to know Peter, and¦126826 stayed with him¦126830 for just over two weeks.
\v 19 I didn't¦126837 meet any of the other ambassadors¦126836 other than Yeshua's brother¦126844, Yacob¦126842,
\v 20 and what I'm writing to you, I'm writing with \nd God¦126854\nd* watching, so I'm not lying¦126857.
\p
\v 21 Then I went¦126859 into the regions¦126862 of Syria¦126864 and¦126865 Cilicia¦126867.
\v 22 The assemblies¦126875 back in Yudea¦126878 believing in the \nd messiah¦126881\nd* didn't¦126870 know me by sight
\v 23 but¦126883 had only heard about me—that the person who'd once been persecuting them was now preaching¦126892 the good¦126892 message¦126892 about the faith¦126894 himself,
\v 24 and they¦126899 praised¦126899 \nd God¦126903\nd* because of \add what had happened to\add* me.

\p
\v 1 It was fourteen¦126906 years¦126907 later that I made the uphill trek to Yerushalem¦126912\x + \xo 2:1: \xt Acts 11:30; 15:2.\x* with Barnabas¦126914 and taking Titos¦126918 along¦126916 as well.
\v 2 \add God\add* had told me to go there and I explained to the \add leaders there\add* the good¦126927 message¦126927 that I'd been proclaiming¦126929 to the non-Jews¦126932. I did it privately to double-check that I wasn't somehow¦126939 just acting vainly.
\v 3 But not even Titos¦126947 who was with me was compelled¦126953 to be circumcised¦126954 even though he is a Greek¦126951.
\v 4 However some false¦126959 brothers¦126959 were sneaked¦126958 in to monitor the freedoms¦126964 that we¦126967 have in the \nd messiah¦126970\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦126971\nd*, and wanting us to be enslaved¦126974 to their traditions.
\v 5 But we¦126980 didn't¦126977 even submit¦126982 to them for one hour¦126979, so that the truth¦126985 of the good¦126988 message¦126988 could continue¦126989 amongst you¦126992.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6: \xt Deu 10:17.\x*And those people who were supposed \add leaders\add* (although what they were didn't mean much to me because¦127012 \nd God¦127007\nd* doesn't go by appearances¦127005) didn't really contribute¦127016 anything useful as far as I could tell.
\v 7 Instead, they saw that I've been entrusted with taking the good¦127024 message¦127024 to the non-Jews just like Peter¦127028 was entrusted to take it to the Jews
\v 8 because the same \add God\add* who worked in Peter¦127034 to commission him to the Jews also worked in me \add to commission me\add* towards¦127043 the non-Jews¦127045.
\v 9 So seeing the grace¦127049 that \add God\add* had shown towards me, Yacob¦127053 and Peter and Yohan¦127058, the apparent pillars¦127061 \add of the assemblies\add* accepted me and Barnabas¦127067 as equals, so that we¦127070 could go¦127070 to the non-Jews¦127074 and them to the Jews.
\v 10 Also \add they said that\add* we¦127084 need to keep helping the poor, but I was eager to do that anyway.

\p
\v 11 But when Peter came¦127093 to Antioch¦127097, I had to oppose him¦127100 to his face¦127099, because¦127102 he¦127104 had messed up.
\v 12 He'd been eating with non-Jews¦127115, but when Yacob¦127112 and companions arrived, he about-faced and started eating separately because¦127107 he was afraid of \add being criticised by\add* the strict Jews.
\v 13 The other Jews¦127136 with him¦127132 were also being hypocrites, so much so that even Barnabas¦127140 joined their¦127143 hypocrisy,
\v 14 but¦127146 when I saw¦127148 that they weren't being¦127166 honest with the truth¦127154 of the good¦127156 message¦127156, I had to say to Peter in front of everybody, “If you Jews are living¦127173 more like non-Jews and not like \add strict\add* Jews, how can you force non-Jews to obey all the Jewish traditions?”
\s1 You can't be saved by obeying rules
\rem /s1 Jews and Gentiles Are Saved by Faith
\p
\v 15 We follow Jewish laws and¦127184 not the customs of other nations,
\v 16 but we know that we're not saved by following rules\x + \xo 2:16: a \xt Psa 143:2; Rom 3:20; \xo b \xt Rom 3:22.\x* but only by faith in Yeshua the messiah. So we've believed¦127211 in Yeshua the messiah so that we can be made guiltless by our faith in the messiah, and not by obeying all those rules, because¦127222 all of those rules can never make any person¦127194 guiltless.
\v 17 However if we attempt to be made guiltless through the messiah yet find that we're sinners¦127243, does that mean that the messiah is servant¦127247 to sin¦127246? That could never be so!
\v 18 If I rebuild what I've already torn down, that would show me to be a law-breaker.
\v 19 \x + \xo 2:19: \xt Rom 6:1-11; 7:1-6.\x*It was the law that showed me that I needed die to the idea of following the law so that I could live¦127269 \add to serve\add* \nd God¦127268\nd* \add instead\add*. I was executed on a post along with the \nd messiah¦127270\nd*
\v 20 and I'm not living any more, but it's the \nd messiah¦127280\nd* now living in me. The way that my body¦127286 stays alive now is by living by faith¦127288 in God's son—the one who loved¦127298 me and allowed himself¦127302 to be executed for me.
\v 21 I'm not rejecting¦127306 God's grace¦127308, because¦127312 if the law could make me guiltless, that would mean that the \nd messiah¦127317\nd* died¦127319 unnecessarily.

\p
\v 1 You foolish¦127321 Galatians¦127322, who tricked you¦127324 into changing? You know that \nd Yeshua¦127333\nd* the \nd messiah¦127334\nd* was publicly¦127335 known to have been executed¦127338 \add by being nailed to\add*\x + \xo 3:1: \xt Jhn 20:25.\x* a post¦127338.
\v 2 So I just want to ask you one thing: did you receive¦127351 the \nd spirit¦127350\nd* from obeying all the rules, or was it by faith¦127355 when you heard?
\v 3 So aren't you being foolish¦127357? Having¦127359 begun¦127359 in the \nd spirit¦127360\nd*, now you're all focussing back on bodily discipline.
\v 4 You vainly endured so many things—it was vain wasn't it?
\v 5 So¦127373 the one who gave the \nd spirit¦127377\nd* to you and worked miracles¦127380 among¦127381 you all, did all that come about from obeying the rules or by the faith¦127392 that came from hearing¦127391 \add the good message\add*?
\s1 The spreading of Abraham's blessing
\p
\v 6 Abraham¦127394\x + \xo 3:6: \xt Gen 15:6; Rom 4:3.\x* believed¦127395 in \nd God¦127397\nd* and¦127398 was declared guiltless as a result.
\v 7 So now anyone who exercises faith¦127409 is a descendant of Abraham¦127414.\x + \xo 3:7: \xt Rom 4:16.\x*
\v 8 \x + \xo 3:8: \xt Gen 12:3.\x*The \add writers of the\add* scriptures¦127418 foresaw¦127415 that \nd God¦127427\nd* was going to make non-Jews¦127424 guiltless through faith¦127421 when he promised to Abraham¦127430 that all the nations¦127437 would be blessed¦127432 through him,
\v 9 so those who have faith¦127441 \add that Yeshua is the messiah\add* will be blessed just as Abraham¦127446 was blessed for believing¦127445 \add God\add*.
\p
\v 10 All those who strive to be saved by obeying the law are under¦127453 a curse, because¦127457 it's written that ‘everyone is cursed who doesn't live by and fulfil everything that's been written down in the scroll¦127473 of the law’.\x + \xo 3:10: \xt Deu 27:26 (LXX).\x*
\v 11 It's clear that no one can be made guiltless before¦127485 \nd God¦127487\nd* because¦127489 \add it's written that\add* ‘those who are guiltless will live by faith¦127493’.\x + \xo 3:11: \xt Hab 2:4.\x*
\v 12 And the law doesn't produce faith¦127501, but¦127502 ‘the person who obeys these things is the one who will live’.\x + \xo 3:12: \xt Lev 18:5.\x*
\p
\v 13 The \nd messiah¦127511\nd* saved us from the curse of the law by becoming¦127519 the curse for our sake, because¦127523 it's written¦127524, ‘\nd anyone¦127511\nd* who is hung on a tree¦127531 is cursed’.\x + \xo 3:13: \xt Deu 21:23.\x*
\v 14 He \add paid the price for us\add* so that the blessing¦127537 for Abraham¦127539 would also reach the non-Jews¦127535 through the \nd messiah¦127542 Yeshua¦127543\nd* and we¦127552 \add all\add* would be able to receive¦127552 the \nd spirit¦127551\nd* through faith¦127555.

\p
\v 15 Brothers¦127556 and¦127556 sisters¦127556, consider our human ways: once an agreement has been accepted, one party can't just reject¦127567 it now or add conditions¦127569.
\v 16 The promises¦127575 were given to Abraham¦127572 and¦127576 to his¦127579 offspring. It doesn't say ‘offsprings (plural)’ but¦127588 only is only referring to the one which¦127596 is the \nd messiah¦127598\nd*.
\v 17 So¦127600 what I'm telling you is that the agreement \add with Abraham\add* that was previously¦127603 ratified¦127603 by \nd God¦127606\nd*, was not annulled¦127619 430 years¦127615 later\x + \xo 3:17: \xt Exo 12:40.\x* when the law was given \add to Mosheh\add* and¦127613 nor was the promised¦127624 nullified¦127622.
\v 18 \x + \xo 3:18: \xt Rom 4:14.\x*Because¦127626 if the inheritance¦127631 now came by obeying the law, then it could no longer¦127632 be the result of the promise, but \nd God¦127642\nd* had already granted¦127640 to Abraham¦127637 via the promise.
\rem /s1 The Purpose of the Law
\v 19 So¦127644 what was the law for then? Because of sinfulness, it was added¦127651 until¦127652 the promised¦127659 descendant would come¦127655. It was directed¦127660 through¦127661 messengers¦127662 and entrusted to \add Mosheh as\add* a mediator¦127666.
\v 20 You don't¦127671 need a mediator¦127669 if there's only one party¦127670 involved, and \nd God¦127675\nd* is one.
\s1 Coming of age for the inheritance
\rem /s1 The Purpose of the Law
\p
\v 21 So¦127679 does the law oppose God's promises¦127683? Certainly not, because¦127689 if the law was able to give¦127695 life¦127695, you could become¦127687 guiltless by obeying the law.
\v 22 The scriptures¦127711 \add explain that\add* \nd everyone¦127722\nd* is imprisoned¦127709 by sin¦127715 so that by faith¦127720 in \nd Yeshua¦127721\nd* the \nd messiah¦127722\nd*, the promise¦127718 could be granted to those who believe¦127725.
\p
\v 23 Before faith could come, we were guarded¦127734 under¦127732 the law—imprisoned¦127736 so that faith could be revealed¦127741.
\rem /s1 God's Children through Faith
\v 24 So the law was our¦127746 tutor¦127745 until the \nd messiah¦127750\nd* came so that we¦127754 could then be made guiltless by faith¦127753,
\v 25 and now that we've come¦127755 to faith¦127758, we're no longer¦127759 under¦127760 our tutor¦127761.
\rem /s1 Sons of God
\p
\v 26 So you're all children of \nd God¦127767\nd* through¦127769 faith¦127771 in the \nd messiah¦127773\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦127775\nd*,
\v 27 because¦127777 \nd everyone¦127779\nd* who's been immersed¦127780 \add to obey\add* the messiah, is now cloaked in the messiah.
\v 28 Then there's no Jew¦127787 or Greek¦127789, no slave¦127793 or free person, no male or female¦127801, because¦127804 you're all \add identified\add* as being in the \nd messiah¦127809\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦127811\nd*.
\v 29 \x + \xo 3:29: \xt Rom 4:13.\x*And if you're in the \nd messiah¦127815\nd*, then now you're Abraham's descendant and so you're heirs¦127825 of that promise¦127824.

\v 1 But¦127827 as long¦127829 as the heir is underage, he's no wealthier than a slave¦127837 (even though he'll \add become\add* the master¦127838)
\v 2 but he is under¦127842 guardians¦127843 and managers¦127846 until¦127847 he reaches the age that his father¦127852 specified.
\v 3 So it is with us—when we were infants¦127858 we were enslaved¦127866 by the principles¦127861 of this world¦127863,
\v 4 but¦127868 at the appointed time¦127873, \nd God¦127876\nd* sent¦127874 his¦127879 son down to be born from a woman¦127882 and to live under¦127884 \add Mosheh's\add* law
\v 5 \x + \xo 4:5-7: \xt Rom 8:15-17.\x*so that he could buy back those enslaved under¦127888 the law and they could now be adopted¦127893 as children \add with their inheritance\add*.
\p
\v 6 So¦127896 because¦127895 you are now children, \nd God¦127901\nd* sent his¦127906 son's \nd spirit¦127903\nd* down into our¦127910 hearts¦127909 as we call out, ‘Father, father.’
\v 7 Now you¦127918 are no longer¦127917 slaves¦127919 but¦127920 children \add with full rights\add*, and¦127923 as children, heirs of God's \add promise\add*.

\v 12 I implore you all to become¦127987 like me, brothers¦127994 and¦127994 sisters¦127994, because¦127990 I'm also just like you. You haven't wronged¦127999 me in any way
\v 13 but you know that it was a result of my fleshly¦128006 weakness that I originally preached¦128007 the good¦128007 message¦128007 to you.\f + \fr 4:13 \ft Scholars are unclear whether this might mean something like ill health, poor eyesight (see v15), or even a moral weakness, so we've left it as ambiguous in the translation as it is in the original.\f*
\v 14 Yet you didn't¦128021 mock or despise me for this trial¦128013 of my¦128020 flesh¦128019, but rather all of you received me as God's messenger¦128027 like you might have received the \nd messiah¦128032 Yeshua¦128033\nd* himself.
\v 15 So¦128036 where¦128035 are your generous attitudes now? I know that back then, you would have almost dug your own eyes¦128048 out to give them to me.
\v 16 Have I now become¦128058 your¦128057 enemy¦128056 just because I told you all the truth¦128059?
\p
\v 17 Those \add others\add* have worked hard to \add try to win\add* you \add over\add* but not for good \add reasons\add*—they want to cut you off so that you'll be enthusiastic about them.
\v 18 It's good to be enthusiastic about things that are always¦128079 good, and not only at the times when I'm with you all.
\v 19 My¦128091 dear ones who I'm again¦128093 labouring¦128094 with in childbirth until¦128095 the \nd messiah¦128099\nd* becomes part of you¦128101,
\v 20 I wanted to be there with you all now and to speak quite differently than this because¦128113 I'm puzzled about you.

\v 21 Are you all who are under¦128120 the law, telling¦128117 me that you're not even hearing¦128128 what the law is?
\v 22 It's written¦128129 \add in the scriptures\add*\x + \xo 4:22: a \xt Gen 16:15; \xo b \xt Gen 21:2.\x* that Abraham¦128132 had two¦128133 sons¦128134: one son of the slave girl¦128139 \add Hagar\add*, and¦128140 one from the free woman¦128144.
\v 23 The son of the slave girl¦128150 was born from human actions, but¦128145 in contrast, the son of the free woman¦128160 was a result of God's promise¦128163.
\v 24 So if we use this as an illustration, there are two¦128171 agreements: one from Mt¦128176. Sinai¦128177 which¦128181 relates to Hagar¦128183 and give birth to enslaved people.
\v 25 Hagar's¦128187 Mt¦128189. Sinai¦128188 is in Arabia¦128194 and corresponds¦128195 to the present¦128198 \add earthly\add* Yerushalem¦128199 in slavery along with her¦128206 children¦128205.
\v 26 However the heavenly Yerushalem¦128210 which¦128207 is our¦128217 mother¦128215 is free
\v 27 because it's been written¦128218 \add in the scriptures\add*:\x + \xo 4:27: \xt Isa 54:1.\x*
\q1 ‘Be glad barren¦128221 woman,
\q2 you who have never born a child.
\q1 Be bold and shout¦128227,
\q2 you who have never been in labour¦128230,
\q1 because the lonely woman \add now\add* has many children¦128234,
\q2 even more than the woman with a husband¦128242.’
\p
\v 28 And all of you¦128243, brothers¦128246 and¦128246 sisters¦128246, are children¦128250 of the promise¦128249 like Isaac¦128248,
\v 29 but¦128253 back then the one born from human actions persecuted¦128260\x + \xo 4:29: \xt Gen 21:9.\x* the one born from the \nd spirit¦128263\nd*, and so too it continues now.
\v 30 But what do the scriptures¦128271 say? ‘Send away the slave girl and her¦128279 son because¦128281 the son of the slave girl won't¦128282 be getting the inheritance¦128283 alongside the son of the free woman¦128293.’\x + \xo 4:30: \xt Gen 21:10.\x*
\v 31 So¦128296, brothers¦128298 and¦128298 sisters¦128298, we're not \add descendants\add* of the slave girl¦128301, but¦128303 of the free woman¦128305.

\v 2 What's more, I Paul¦128324 would add that even if you all got circumcised¦128329, then the \nd messiah¦128330\nd* wouldn't be of any benefit¦128333.
\v 3 I'll say it again¦128336 clearly, every¦128337 man¦128338 who's circumcised¦128339 has put themselves in debt to obeying all of the law.
\v 4 You were released¦128347 from the \nd messiah¦128350\nd* when you moved to trusting in the law in order to be right with God—you fell away from grace¦128356 at that point.
\v 5 Because¦128359 we who are in the \nd spirit¦128360\nd* are eagerly¦128366 waiting¦128366 for the righteousness¦128364 that we are expecting to receive by faith¦128362.
\v 6 Because¦128368 in the \nd messiah¦128369 Yeshua¦128370\nd*, it's not circumcision¦128372 that achieves anything¦128373, nor uncircumcision¦128376, but¦128377 faith¦128378 worked out through¦128379 love¦128380.
\p
\v 7 You were all running¦128383 the race so well—who held you¦128386 back from believing the truth¦128390?
\v 8 It wasn't the one who called you¦128401 all.
\v 9 \x + \xo 5:9: \xt 1Cor 5:6.\x*A little¦128402 bit of yeast can make a whole¦128404 loaf of bread rise.
\v 10 I am trusting¦128410 in \nd Yahweh¦128414\nd* that you won't¦128416 be thinking¦128418 anything different \add from the truth\add*. The one who will bear the judgement is the one who has been confusing you, anyone¦128416 who that was.
\p
\v 11 But, brothers¦128432 and¦128432 sisters¦128432, if I was still preaching the Jewish rules, why would I still be being¦128440 persecuted¦128440? If I was still preaching that, then mentioning about dying on a post¦128446 wouldn't even be offensive¦128444.
\v 12 I wish that the ones upsetting¦128455 you¦128456 all \add by suggesting cutting¦128452 off bits\add*, would cut it all off.

\v 13 Brothers¦128462 and sisters, you were called¦128461 into freedom. That doesn't mean that you should use the freedom to do whatever your minds desire, but rather to be serving¦128475 each other in love¦128474.
\v 14 \x + \xo 5:14: \xt Lev 19:18.\x*Because¦128478 the entire law can be fulfilled¦128484 by obeying one rule: Love your¦128492 neighbour¦128491 like yourself¦128494.
\v 15 But if you're all snapping at and¦128500 bullying each other, watch¦128502 out or else you'll destroy each other's \add faith\add*.

\v 16 I'll tell you: allow yourselves to be led by the \nd spirit¦128509\nd* and¦128512 then your earthly desires¦128513 won't¦128516 triumph.
\v 17 \x + \xo 5:17: \xt Rom 7:15-23.\x*Because¦128519 our earthly desires oppose the spirit, and the spirit opposes our earthly desires—they oppose each other so that's why you end up doing¦128545 things that you didn't¦128539 really want to do.
\v 18 But if you are being¦128549 led by the \nd spirit¦128548\nd* then you're not \add trying to earn your way to God by\add* obeying all of Mosheh's rules.
\p
\v 19 The actions that come from our earthly desires include: sexual¦128566 immorality¦128566, impurity¦128567, sensuality,

\v 21 envy, drunkenness¦128581, carousing¦128582, and other similar¦128586 things which¦128588 I've mentioned previously. And as I \add also\add* said previously, the people that do these¦128587 things won't¦128602 be inheriting¦128603 God's kingdom¦128600.

\v 24 And for the \add followers\add* of the \nd messiah¦128630 Yeshua¦128631\nd*, earthly desires¦128640 need to be executed¦128634 on a post¦128634 along with their passions¦128637 and¦128638 lusts.
\v 25 If we're \add being led\add* by \add God's\add* spirit in our living¦128642, then we should also be aligning¦128646 \add our values\add* by the spirit.

\s1 Helping each other
\rem /s1 Bear One Another's Burdens; Doing Good to All; We Reap What We Sow
\p
\v 1 Brothers¦128655 and¦128655 sisters¦128655, if a person has been caught¦128658 sinning, all of you spiritual people need to guide the person with a spirit of gentleness¦128671, at the same time looking¦128673 at your own behaviour in case you yourselves¦128674 are also tempted¦128678.
\v 2 Help those who are going through difficulties or pain, and¦128683 in doing so you'll fulfil¦128687 the law of the \nd messiah¦128691\nd*,
\v 3 because¦128694 anyone¦128696 who supposes¦128695 themselves to be someone special but isn't, is only deceiving¦128702 themself.
\v 4 Evaluate your own actions, but¦128705 keep your boasts¦128717 to yourself and not to tell others,
\v 5 because¦128725 each person must face up to their own issues.
\p
\v 6 Those who are being¦128733 taught should¦128730 share all their blessings with those who are instructing¦128733.
\p
\v 7 Don't be fooled—you can't¦128741 \add get away with\add* mocking \nd God¦128743\nd*, because¦128748 what you sow determines what you'll harvest.
\v 8 Anyone who sows \add seed\add* to feed their earthly desires will harvest earthly corruption¦128768, but who sews spiritual \add seeds\add*, will harvest eternal¦128780 life¦128779 from the spirit.
\v 9 Don't be discouraged from doing¦128784 good \add things\add* because¦128789 we'll have a \add good\add* harvest in due course if we don't¦128785 give up.
\v 10 So¦128796 then as time¦128798 allows it, we should be working¦128801 towards good¦128804 for everybody and especially for fellow believers.
