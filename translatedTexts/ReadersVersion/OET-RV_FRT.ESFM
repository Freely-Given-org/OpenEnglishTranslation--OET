\periph Preface
\mt1 Preliminary preface
\p It is our prayer that the \em Open English Translation\em* of the Bible will give you a clear understanding of the accounts and messages written by the god-inspired Biblical writers.
\b
\m Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text of the Open English Translation of the Bible. Please double-check the text in advance before using in public. Some things (like capitalisation of ‘him’ referring to Yeshua, or of ‘father’ referring to God) in the \em OET-RV\em* haven't been decided yet so we're still testing both ways.
\is1 Introduction
\p The \em OET Literal Version\em* (OET-LV) is a technical document that presents the Hebrew and Greek texts to the English reader in words of their own language. It's not especially nice to read, but every original language word is represented in the text so you can focus on the exact words that were written (and the exact numbers and units that were used if you're tracing Biblical symbolism, etc.). It's like holding an English magnifying glass over the original documents, and sometimes these technical details are important.
\p In contrast, this \em OET Readers' Version\em* (OET-RV) is designed to help you see the big picture. Remember that one of Jesus/Yeshua's strengths was using stories and word-pictures to help his listeners understand spiritual truths. Remember that as we look back to the real-life stories of Biblical characters like Abraham and Isaac, Mosheh and the exodus from Egypt, Jonah/Yonah and many others, we can see that those narratives were also prophetic and taught about the coming messiah. So when you read this \em Readers' Version\em*, we want you to be able put aside the magnifying glass and stand back and focus on the stories and the big picture, and then on what effect they should have on your chosen lifestyle. We want those stories and their deeper meanings to stick in your mind so that you'll be excited to share the \em Good Message\em* with others via gripping stories that they can relate to.
\is1 Goals and intended audience
\m The \em OET\em* has the following goals:
\li1 The primary goal of the \em Open English Translation\em* is \bd to make the Bible more accessible to this current generation\bd* with the best of a free-and-open, easy-to-understand \em Readers' Version\em* alongside a faithful \em Literal Version\em* so that readers themselves can checkout what was said and what is interpreted by the translators.
\li1 Part of the motivation comes from our work on the street and door-to-door where we worked hard to explain the Good Message about Yeshua to people without any church background. The \em Readers' Version\em* strives to replace jargon and terminology that's only heard at church with words and phrases that should be understood by modern English speakers.
\li1 A further goal is to expose more people to some of the background of where our Bibles come from and how translators make decisions, i.e., \bd to teach\bd* a little more about original manuscripts and to challenge a little more about English translation traditions (some going back to the 1500's) that can possibly be improved.
\li1 Finally, we also want a translation that can be read by Christians with many years of Bible reading experience, but who might benefit by reading the accounts in slightly different words that make it fresh and interesting, and hopefully it will provoke deeper thought into what the original speakers or writers likely meant.
\is1 Distinctives
\m The \em OET\em* has the following distinguishing points:
\li1 An easy-to-understand \em Readers' Version\em* alongside a very \em Literal Version\em*.
\li1 A generous open license so that the \em Open English Translation\em* can be freely used in any Bible app or website, or printed in your church Bible-study notes without any verse limits and without even needing to request permission.
\li1 This \em Readers' Version\em* speaks like people around you. Because the history and legacy of English Bibles now goes back for hundreds of years, many things have been carried over that readers don't even realise. For example, we all smile at Yoda saying, “Strong is the force.” That's because naturally we would say, “The force is strong.” So think about “Great is your faithfulness.” We don't normally talk like that in natural English. (At least Miles Coverdale improved it in his version in 1535 if you look carefully.) But our aim isn't at all to criticise those who came before (because we very-much build on their shoulders)—we just want our readers to be able to share the Good Message of Yeshua the messiah with others, without them thinking that Christians speak like dinosaurs (or Yoda)!
\li1 The \em Readers' Version\em* has section headings and cross-references and most of the other features that help modern Bible readers.
\li1 The \em Readers' Version\em* uses modern units for all measurements (easy to understand and visualise), whereas the \em Literal Version\em* retains the ancient units (useful for historical and symbolic studies).
\li1 The \em Readers' Version\em* uses well-known figures of speech, or if the original figure of speech is not readily understandable, explains the point that the author appears to be trying to express. On the other hand, the \em Literal Version\em* retains the original figurative language (even if it's not a figure of speech that most modern readers are familiar with).
\li1 \it Up\it* and \it down\it* in the original languages (and thus in the \em Literal Version\em*) refer to \it uphill\it* and \it downhill\it* (which you might expect in cultures where most people walked or rode animals). However, in the \em Readers' Version\em*, \it up\it* and \it down\it* are used to refer to \it north\it* and \it south\it* respectively as per our modern norm (with computerised maps).
\li1 The \em Readers' Version\em* is less formal than most modern English Bible translations, for example, we would use contracted words like \it we'll\it* and \it didn't\it*, especially when it's in direct speech. (Always remember that the Bible was written in the languages of the common people.)
\li1 The \em Readers' Version\em* uses section headings which are very helpful to skim through when trying to locate a certain passage. However, you'll quickly notice that they are formatted in such a way as not to break the flow of the narrative or letter. This is to visually help the reader to appreciate the full context of the part they're reading, and avoid breaking the connections with what came before and what follows.
\li2 We've also tried to focus our section headings on principles that are being taught, rather than just focusing on the events happening at the time.
\li2 We also provide a list of these section headings that you can quickly skim through (including extra, alternative headings to help with searches for familiar words like ‘leper’ and ‘scribe’ which we don't use in the \em OET-RV\em*).
\li1 Being a 21\sup st\sup* century translation done in an era when there is much more effort in general to respect speakers of other languages (including the languages of ethnic minorities in our own countries) and to pronounce their names and placenames correctly, the \em OET\em* attempts to do the same for Biblical names and placenames. (All this is a little complex when we have both Hebrew and Greek versions of names and placenames—more below.) Certainly by showing a little more respect for Hebrew names, we hope to make this Bible translation a little more ‘Jew-friendly’. If you have difficulty following the names in the \em Literal Version\em*, you can always look across to the \em Readers' Version\em*. (Most English readers looking at names in the Bible all the way from \it Jericho\it* to \it John\it* would have no idea that there's no \bd J\bd* letter or sound in either Hebrew or Greek, plus there's absolutely no such name as \it James\it* in the New Testament manuscripts—it's a historical accident carried through from the Latin from an inconsistency by John Wycliffe—see https://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/biblical-topics/bible-versions-and-translations/james-or-Jacob-in-the-bible/ for example.)
\li1 In addition to wanting to get names and placenames more accurate, we've also attempted to modernise and simplify the spelling (transliterations) of these names to make it easier for readers to pronounce them as they come across them, e.g., using \bd f\bd* instead of \bd ph\bd*, so \it Epafras\it* instead of \it Epaphras\it*. (Oddly, even traditional English Bible translations surprisingly do use \it Felix\it* and \it Festus\it*.)
\li1 With regular words, we've tried to do the opposite, i.e., to use less Greek rather than more wherever possible. So a word like \it baptise\it* (which is an adapted transliteration of the Greek verb), actually gets translated, so this example becomes \it immerse\it*.
\li1 \it Italics\it* are only used for \em emphasis\em*, not to indicate \it added words\it* as historically done in older translations due to limitations of the original printing processes. The \em OET\em* fixes the problem where most modern typesetting uses \it italics\it* for \em emphasis\em* whereas older Bibles use \it italics\it* for the words which should actually be \bd deemphasised\bd*, i.e., the words which actually \bd aren't\bd* in the original manuscripts! (We use \add a lighter colour\add* for added words.)
\li1 \bd Bolding\bd* is used for \em nomina sacra\em*. This is a feature of the early Koine Greek manuscripts that isn't marked in most Bible translations (or even in most Greek New Testaments). \em Nomina Sacra\em* (which is Latin for ‘Sacred Names’) appears to be a scribal marking that usually indicate words that the scribes considered to refer to God.
\li1 The English \it Christ\it* is an adapted transliteration of the Koine Greek word \it Kristos\it* used for the original Hebrew \it messiah\it*. (It's not Jesus'/Yeshua's surname!) It seems to make sense to only use one word consistently rather than using two words for the same thing (just because they came from two different languages), so the \em OET\em* has elected to only use \it messiah\it*. However, these words actually have a meaning, just as \it President\it* is not just a title, but someone who \it presides\it* over governmental meetings. So going a step further, we have chosen to use the contemporary \bd meaning\bd* of the word in the \em Literal Version\em*. The original meaning is \it one who is anointed\it* (by pouring a hornful of oil over them), but we use the extended meaning which is \it one who is selected/chosen (by God)\it*.
\li1 Most readers living in modern democracies have never been familiar with the concept of an ancient king or \it lord\it* who has the power of life and death over them. Thus the title \it Lord Jesus/Yeshua\it* is easily said, yet relatively few actually live with Yeshua as the lord of their thoughts and actions and daily activities. (Just think how many would embarrassingly rush to turn off the video they're streaming if Yeshua appeared in the room.) As a reaction to the word \it Lord\it* seemingly becoming so cliché for many Christians, we use the translation \it master\it* as a way to get readers to at least think a little more about what the concept might mean. (The word \it boss\it* felt a little too informal.)
\li1 The \em Literal Version\em* tries to add as little as possible that's not actually there in the original manuscripts. Of course, we add spaces between words so we can read it faster, and we add capitals at the start of sentences as per standard, modern English, but we don't capitalise words like \it Kingdom of Heaven\it* or even \it He\it* when it refers to Jesus/Yeshua, because the concept of capital and small letters didn't even exist when original manuscripts like the portion visible at https://GreekCNTR.org/manuscripts/images/1G20001/1G20001-262r.jpg were written. (Our policy has more to do with accuracy and education than it does with ‘lack of respect’ or any such thing. Often this goes against religious tradition of the last few centuries, but just because something is traditional, does not necessarily mean that it is correct or even helpful.)
\li1 Most dialects of modern English don't distinguish between \it you (singular)\it* referring to just one person, and \it you (plural)\it* referring to a group of people. However, the original languages clearly distinguish these, so in order to indicate this to our readers the \em Literal Version\em* uses \it you\em _\em*all\it* for the plural form (although we are aware that some modern dialects now prefer \it y'all\it* or \it yous\it*).
\li1 Because the \em Literal Version\em* so closely follows the original languages, it's important to remember that words often don't match one-to-one between languages. This is one reason why the \em OET-LV\em* reads strangely: because we try to avoid using different English words if we can; knowing that the \em OET-LV\em* will not be natural English. Again, this is because we want the \em OET-LV\em* to be a window into what's actually written in the original languages. For fluent English (like in the \em Readers' Version\em*) the same Greek word might require several different translations when used in different contexts. For example, the Greek word translated \it raise\it* in the \em OET-LV\em* would likely require the following changes:
\li2 to \it raise\it* from sitting, we'd want: \it stand up\it*
\li2 to \it raise\it* from bed, we'd want: \it get up\it*
\li2 to \it raise\it* from the grave, we'd want: \it come back to life\it*
\li2 to \it raise\it* an object, we'd want: \it lift up\it*
\li2 to \it raise\it* a person, we'd often want: \it exalt\it* or \it praise\it*
\li2 Alert readers might be aware that there's a play on words here in the gospels. When Yeshua talked about himself \it being raised up\it*, it was deliberately ambiguous because his hearers didn't understand until right near the end that he was going to be executed. So we, looking back in history, know that he was talking about coming back to life, but at the time, they were just very confused and didn't understand what he meant. But amazingly, as well as referring to his resurrection, \it raising\it* also refers to his crucifixion as the victims on the stakes were also \it raised up\it* from the ground. (See John/Yohan 3:14.) Sadly, it's not usually possible to make a translation easy to read and understand in our current times, without losing some of the underlying meaning or ambiguities or word-plays that were presented to the original hearers. That's exactly why it's good to have \em two\em* different translations right there side-by-side in front of you!
\li1 These particular pages use British spelling, but American spelling will also be available in the future.
\li1 Our preference in most editions is to place \em The Gospel according to John/Yohan\em* \bd before\bd* \em Matthew\em*. This has a couple of advantages:
\li2 The Old Testament starts with “In the beginning, Elohim created…” and the New Testament starts with “In the beginning was the Messenger…”.
\li2 \em Acts\em* ends up right after the first book by its author \em Luke\em*.
\li2 It just reminds readers that the order of the ‘books’ in the Bible is not set by sacred degree—only by tradition.
\li2 Some do complain that the traditional order of the first four gospel accounts represent the lion, the calf, the man, and the eagle of Rev 4:6-7 which allegedly match with the banners (not described in the Bible) of the four divisions of the tribes of Israel mentioned in Numbers 2.
\li1 Beware of some traps interpreting the \em Literal Version\em*. Because it's not designed to be used alone (but rather alongside the \em Readers' Version\em*), it's \bd much more literal\bd* than most other ‘literal versions’. You'll quickly notice lighter colours that mark the deemphasis of words that had to be added to make the English sentences even make sense. But there's at least two other things that aren't necessarily changed in the English \em Literal Version\em*:
\li2 Other languages use the negative differently, especially when it's doubled or tripled in the sentence. If you don't understand this, you could easily think that the original means the opposite of what the words actually appear to say. For example the double negative: “You are\em _\em* not \em _\em*caring\em _\em*about no one.” (adapted from Matthew 22:16). In natural, fluent English, we would have to reverse the second negative to get the expected meaning, ending up with \it anyone\it* as you'll find in the \em Readers' Version\em*. But in Greek, the second negative adds emphasis rather than reversing the first negative. So our \em Literal Version\em* shows you the words that are actually there (in the Greek in this case).
\li2 Other languages may omit (or \it elide\it*) words which are clearly implied to the original reader, but which the modern English reader finds strange, e.g., a son may be divided against his father, and a daughter her mother. The elided words are ‘may be divided against’ which should follow ‘daughter’.
\m Always check the \em Readers' Version\em* carefully for how it is translated into modern, idiomatic English before jumping to any conclusions of your own about what the original language or the \em Literal Version\em* says or doesn't say.
