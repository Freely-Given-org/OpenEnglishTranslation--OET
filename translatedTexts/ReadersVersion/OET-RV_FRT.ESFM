\periph Preface
\mt1 Preface
\p It is our prayer that the
\em Open English Translation\em* of the Bible will give you a clear understanding of
the accounts and messages written by the God-inspired Biblical writers.
\b
\m Note: This is still a very early look into the unfinished text
of the \em Open English Translation\em* of the Bible.
Please double-check the text in advance before using in public.
Some things (like capitalisation of ‘him’ referring to Jesus or ‘father’ referring to God)
in the \em RV\em* haven't been decided yet so we're still testing both ways.

\is1 Goals and intended audience
\m The OET has the following goals:
\b
\li The primary goal of the \em Open English Translation\em*
is \bd to make the Bible more accessible to this current generation\bd*
with the best of a free-and-open easy-to-understand \em Readers' Version\em*
alongside a faithful \em Literal Version\em* so that readers themselves can checkout what was said and what is interpreted.
\li Part of the motivation comes from our work on the street and door-to-door
where we worked hard to explain the Good News about Jesus
to people without any church background.
The \em Readers' Version\em* strives to replace jargon and terminology that's only
heard at church with words and phrases that should be understood by modern English speakers.
\li A further goal is to expose more people to some of the background of where our Bibles come from
and how translators make decisions,
i.e., \bd to teach\bd* a little more about original manuscripts
and to challenge a little more about English translation traditions
(some going back to the 1500's)
that can possibly be improved.
\li Finally, we also want a translation that can be read by Christians with
many years of Bible reading experience,
but who might benefit by reading the accounts in slightly different words
that make it fresh and interesting, and
even provokes deeper thought into what the original speakers or writers
likely meant.

\is1 Distinctives
\m The OET has the following distinguishing points:
\b
\li An easy-to-understand \em Readers' Version\em* side-by-side with a very \em Literal Version\em*
\li A generous open license so that the \em Open English Translation\em* can be
freely used in any Bible app or website, or printed in your church Bible-study notes
without even needing to request permission.
\li The \em Readers' Version\em* speaks like people around you.
Because the history and legacy of English Bibles now goes back for hundreds of years,
many things have been carried over that readers don't even realise.
For example, we all smile at Yoda saying, “Strong is the force.”
That's because naturally we would say, “The force is strong.”
So think about “Great is your faithfulness.”
(At least Miles Coverdale improved it in 1535 if you look carefully.)
But our aim isn't at all to criticise those who came before (because we very-much build on their shoulders)—we
just want our readers to be able to share the Good News of Jesus the Messiah
with others, without them thinking that Christians speak like dinosaurs (or Yoda)!
\li The \em Readers' Version\em* has section headings and cross-references
and most of the other features that help modern Bible readers.
\li The \em Readers' Version\em* uses modern units for all measurements (easy to understand and visualise),
whereas the \em Literal Version\em* retains the ancient units (useful for historical and symbolic studies).
\li The \em Readers' Version\em* uses well-known figures of speech,
or if the original figure of speech is not readily understandable,
explains the point that the author appears to be trying to express.
On the other hand, the \em Literal Version\em* retains the original figurative language
(even if it's not a figure of speech that we are familiar with).
\li \it Up\it* and \it down\it* in the original languages (and thus in the \em Literal Version\em*)
refer to \it uphill\it* and \it downhill\it*.
However, in the \em Readers' Version\em*, \it up\it* and \it down\it* are used to refer
to \it north\it* and \it south\it* respectively as per our modern norm.
\li The \em Readers' Version\em* is less formal than most modern English Bible translations,
for example, we would use contracted words like \it we'll\it* and \it didn't\it*,
especially when it's in direct speech.
(Always remember that the Bible was written in the languages of the common people.)
\li The \em Readers' Version\em* uses section headings
which are very helpful to skim through when trying to locate a certain passage.
However, you'll quickly notice that they are formatted in such a way
as not to break the flow of the letter or narrative.
This is to visually help the reader to appreciate the full context
of the part they're reading,
and not to ignore the connections with what came before and what follows.
\m We've also tried to focus our section headings on principles that are being taught,
rather than just focusing on the events happening at the time.
\m We'll also be providing a list of these section headings that you can quickly skim through
(and we hope to include extra, alternative headings).
\li Being a 21\sup st\sup* century translation done in an era
when there is much more effort in general to respect speakers of other languages
(including the languages of ethnic minorities in our own countries)
and to pronounce their names and placenames correctly,
the \em OET\em* attempts to do the same for Biblical names and placenames.
(All this is a little complex when we have both Hebrew and Greek versions of names and placenames—more below.)
Certainly by showing a little more respect for Hebrew names,
we hope to make this Bible translation a little more “Jew-friendly”.
If you have difficulty following the names in the \em Literal Version\em*,
you can always look across to the \em Literal Version\em*.
(Most English readers looking at names in the Bible all the way from \it Jericho\it* to \it Jesus\it*
would have no idea that there's no \bd J\bd* letter or sound in either Hebrew or Greek,
plus there's absolutely no such name as \it James\it* in the New Testament manuscripts!)
\li In addition to wanting to get names and placenames more accurate,
we've also attempted to modernise and simplify the spelling (transliterations) of these names
to make it easier for readers to pronounce them as they come across them,
e.g., using \bd f\bd* instead of \bd ph\bd*, so \it Epafras\it* instead of \it Epaphras\it*.
(Oddly, even traditional English Bible translations surprisingly
do use \it Felix\it* and \it Festus\it*.)
\li With regular words, we've tried to do the opposite,
i.e., to use less Greek rather than more wherever possible.
So a word like \it baptise\it* (which is an adapted transliteration of the Greek verb),
actually gets translated, so this example becomes \it immerse\it*.
\li \it Italics\it* are only used for \em emphasis\em*, not to indicate \it added words\it* as historically done in
older translations due to limitations of the original printing processes.
The \em OET\em* fixes the problem where most modern printing uses \it italics\it* for \em emphasis\em*
whereas older Bibles use \it italics\it* for the words which should actually be \bd deemphasised\bd*,
i.e., the words which actually \bd aren't\bd* in the original manuscripts!
\li The English \it Christ\it* is an adapted transliteration of the Koine Greek word \it Kristos\it*
used for the original Hebrew \it Messiah\it*.
(It's not Jesus' surname!)
It seems to make sense to only use one word consistently
rather than using two words for the same thing
(just because they came from two different languages),
so the \em OET\em* has elected to only use \it Messiah\it*.
However, these words actually have a meaning, just as \it President\it* is not just a title,
but someone who \it presides\it* over governmental meetings.
So going a step further, we have chosen to use the contemporary
\bd meaning\bd* of the word in the \em Literal Version\em*.
The original meaning is \it one who is anointed\it* (by pouring a hornful of oil over them),
but we use the extended meaning which is \it one who is selected/chosen (by God)\it*.
\li Most readers living in modern democracies
have never been familiar with the concept of an ancient king or \it lord\it*
who has the power of life and death over them.
Thus the title \it Lord Jesus\it* is easily said,
yet relatively few actually live with Jesus as the lord of their thoughts and actions and daily activities.
(Just think how many would embarrassingly rush to turn off the video they're streaming
if Jesus appeared in the room.)
As a reaction to the word \it Lord\it* seemingly becoming so cliché for many Christians,
we use the translation \it master\it* as a way to get readers to at least
think a little more about what the concept might mean.
(The word \it boss\it* felt a little informal.)
\li The \em Literal Version\em* tries to add as little as possible
that's not actually there in the original manuscripts.
Of course, we add spaces between words so we can read it faster,
and we add capitals at the start of sentences as per standard, modern English,
but we don't capitalise words like \it Kingdom of Heaven\it*
or even \it He\it* when it refers to Jesus,
because the concept of capital and small letters didn't even exist
when original manuscripts like the portion visible at
https://greekcntr.org/manuscripts/data/1G20001.htm were written.
(Our policy has more to do with accuracy and education
than it does with “lack of respect” or any such thing.
Often this goes against religious tradition of the last few centuries,
but just because something is traditional,
does not necessarily mean that it is correct or even helpful.)
\li Most dialects of modern English don't distinguish between \it you (singular)\it* referring to just one person,
and \it you (plural)\it* referring to a group of people.
However, the original languages clearly distinguish these,
so in order to indicate this to our readers
the \em Literal Version\em* uses \it you\em _\em*all\it* for the plural form
(although we are aware that some modern dialects now prefer \it yous\it*).
\li Because the \em Literal Version\em* so closely follows the original languages,
it's important to remember that words often don't match one-to-one between languages.
This is one reason why the \em OET-LV\em* reads strangely:
because we try to avoid using different English words if we can;
knowing that the \em OET-LV\em* will not be natural English.
Again, this is because we want the \em OET-LV\em* to be
a window into what's actually written in the original languages.
For fluent English (like in the \em Readers' Version\em*) the same Greek word
might require several different translations when used in different contexts.
For example, the Greek word translated \it raise\it* in the \em OET-LV\em*
would likely require the following changes:

\li to \it raise\it* from sitting, we'd want: \it stand up\it*
\li to \it raise\it* from bed, we'd want: \it get up\it*
\li to \it raise\it* from the grave, we'd want: \it come back to life\it*
\li to \it raise\it* an object, we'd want: \it lift up\it*
\li to \it raise\it* a person, we'd often want: \it exalt\it* or \it praise\it*

\m Alert readers might be aware that there's a play on words here in the gospels.
When Jesus talked about himself \it being raised up\it*, it was deliberately ambiguous
because his hearers didn't understand until right near the end that he was going to be executed.
So we, looking back in history, know that he was talking about coming back to life,
but at the time, they were just very confused and didn't understand what he meant.
But amazingly, as well as referring to his resurrection, \it raising\it* also refers to his crucifixion
as the victims on the stakes were also \it raised\it*. (See John 3:14.)
Sadly, it's not usually possible to make a translation easy to read and understand in our current times,
without losing some of the underlying meaning or ambiguities or word-plays that were presented to the original hearers.
That's exactly why it's good to have \em two\em* different translations side-by-side!

\li These particular pages use British spelling,
but American spelling will also be available in the future.
\li Our preference in most editions is to place \em The Gospel according to John\em*
\bd before\bd* \em Matthew\em*.
This has a couple of advantages:

\li The Old Testament starts with “In the beginning, Elohim created…”
and the New Testament starts with “In the beginning was the Messenger…”.
\li \em Acts\em* ends up right after the first book by its author \em Luke\em*.
\li It just reminds readers that the order of the “books” in the Bible
is not set by sacred degree--only by tradition.

\m Some do complain that the traditional order of the first four gospel accounts
represent the lion, the calf, the man, and the eagle of Rev 4:6-7
which allegedly match with the banners (not described in the Bible) of the four divisions
of the tribes of Israel mentioned in Numbers 2.
\li Beware of some traps interpreting the \em Literal Version\em*.
Because it's not designed to be used alone (but rather alongside the \em Readers' Version\em*)
it's \bd much more literal\bd* than most other “literal versions”.
You'll quickly notice lighter colours that mark the deemphasis of words
that had to be added to make the English sentences even make sense.
But there's at least two other things that aren't necessarily changed
in the English \em Literal Version\em*:

\li Other languages use the negative differently,
especially when it's doubled or tripled in the sentence.
If you don't understand this,
you could easily think that the original means the opposite of what the words actually appear to say.
For example the double negative:
“You are\em _\em* not \em _\em*caring\em _\em*about
no one.” (adapted from Matthew 22:16).
In natural, fluent English, we would have to reverse the second negative to get the expected meaning,
ending up with \it anyone\it* as you'll find in the \em Readers' Version\em*.
But in Greek, the second negative adds emphasis rather than reversing the first negative.
So our \em Literal Version\em* shows you the words that are actually there
(in the Greek in this case).
\li Other languages may omit (or \it elide\it*) words which are clearly implied to the original reader,
but which the modern English reader finds strange,
e.g., a son may be divided against his father, and a daughter her mother.
The elided words are “may be divided against”.
\m Always check the \em Readers' Version\em* carefully for how it is translated into modern, idiomatic English
before jumping to any conclusions of your own about what the original language
or the \em Literal Version\em* says or doesn't say.
