\mt2 The account of Yeshua's ministry by
\mt1 Yohan (John)
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua (Jesus) was written by Yohan (John), brother of Yacob (mistakenly known in older English Bibles as James). Both of them were in the small group of twelve close followers of Yeshua that he selected as his apprentices and who accompanied him around as he taught. Out of the twelve, Yohan was the one that greatly loved Yeshua, and his closeness gave him much of the insight that he includes with his description of Yeshua's actions and teaching. The two brothers were the sons of Zebedee, and all three of them worked as fishermen on Lake Galilee.
\is2 This account
\ip The \em Open English Translation\em* places Yohan's account before the others because it begins with the eternal existence of Yeshua the messiah. Not only is Yeshua the godly messenger, he was also the creator who has now descended from heaven as a man. Omitting any mention of the baby Yeshua, Yohan does however tell us about Yohan-the-immerser who came before Yeshua to prepare the people for the arrival of the promised messiah.
\ip In chapters two to twelve it's written how the various miracles that Yeshua did showed that he was the promised messiah who would offer life without ending to anyone who would accept that he had been sent by God and trust in his teaching. Although there were indeed many who did believe in him, many others were unable to come to that point and ended up opposing Yeshua at every turn.
\ip In chapters thirteen to seventeen, the compassion of Yeshua towards his followers is described. He also told them in advance of his impending brutal death.
\ip In the final few chapters, we read about the arrest and judging of Yeshua, his being fastened to a pole and giving up his spirit, his coming back to life, and how his followers saw him and spoke with him again during that period.
\ip Yohan is careful to explain how to receive life without ending by means of believing that Yeshua came down from heaven and obeying his teaching. Yeshua himself is the path and the truth and the life (14:6).

\p
\v 1 In the beginning¦62339 was the message,\f + \fr 1:1 \ft TD: This passage is complex to translate because the message was also the messenger—that is, Yeshua came not only to teach about getting saved, but also to become the actual way to be saved!\f* and the message was with God, and the message was \add and is\add* God.
\v 2 He, \add the message\add*, was with \nd God¦62362\nd* \add even\add* at the creation¦62359 \add of the universe\add*.
\v 3 Everything came into existence through¦62364 the messenger\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Lit. him.\f*—\add ≈there's not even one thing that came into existence that wasn't made by\add* him.
\v 4 He holds life, and that life is the light¦62387 of humankind.
\v 5 And that light¦62392 is shining¦62396 in the darkness, and¦62390 darkness cannot overcome him.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt Mat 3:1; Mrk 1:4; Luk 3:1-2.\x*A man¦62404 arrived who had been sent¦62405 by \nd God¦62409\nd*. His name¦62412 was Yohan.
\v 7 He came as a testimony¦62420 to tell about the light so that everyone would believe¦62428 the light.
\v 8 Yohan himself wasn't the light—he was merely the announcer of the light.
\v 9 The true light¦62445 which¦62448 enlightens¦62449 every¦62450 person¦62451 was coming¦62452 into the world¦62455.
\p
\v 10 He was in the world and he's the creator of the world, and yet the world didn't¦62472 even know him.
\v 11 He came¦62477 to his own chosen people, but they wouldn't accept him¦62481,
\v 12 however anyone who would accept him and trusted in his¦62501 authority, he gave¦62488 them the right¦62492 to become¦62495 children¦62493 of \nd God¦62494\nd*—
\v 13 not physical children and not coming from human actions, but¦62514 children of \nd God¦62516\nd*.
\p
\v 14 And the message¦62521 became¦62523 a human and lived here among¦62526 us and we¦62529 saw¦62529 his¦62532 greatness—the greatness of an only child of the father¦62537—full of grace¦62540 and truth¦62542.
\p
\v 15 Yohan explained about him and loudly told everyone, “\add ≈He's\add* the one I meant when I said¦62554, ‘There's someone coming¦62560 after¦62558 me, yet who came before me, because¦62565 he existed before I did!’ ”
\p
\v 16 Because¦62569 he has so much, we all received¦62578 grace and then even more grace.
\v 17 The commands came to us through Mosheh, but grace¦62592 and truth¦62595 came to us through \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦62598\nd*.
\v 18 No one has ever actually seen¦62602 God, but the human son born from God the father¦62617 and in close touch with him, he was the one to explain¦62619 God to us.

\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-18)
\p
\v 19 Yohan explained some of this when the Jewish leaders sent¦62629 out priests¦62637 and¦62638 temple workers from Yerushalem to ask¦62643 him¦62646, “Who are you¦62648?”
\p
\v 20 He didn't¦62654 flinch from the truth and¦62651 so he told them, “I am not the \nd chosen¦62664 messiah¦62664\nd*.”
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21: a \xt Mal 4:5; \xo b \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*So¦62665 they asked him again, “Are you Eliyah come back to life?”
\p And he answered, “No, I'm not.”
\p They asked, “Are you the prophet¦62687?”
\p Again he answered, “No, I'm not.”
\p
\v 22 So¦62694 they asked him¦62695, “Who are you then? We need to give¦62701 an answer¦62700 to the ones who sent¦62703 us. How do you describe yourself¦62709?”
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*So he said, “I am a voice¦62712 shouting¦62713\f + \fr 1:23 \ft We've deliberately omitted putting a comma here, because it's also possible that the comma should go after ‘wilderness’.\f* in the wilderness smooth the path¦62719 of \nd Yahweh¦62720\nd*, as the prophet¦62730 Isayah said.”
\p
\v 24 Some of the ones sent¦62733 out were members of the Pharisee party¦62737.
\v 25 These ones asked¦62739 Yohan, “So¦62738 why are you immersing¦62746 people then¦62738 if you aren't¦62749 the \nd messiah¦62752\nd* or Eliyah or the prophet¦62759?”
\p
\v 26 He answered¦62760, “I'm immersing¦62766 people in water¦62770, but somewhere here among us all there's someone you don't¦62779 know—
\v 27 the one coming¦62786 after¦62784 me, and I'm not even good enough to untie¦62799 his¦62800 sandal¦62805 straps¦62803!”
\p
\v 28 All this happened in Bethany¦62810 on the east side of the Yordan¦62815 River where¦62817 Yohan was immersing¦62821 people.

\p
\v 29 The next day¦62824 Yohan saw \nd Yeshua\nd* coming¦62831 towards him¦62833, and¦62834 said, “Hey! Here's the sacrificial lamb of \nd God¦62840\nd* who's come to take away the sin¦62845 of the world¦62848.
\v 30 This is the man¦62861 I was talking about when I said¦62855, ‘There's someone coming¦62860 after me, yet who came before me, because¦62866 he¦62869 existed before I did.’
\v 31 I didn't¦62871 know who he was but¦62874 nevertheless I came¦62882 and¦62870 immersed¦62887 people in water¦62886 so that this man could be revealed¦62876 to \add all\add* Yisrael.”
\p
\v 32 And Yohan further explained, “I saw God's \nd spirit¦62896\nd* come down and¦62905 settle on him¦62909.
\v 33 I didn't¦62913 know which one was him, but the one who sent me to immerse people in water¦62923 said, ‘When you see the spirit coming¦62935 down and¦62910 settling on someone, he is the one who will immerse people with God's holy spirit.’
\v 34 And I have seen¦62952 that, and¦62951 so I can assure you that he is God's son.”

\p
\v 35 The next day¦62964, Yohan was back there with two¦62975 of his¦62974 apprentices¦62973
\v 36 and¦62976 noticing \nd Yeshua\nd* walking¦62980 nearby he said, “Look¦62982! There's the \add sacrificial\add* lamb of \nd God¦62986\nd*.”
\p
\v 37 When his¦63001 two¦63000 apprentices¦63002 heard¦62996 him say that, they left him and¦62995 followed¦63007 \nd Yeshua\nd*.
\v 38 But¦63024 \nd Yeshua\nd* turned¦63010 and saw them following¦63017 him, and asked them, “\wj What do you two want?\wj*”
\p And they said¦63025 to him, “Teacher¦63032, where do you live?”
\p
\v 39 “\wj Come and see,\wj*” Yeshua replied. So¦63042 they went¦63041 with him and saw¦63044 where¦63045 he lived, and then they stayed there that night, because it was already late afternoon.
\p
\v 40 Andrew¦63062, the brother¦63064 of Simon¦63065 Peter¦63066 was one of those two¦63071 who heard¦63073 Yohan and¦63076 then followed¦63077 Yeshua.
\v 41 As soon as he found his brother¦63085, he said to Simon¦63088, “We have found the messiah—God's chosen one,”
\v 42 and led him to Yeshua. When Yeshua saw him, he said¦63113, “\wj Ah, you are Simon¦63117, Yohan's son, but from now on you'll be called¦63123 Peter which¦63125 means \+it stone\+it*.\wj*”

\rem /s1 Jesus Calls Philip and Nathanael
\p
\v 43 The following¦63146 day¦63129, \nd Yeshua\nd* wanted¦63131 to go to Galilee¦63137. He found Philip¦63140 and¦63141 told him¦63143, “\wj Follow me!\wj*”
\v 44 Philip¦63151 was from the town of Bethsaida¦63153 where Andrew¦63158 and¦63159 Peter¦63160 lived.
\v 45 Philip then found \nd Nathanael¦63164\nd* and told him¦63167, “We've¦63177 found the one that Mosheh and the prophets¦63176 wrote¦63169 about in the Scriptures. He's \nd Yeshua\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦63187\nd*.”
\p
\v 46 And \nd Nathanael¦63191\nd* said¦63189, “Does anything good¦63196 come from \nd Nazareth¦63193\nd*?”
\p So¦63188 Philip¦63202 answered, “Well, come and¦63204 see¦63205 \add for yourself\add*.”
\p
\v 47 \nd Yeshua\nd* saw¦63206 \nd Nathanael¦63212\nd* approaching and¦63216 said, “\wj Ah, this is an honest Israeli¦63224.\wj*”
\p
\v 48 But \nd Nathanael¦63232\nd* queried him, “Where do you know \em me\em* from?”
\p And \nd Yeshua\nd* replied, “\wj Actually I saw¦63251 you under¦63248 that fig¦63250 tree¦63250 before Philip¦63245 had even called you.\wj*”
\p
\v 49 \nd Nathanael¦63255\nd* exclaimed, “Great teacher! You \em are\em* God's son! You're the king¦63271 of Yisrael!”
\p
\v 50 \nd Yeshua\nd* responded¦63279, “\wj So you believe¦63293 this because I said that I had seen you under the fig¦63291 tree¦63291. You'll get to see much greater¦63294 things than that!\wj*”
\v 51 \x + \xo 1:51: \xt Gen 28:12.\x*And he continued, “\wj Honestly, I'm telling all of you: you'll be seeing¦63309 the sky opened¦63312 up and God's messengers¦63315 going¦63318 up and coming¦63320 down on me—humanity's child.\wj*”

\s1 The wine miracle

\p
\v 1 On the Tuesday\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or possibly, ‘Three days later’.\f*, there was a wedding¦63332 in Cana¦63337 in Galilee¦63339, and¦63340 \nd Yeshua's\nd* mother¦63343 was there
\v 2 and \nd Yeshua¦63351\nd* and his¦63356 apprentices¦63355 were also invited¦63347.
\v 3 When the wine ran out at the wedding, his mother¦63376 said to him¦63381, “They haven't got any more wine.”
\p
\v 4 \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj What does that have to do with us, mother? It's not the time for my¦63402 ministry yet.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 But his¦63406 mother¦63405 told the servants¦63408, “Just do whatever¦63409 he tells you.”
\p
\v 6 Now there were six¦63423 empty stone¦63421 water¦63422 jars there that are used for Jewish purification¦63427 ceremonies. (Each one could hold over 70 litres.)
\v 7 So¦63448 \nd Yeshua\nd* told them to fill the jars with water¦63447, and¦63448 they¦63449 filled¦63449 them up.
\v 8 Then¦63453 he said, “\wj Okay, now take a sample out and¦63453 give it to the MC.\wj*” So¦63453 they took some
\v 9 and¦63467 when the MC tasted¦63468 the water that had now turned to wine, not knowing¦63477 where¦63478 it had come from he called the groom
\v 10 and exclaimed, “Most people supply the best wine at the beginning \add of the reception\add*, and the cheaper stuff when people are a bit tipsy. But you've kept¦63513 the best wine until¦63517 last!”
\p
\v 11 This event in Cana¦63530, Galilee¦63533, was the first of the miracles that \nd Yeshua\nd* did, and it revealed¦63536 his greatness and his followers believed¦63541 that he was from God.

\v 14 There in the temple¦63601, he discovered merchants selling¦63603 cows¦63605 and sheep¦63608 and doves¦63612, and moneychangers¦63616 sitting¦63617 at their tables.
\v 15 Yeshua formed some cords¦63624 into a whip and drove the sheep¦63635 and cows¦63638 out of the temple¦63630 grounds, and he overturned¦63651 the tables¦63649—spilling the coins¦63646 of the moneychangers¦63641 onto the ground.
\v 16 He scolded the ones selling¦63658 doves¦63657, saying, “\wj Get them out of here! Don't be making¦63665 my¦63670 father's¦63669 house into a market.\wj*”
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Psa 69:9.\x*That reminded¦63675 his¦63679 followers of the scripture: “I'll be filled with zeal for your¦63690 temple.”
\p
\v 18 Then the Jewish leaders responded¦63699, “Do a miracle to show that you have the authority to do these¦63706 things.”
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 2:19: \xt Mat 26:61; 27:40; Mrk 14:58; 15:29.\x*But \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦63708, “\wj Well, destroy this temple¦63716 and I'll raise\f + \fr 2:19 \ft We couldn't easily use \+em rebuild\+em* here because there's a play on words—see verse 21.\f* it¦63723 again in three¦63720 days¦63721.\wj*”

\p
\v 21 But Yeshua had been meaning his¦63754 own body¦63753 when he was talking¦63748 about the temple¦63751.
\v 22 In the future when he was actually raised¦63758 from the dead¦63760, his¦63764 followers remembered this statement, and they believed¦63771 both the \add Hebrew\add* scriptures¦63773 and \nd Yeshua's\nd* message¦63776.

\v 1 After dark one evening, a Jewish leader named Nicodemus¦63851 who was a member of the Pharisee party¦63850
\v 2 went¦63860 to Yeshua and said¦63868, “Teacher, we know that God has sent you as a teacher¦63876, because¦63879 no one could do those kinds of miracles if God wasn't with him.”

\p
\v 4 Nicodemus questioned, “How can an adult be reborn? A person¦63928 can't¦63935 just return into their mother's¦63941 womb and¦63945 then get born a second¦63943 time!”
\p
\v 5 But \nd Yeshua\nd* continued, “\wj Honestly, I'm telling¦63953 you¦63954: unless a person is born from both water¦63961 \+em and¦63962\+em* the \+nd spirit¦63963\+nd*, they can't¦63956 enter God's kingdom¦63971.\wj*

\p
\v 9 Nicodemus replied, “How can all that even happen?”
\p
\v 10 “\wj You're a Jewish teacher¦64052,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦64043, “\wj and yet you¦64058 don't¦64057 know all that?\wj*
\v 11 \wj It's true that we just teach what we know, and explain what we've seen¦64069 ourselves, but you people aren't¦64076 accepting our¦64074 testimony¦64073.\wj*

\v 22 After¦64308 this, \nd Yeshua\nd* and his¦64320 followers went¦64310 down to Yudea, and stayed there¦64327 and immersed¦64332 some believers.
\v 23 Yohan¦64337 was also immersing¦64338 people at Aenon¦64340 near Salim¦64344 because¦64345 there was plenty of water¦64346 there and¦64334 people would come \add to him\add* to get immersed¦64353.
\v 24 \x + \xo 3:24: \xt Mat 14:3; Mrk 6:17; Luk 3:19-20.\x*(At this point in time, Yohan had not yet been put in prison¦64360.)
\v 25 Then a debate¦64366 about¦64376 purification¦64377 started between Yohan's followers and a religious leader.\f + \fr 3:25 \ft https://www.billmounce.com/monday-with-mounce/what-does-the-word-%E2%80%9Cjew%E2%80%9D-mean-you-john-3-25\f*
\v 26 So¦64378 some people went¦64380 to Yohan and said¦64385, “Teacher, that man that came¦64380 to you across the river and that you testified¦64398 about, now \em he's\em* immersing¦64402 people and so they're all going to him.”
\p
\v 27 “None of us get anything if it's not being given¦64426 from heaven¦64430,” Yohan answered¦64408.
\v 28 \x + \xo 3:28: \xt Yhn 1:20.\x*“You yourselves know that I said¦64436 that I'm not the \nd messiah¦64443\nd*, but¦64444 rather the one coming before¦64448 him.
\v 29 It's the groom that has the bride¦64454—the best man is happy because¦64470 he sees that the groom is happy. So¦64476 I'm actually completely happy with all this.
\v 30 It's right and proper that he should increase¦64485 and I should fade out.”

\v 31 “The one who came down from heaven is greater than any of us. We came from this world and speak¦64511 in our earthly ways. The one who came down from heaven is greater than any of us.
\v 32 He explains about what he's seen¦64524 and¦64525 heard¦64526, but¦64529 people don't believe him¦64532.
\v 33 Anyone who does believe him¦64537, confirms that \nd God¦64545\nd* is true.

\p
\v 1 When \nd Yeshua\nd* found out that the Pharisee party¦64618 knew¦64611 that he was gaining and immersing¦64625 more followers than Yohan had,
\v 2 (although actually it wasn't \nd Yeshua¦64630\nd* himself¦64631 that was immersing¦64634 them, but¦64635 his¦64638 apprentices¦64637 that were doing it),
\v 3 he left Yudea¦64641 and went¦64644 back up to Galilee¦64648.
\v 4 On the way up, he decided to go through Samaria¦64655 \add (Heb. Shomron)\add*.
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 4:5: \xt Gen 33:19; Josh 24:32.\x*By choosing that route, they came to a town in Samaria¦64661 called¦64662 Sukar, which¦64667 was near the place that the \add patriarch\add* Yosef had inherited from his¦64675 father Yacob¦64670,
\v 6 and ‘Yacob's well’ was there¦64678. \nd Yeshua\nd* was tired from all the walking and was sitting¦64689 by the well around midday.
\p
\v 7 A woman¦64705 came from the town to get water¦64710 from the well, and \nd Yeshua\nd* asked her¦64712 for a drink¦64717
\v 8 since his¦64721 followers had gone into the town to buy some lunch.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 4:9: \xt Est 4:1-5; Neh 4:1-2.\x*The woman said to him, “You're a Jew. How come you're asking me for a drink¦64743 when I'm from Samaria?” (Jews don't¦64751 normally associate¦64753 with anyone from Samaria.)
\p
\v 10 \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦64757, “\wj If you'd recognised God's gift¦64766 and who it is who's asking you for a drink, you would have asked me and I would have given you \+em living¦64787\+em* water¦64786 \+add to drink\+add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 11 But the woman¦64793 \add ≈countered\add*, “Mister¦64794, you don't even have \add rope and\add* a bucket¦64797 to reach the water in the deep well. How then could you get ‘living¦64817 water’?
\v 12 I doubt that you're greater¦64820 than our¦64825 ancestor Yacob¦64826 who made this well for us and drank¦64841 this water along with his children and his animals.”
\p
\v 13 \nd Yeshua\nd* \add ≈responded¦64854\add*, “\wj Everyone¦64857 who drinks¦64859 this water¦64862 will get thirsty¦64864 again¦64865,\wj*
\v 14 \wj but whoever¦64866 drinks¦64871 the water that I give them will find a well springing up inside them—springing into eternal¦64904 life¦64903.\wj*”
\p
\v 15 So the woman¦64909 said, “Okay, then. Give me some of that water¦64915 so that I won't get thirsty¦64918 and won't have to keep coming out here to the well.”
\p
\v 16 Yeshua said, “\wj First, go and get your¦64938 husband¦64937 and then come¦64940 back here.\wj*”
\p
\v 17 “\add Actually,\add* I don't have a husband!” she \add ≈retorted\add*.
\p “\wj True enough—indeed you don't,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* said.
\v 18 “\wj You've had five¦64964 husbands¦64966 and you're not married to the man you're living with, so what you said was true.\wj*”
\p
\v 19 “Mister¦64985, I can see that you're¦64990 a prophet¦64988,” the woman¦64984 \add ≈reacted\add*.
\v 20 “Our¦64993 ancestors¦64992 worshipped on this mountain¦64997, but you¦65001 Jews claim that people should only worship there in Yerushalem.”
\p
\v 21 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* told her, “\wj You need to believe¦65018 that I was sent from God, woman¦65021, because¦65022 a day is coming¦65023 when everyone will be worshipping¦65038 him neither¦65027 on this mountain¦65031, nor in Yerushalem.\wj*
\v 22 \wj You people in Samaria don't¦65044 even know who you¦65045 worship, but we do, because¦65050 people will be saved by means of us Jews.\wj*
\v 23 \wj But a time is coming¦65058, starting even now, when the true worshippers will be worshipping the father in spirit¦65071 and truth¦65073, because¦65075 those are the ones that he is wanting to worship him.\wj*
\v 24 \wj \+nd God¦65088\+nd* is spirit, and the ones worshipping him must worship in spirit and total honesty.\wj*”
\p
\v 25 The woman¦65105 said, “I'm aware that the messiah is coming¦65110—God's chosen one. Whenever he appears, he'll teach us everything.”
\p
\v 26 “\wj \+em I am\+em* the messiah,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* responded. “\wj Yes, he's speaking¦65129 to you¦65130!\wj*”
\rem /s1 The Disciples Rejoin Jesus
\p
\v 27 After this, his¦65139 followers arrived back, and¦65131 they were astounded that he was speaking with a woman¦65145. However no one dared ask her, “What are you after¦65132?” Or to ask him, “Why are you talking¦65146 with her?”
\p
\v 28 So¦65162 the woman¦65170 left her¦65167 water¦65166 jar there, and went¦65172 back into the town where she told the people¦65179,
\v 29 “Come and see¦65181 a man¦65182 who knew as much about me as I know myself! He must be the \nd messiah¦65195\nd*!”
\v 30 So they¦65203 went¦65197 out from the town to go and¦65202 see Yeshua.
\p
\v 31 Meanwhile, Yeshua's followers encouraged him, “Teacher, here, eat.”
\p
\v 32 But he¦65219 said¦65221, “\wj I've had food to eat¦65226 that you¦65228 don't¦65229 know about.\wj*”
\p
\v 33 This made his followers ask each other, “Did you see anyone¦65242 bring him¦65244 something¦65244 to eat¦65245?”
\p
\v 34 “\wj Obeying God who sent¦65259 me is like food to me, and¦65261 I plan to finish his¦65263 work,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* explained.
\v 35 “\wj Don't you all have a saying about needing to wait four months¦65271 for a harvest? But I'm telling you that you all should open your¦65285 eyes¦65284 and look at the fields¦65289, because¦65290 they're already¦65295 lightening up as harvest time approaches.\wj*
\v 36 \wj The harvester gets paid with a harvest that will last forever so that the ones who plant and the ones who harvest can all celebrate.\wj*
\v 37 \wj There's truth in the statement¦65325 that¦65332 one person plants and¦65334 a different person harvests.\wj*
\v 38 \wj I've sent¦65339 you all out to harvest where you haven't worked before—others¦65348 did the groundwork and you benefit from their¦65356 work.\wj*”
\rem /s1 Many Samaritans Believe
\p
\v 39 And many people of Samaria¦65368 came out of that town and¦65359 believed¦65364 that Yeshua is God because¦65369 the woman¦65373 had told them that he knew everything about her.
\v 40 So¦65390 when they all came¦65386, they asked him to stay in their town and they stayed on there¦65402 for a couple of days¦65404.
\p
\v 41 As a result of his¦65414 teaching, many more believed¦65410
\v 42 so then they told the woman, “We no longer¦65425 believe¦65432 just because¦65426 of what you said, but now that we've heard¦65436 him for ourselves¦65433, we can see that he really is the saviour¦65448 of the world¦65450.”

\v 43 After his two¦65456 days¦65457 in Samaria, Yeshua continued on up to Galilee¦65464.
\v 44 \x + \xo 4:44: \xt Mat 13:57; Mrk 6:4; Luk 4:24.\x*\nd He¦65468\nd* himself¦65465 had told them that no prophet¦65471 gets honoured¦65476 in his own home town.
\v 45 \x + \xo 4:45: \xt Yhn 2:23.\x*When he got to Galilee¦65485, the people accepted him, having¦65492 seen¦65492 everything that he'd done at the feast in Yerushalem because¦65505 they had also been down there.
\rem /s1 Jesus Heals an Official's Son
\p
\v 46 \x + \xo 4:46: \xt Yhn 2:1-11.\x*So¦65535 he went¦65514 again to Cana¦65525 there in Galilee¦65528 where¦65529 he had made the water¦65533 into wine. Now there was a royal¦65540 official¦65540 there, whose¦65541 son in Capernaum¦65546 was ill.
\v 47 When the official heard¦65548 that \nd Yeshua\nd* was coming¦65552 up from Yudea¦65556 to Galilee¦65559, he went¦65560 and asked him if he would come¦65569 and heal¦65572 his¦65573 son who was dying¦65578.
\v 48 \nd Yeshua\nd* said¦65579 to him¦65584, “\wj You people won't¦65586 believe¦65594 unless you see¦65591 miracles and other marvels.\wj*”
\p
\v 49 But the official¦65600 begged him¦65597, “Sir, please come¦65603 before¦65604 my¦65611 child¦65608 dies.”
\p
\v 50 “\wj Go back there and see,\wj*” Yeshua responded¦65629. “\wj Your¦65619 son will recover.\wj*”
\p The man¦65624 believed¦65622 what Yeshua had told him, and so he started off.
\v 51 On his way, his slaves¦65644 met him and reported¦65651 that the boy¦65658 was alive and well.
\p
\v 52 So¦65663 the official asked them what time it was that he got better¦65673, and they replied that the fever¦65687 had subsided around 1pm.
\v 53 The father¦65691 knew¦65688 that that was the time when Yeshua had told him that his son would recover, and as a result his whole¦65716 household¦65714 believed¦65710 \add that Yeshua came from God\add*.
\p
\v 54 This was the second¦65722 miracle that \nd Yeshua\nd* have done after leaving Yudea¦65731 and¦65719 going to Galilee¦65734.

\p
\v 1 After¦65735 all this, there¦65737 was another Jewish feast¦65739, so \nd Yeshua\nd* went¦65743 down to Yerushalem.
\v 2 In Yerushalem at the Sheep Gate, there's¦65748 the Bethsaida¦65766 pool that¦65758 has five¦65768 alcoves
\v 3 and a large number of sick, blind¦65780, lame, and paralysed¦65782 people¦65776 lie there in them.
\v 4 ◘
\v 5 One man¦65825 had been there¦65826 for thirty-eight years¦65832,
\v 6 and when \nd Yeshua\nd* noticed him and knew that he'd been there for so long, he asked, “\wj Do you want to get better?\wj*”
\p
\v 7 “Yes mister,” the sick man answered¦65864, “but¦65889 when the water¦65878 starts moving, I don't¦65872 have a companion to lift me into the pool, so someone else always get there before¦65893 me.”
\p
\v 8 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* said, “\wj Stand up and pick up your¦65907 bedroll and start walking¦65909.\wj*”
\v 9 The man immediately¦65911 stood up, picked up his¦65925 gear, and¦65910 started to walk¦65927.
\p However, this was the weekly rest day.
\v 10 \x + \xo 5:10: \xt Neh 13:19; Jer 17:21.\x*So¦65937 the religious leaders said to the man, “Hey! It's against the law for you to carry your¦65953 bedding¦65952 on the rest day¦65943!”
\p
\v 11 But the man answered¦65957, “The man who made me better told me to pick up my bedroll and¦65974 start walking¦65975.”
\p
\v 12 “Oh. Who was it that told you¦65986 to take that stuff and¦65992 start walking¦65993?”
\p
\v 13 But the man who had been healed¦65997 didn't¦65999 even know who it was, because \nd Yeshua\nd* had quickly left when a crowd¦66010 had formed.
\p
\v 14 Later on, \nd Yeshua\nd* found the man in the temple¦66027 and told him, “\wj Look¦66032, you're better now so don't go on sinning¦66036, because you don't want anything worse¦66039 to happen to you.\wj*”
\p
\v 15 The man¦66049 then went¦66045 and¦66050 told the leaders that it was \nd Yeshua\nd* who had made him¦66066 better.
\rem /s1 Life Through the Son
\rem /s1 Jesus Claims to Be the Son of God
\v 16 As a result, the leaders started harassing \nd Yeshua\nd* because he had done this on a rest day¦66090.
\v 17 But Yeshua just replied, “\wj My¦66100 father¦66099 is working today, and¦66104 so I'm also working.\wj*”
\p
\v 18 Because of this, the leaders became determined that he must be put to death—not just because he broke the rules for the rest day¦66123, but most of all because he was calling¦66128 God his own father¦66126, thus making¦66134 himself¦66133 equal¦66132 to God!
\s1 Authority over life is given to the son
\rem /s1 The Authority of the Son
\p
\v 19 So¦66139 \nd Yeshua\nd* responded to them, “\wj I want to tell you all something: The son can't¦66154 initiate anything¦66173 by himself¦66164. He can only do what he sees his father doing, because¦66181 whatever¦66180 his father is doing, he also does things like that.\wj*
\v 20 \wj You see, the father¦66197 loves his son and shows him everything that he's doing¦66209. In fact, he'll be showing him even greater¦66212 things than what he's done already, so that you all will be amazed¦66222.\wj*
\v 21 \wj Because¦66227 the father¦66229 brings the dead back to life, giving them new life, so too the son can give life to anyone who he wants.\wj*
\v 22 \wj The father¦66250 won't¦66246 be judging¦66251 anyone¦66252, but¦66253 has already given¦66257 that task to the son,\wj*
\v 23 \wj so that the people might honour the son like they honour the father. But anyone who is not honouring the son, is also dishonouring the father who sent him.\wj*
\p
\v 24 “\wj I assure you that anyone who hears my¦66290 message¦66289 and believes¦66293 that I was sent by God, will live forever and will not be condemned, but has moved from death¦66311 into life.\wj*
\v 25 \wj I can also assure you¦66318 that a time is coming¦66320, and in fact is here already, when the dead¦66327 will be hearing¦66330 the voice of God's son and that voice will bring them back to life.\wj*
\v 26 \wj As the father¦66346 is the source of life, he gave the power of giving life to the son\wj*
\v 27 \wj and gave¦66369 him the authority¦66367 to be the final judge¦66372, because¦66375 he is humanity's child.\wj*
\v 28 \wj Don't be surprised at this, because¦66382 a time is coming¦66383 when everyone in their graves will be hearing¦66398 his¦66401 voice¦66400,\wj*

\v 8 Now one of Yeshua's apprentices¦66895, Simon¦66900 Peter's brother¦66899, Andrew¦66897, said to Yeshua,
\v 9 “There's a young boy¦66903 here with five¦66909 buns and¦66912 two¦66913 \add small¦66903 cooked\add* fish¦66914, but¦66915 that wouldn't even start to feed this crowd.”
\p
\v 10 But¦66932 \nd Yeshua\nd* told them to get all the people¦66929 to sit¦66930 down as there¦66931 was a large grassy¦66934 area. So¦66932 they all sat¦66940 down—some five¦66950 thousand¦66950 men¦66944 were counted.
\v 11 Then he took the buns and gave¦66960 thanks¦66960 to God, and started passing around both the buns and the fish¦66977, and everyone ate as much as they wanted.
\v 12 Once everyone was full, Yeshua got his¦66986 apprentices¦66985 to collect the leftover¦66989 fragments¦66991 so as not to waste anything¦66994.
\v 13 So¦66999 they gathered¦66998 the leftovers and filled¦67002 twelve¦67006 baskets¦67007 with leftover bread.
\p
\v 14 The people¦67022 who had witnessed this and other miracles said, “This really is the prophet¦67038 that God promised to send!”
\v 15 But \nd Yeshua\nd* knew that they intended to come and grab him to proclaim him as their king¦67059, so he moved out of the crowd and on up the hill.

\p
\v 16 As it¦67074 moved into evening¦67073, Yeshua's apprentices¦67077 went¦67075 back down to the lake¦67081
\v 17 and having¦67084 boarded¦67084 the boat¦67087, they¦67088 set out across¦67092 the lake¦67094 toward Capernaum¦67096. By then¦67098 it was dark, and there was still no sign of \nd Yeshua\nd*.
\v 18 Then¦67119 a strong wind¦67122 hit the lake¦67121 and¦67119 the water got rough.
\v 19 When they had rowed¦67126 about¦67130 five¦67135 kilometres, they saw \nd Yeshua\nd* walking¦67141 on top of the lake¦67145 and approaching the boat¦67150, and they were very scared.
\v 20 But he told them, “\wj Don't worry—it's me.\wj*”
\v 21 After that¦67186 they were willing¦67164 to let him into the boat, and immediately¦67174 the boat was at their arrival place.

\p
\v 22 The next day, the crowd¦67192 looked across¦67195 the lake¦67197 and saw that only one small¦67202 boat had crossed, and they knew that only \nd Yeshua's\nd* apprentices had boarded that boat and left, and not Yeshua himself.
\v 23 Other boats¦67251 came¦67249 across from Tiberias¦67258 near the place¦67262 where¦67263 they¦67265 had eaten the bread¦67267 after the \nd master¦67270\nd* had given¦67268 thanks¦67268.
\v 24 So¦67273 when all the people saw¦67274 that Yeshua wasn't around and his¦67289 apprentices¦67288 had left, they went¦67303 off looking¦67306 for¦67306 Yeshua in Capernaum¦67305.

\rem /s1 Jesus the Bread of Life
\p
\v 25 When they found¦67311 him there across¦67313 the lake¦67315, they queried, “Teacher, how did you get here?”
\p
\v 26 “\wj Honestly, I know that you're not looking¦67334 for¦67334 me because you saw¦67338 \+add God working\+add* miracles,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦67324, “\wj but because you all had plenty of food to fill you up.\wj*
\v 27 \wj Don't \+add just\+add* work for the food which goes off, but¦67357 for the food which lasts forever—the food which humanity's child will give to you¦67371 because¦67374 \+nd God¦67379\+nd* the father¦67376 has put his mark of approval on him.\wj*”
\p
\v 28 Puzzled, they asked him¦67383, “What should we be doing if we want to work for \nd God¦67396\nd*?”
\p
\v 29 He answered, “\wj Doing God's work is putting your trust in the one that he sent¦67416 here.\wj*”
\p
\v 30 “If so,” they said¦67419, “what miracle will you do for us to see¦67432 so that we can believe¦67434 that you \add came from God\add*? What can \em you\em* do?
\v 31 \x + \xo 6:31: \xt Exo 16:4,15; Psa 78:24.\x*Our¦67440 ancestors¦67439 ate¦67443 the manna¦67442\f + \fr 6:31 \ft Manna was a word that meant ‘stuff’ and referred to some kind of flakes that regularly came down from the sky in the time of Mosheh and could be eaten as food.\f* out in the wilderness¦67446, just like Mosheh wrote¦67449, ‘He gave¦67455 them bread¦67451 from the sky to eat¦67458.’ ”
\p
\v 32 \nd Yeshua\nd* said to them, “\wj Actually I can tell you that it wasn't Mosheh who gave¦67470 them bread from heaven, but my¦67481 father¦67480 gives you the real bread from heaven,\wj*
\v 33 \wj because¦67493 God's bread¦67494 is the one who came down from heaven¦67503 and¦67504 who gives life¦67505 to the world¦67510.\wj*”
\p
\v 34 So¦67512 they¦67511 requested, “Mister¦67515, keep giving us that bread¦67521.”
\p
\v 35 “\wj \+em I am\+em* the bread¦67532 that gives life¦67534,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj anyone who comes to me will never hunger¦67541, and¦67544 the one believing¦67546 in me, will never be thirsty¦67551 again.\wj*
\v 36 \wj But as I said¦67556 already, although you have seen¦67560 me you refuse to believe¦67565 me.\wj*
\v 37 \wj Everyone¦67567 that the father¦67572 gives to me will come to me, and¦67576 I certainly won't¦67582 turn away anyone who comes to me,\wj*
\v 38 \wj because I came¦67587 down from heaven¦67591, not to do what I want, but¦67600 to do what the one who sent¦67604 me wants.\wj*
\v 39 \wj And what he wants is for me to not lose anyone that¦67618 he's given¦67619 to me, but to bring them back to life on the last day¦67635.\wj*
\v 40 \wj My¦67648 father¦67645 wants everyone¦67650 who watches me and believes¦67656 in me to live forever, because¦67638 I will bring them back to life¦67662 on that¦67651 final day¦67672.\wj*”
\p
\v 41 This little speech made the religious leaders grumble¦67673 about¦67678 him because¦67680 he had said¦67681 that he was the food that came down from heaven¦67690,
\v 42 as they figured out, “This is \nd Yeshua\nd* the son of Yosef and¦67691 so we know his parents. So¦67691 how can he say that he came¦67726 down from heaven¦67725?”
\p
\v 43 \nd Yeshua\nd* scolded them, “\wj Don't be grumbling¦67737 to each other.\wj*
\v 44 \wj No one can join me unless the father¦67748 who sent¦67751 me attracts them, and¦67757 then I'll be bringing them back to life on that final day¦67765.\wj*
\v 45 \x + \xo 6:45: \xt Isa 54:13.\x*\wj The prophets¦67770 wrote¦67767 that¦67779 the people will be taught¦67774 by \+nd God¦67776\+nd*. And everyone who's heard¦67781 and¦67785 learnt¦67786 from the father¦67784 comes to me.\wj*
\v 46 \wj Not that any person has seen the father—only the one who came from \+nd God¦67806\+nd* has seen him.\wj*
\v 47 \wj I tell you¦67816 sincerely: anyone who believes¦67819 \+add in me\+add* will live forever.\wj*
\v 48 \wj \+em I am\+em* the bread¦67828 that gives true life¦67830.\wj*
\v 49 \wj Your¦67833 ancestors¦67832 ate¦67834 manna¦67843 in the wilderness¦67841, but they¦67845 all went on to die.\wj*
\v 50 \wj But \+em I am\+em* the bread¦67849 that¦67850 came down from heaven¦67853 and¦67863 anyone¦67858 who eats this will not die¦67866.\wj*
\v 51 \wj \+em I am\+em* the living bread that¦67872 came down from heaven¦67877 and if anyone¦67881 eats this bread, he will live through to the next age.\wj*”
\p
\v 52 At this point, the religious leaders began to argue with each other, “How could this man give¦67932 us his¦67937 flesh¦67935 to eat¦67938?”
\p
\v 53 So¦67940 \nd Yeshua\nd* explained, “\wj Indeed if you don't¦67950 eat¦67952 my flesh¦67954 and drink¦67960 my blood¦67964, you aren't¦67950 truly¦67945 alive!\wj*
\v 54 \wj Anyone who eats my flesh¦67981 and drinks¦67983 my blood¦67987 will gain eternal¦67990 life—I will bring them back to life on that final day¦67999,\wj*
\v 55 \wj because¦68001 my flesh¦68002 is the true food, and¦68008 my blood¦68010 is the true drink¦68015.\wj*
\v 56 \wj Anyone who eats my flesh¦68054 and drinks¦68056 my blood¦68060 lives in me, and I will live in him¦68066.\wj*
\v 57 \wj The father is alive and sent me here, and I am alive because of Him, so also the person who eats me will be alive because of me.\wj*
\v 58 \wj Unlike your ancestors¦68137 who ate that bread \+add from the sky\+add* and then died, anyone who eats this bread that came down from heaven¦68130 will live through to the next age.\wj*”
\s1 Many people find the teaching too difficult
\p
\v 59 Yeshua taught¦68162 all of this in the meeting¦68160 hall¦68160 there in Capernaum¦68164.
\rem /s1 Many Disciples Desert Jesus
\rem /s1 The Words of Eternal Life
\v 60 But even many of his¦68172 followers who heard¦68168 it said¦68174, “This is difficult teaching—it's too hard to take.”
\p
\v 61 But \nd Yeshua\nd* already knew inside that his¦68204 followers were grumbling¦68199 about¦68200 this and asked them, “\wj Do you¦68210 find this offensive¦68211?\wj*
\v 62 \wj What¦68221 if you were to see humanity's child ascending to where¦68224 he came from?\wj*
\v 63 \wj It's the spirit that is the source of life, not the body¦68234. The concepts that I've taught you are all spiritual and life-giving.\wj*
\v 64 \wj But there¦68253 are some here who don't¦68261 believe me.\wj*” Actually, \nd Yeshua\nd* had already known¦68264 from the beginning¦68268 just who would believe and¦68277 which person would betray him¦68285
\v 65 so he said¦68291, “\wj That's why I told you that no one can come¦68296 to me unless the father¦68307 has given¦68303 them to me.\wj*”
\p
\v 66 After this, many of his¦68317 followers went¦68318 back and no longer¦68323 accompanied him around.
\p
\v 67 So¦68329 \nd Yeshua\nd* said¦68327 to his twelve¦68333 \add apprentices\add*, “\wj Don't you want to leave as well?\wj*”
\p
\v 68 \x + \xo 6:68-69: \xt Mat 16:16; Mrk 8:29; Luk 9:20.\x*“\nd Master¦68346\nd*,” Simon answered¦68339, “if we went, who would we follow then? You're the \add only\add* one who teaches about living forever.
\v 69 We believe¦68356 and¦68357 know that you¦68361 are the holy son of \nd God¦68369\nd*.”
\p
\v 70 \nd Yeshua\nd* responded, “\wj Didn't I choose all twelve¦68386 of you myself? And yet one of you is a devil¦68394.\wj*”
\v 71 (He was talking¦68396 about Yudas¦68399, Simon¦68400 Iscariot's son, because¦68405 he was the one who would go on to betray him.)

\s1 Yeshua's sceptical brothers dare him to go public
\rem /s1 Jesus Goes to the Feast of Tabernacles; The Unbelief of Jesus' Brothers; Jesus and His Brothers; The great controversy
\p
\v 1 After all this, \nd Yeshua\nd* travelled around Galilee¦68427. (He didn't¦68428 want to travel around Yudea¦68435 because¦68429 the leaders there wanted to execute him¦68439.)
\v 2 \x + \xo 7:2: \xt Lev 23:34; Deu 16:13.\x*As it¦68443 was now getting close to the Jewish Feast With Tents,
\v 3 his¦68459 brothers¦68458 said¦68453 to him, “You should leave this place and go down to Yudea¦68469 so that all your¦68474 followers can see the miracles that you're¦68484 doing¦68484.
\v 4 If you want to become well-known, you don't do things out of the main stream. If you want to do miracles, \add go and\add* show yourself¦68505 to the wider world¦68507.
\v 5 (You see, not even Yeshua's own \add half-\add*brothers believed¦68514 \add that he came from God\add*.)
\p
\v 6 So¦68520 \nd Yeshua\nd* responded, “\wj Well, you guys can do that any time, but it's not the right time for me yet.\wj*
\v 7 \wj All the people won't¦68541 hate you¦68548 guys, but¦68550 they do hate me because¦68552 I teach about the evil¦68562 things they are doing.\wj*
\v 8 \wj You all go¦68565 on down to Yerushalem ahead of me. I'm not going¦68573 to the feast yet because¦68578 it's not yet the right time¦68583 for me.\wj*”
\v 9 After saying this, Yeshua stayed up in Galilee¦68598.
\s1 Yeshua starts teaching about authentic justice
\rem /s1 Jesus at the Festival of Booths; Jesus at the Festival of Shelters; Jesus Teaches Openly at the Temple
\p
\v 10 But after his¦68605 \add half-\add*brothers had left to go down to Yerushalem, Yeshua also went—not in the public limelight but¦68601 just incognito so to speak.
\v 11 However at the celebrations, the Jewish religious leaders were searching for him, and were asking around where he was.
\p
\v 12 Even among¦68643 the crowds¦68646 there¦68641 was a lot of quiet banter with some saying that Yeshua is a good man and¦68635 others¦68655 complaining that he was misleading the people.
\v 13 Either way, no one was speaking¦68667 out in public¦68666 about him¦68670, because¦68672 they were afraid of the reaction of the religious leaders.
\rem /s1 Jesus Teaches at the Feast
\p
\v 14 Finally sometime in the middle¦68681 of the celebrations, \nd Yeshua\nd* went¦68682 into the temple¦68688 and¦68689 started teaching¦68690 in there.
\v 15 Even the Jewish leaders were surprised, asking, “How can this man know so much when he hasn't been trained as a teacher?”
\p
\v 16 \nd Yeshua\nd* himself responded¦68709, “\wj My teaching¦68712 doesn't come from me, but¦68716 from the one who sent¦68718 me.\wj*
\v 17 \wj If anyone¦68721 wants to do God's will, they'll soon figure out whether¦68732 my teaching¦68731 comes from God or if I'm just making it¦68737 up myself¦68741.\wj*
\v 18 \wj Any person who just teaches their own thoughts is just seeking their own advancement, but¦68754 anyone who wants to promote the one who sent¦68759 them, this is authentic and¦68764 there's no hidden self-interest.\wj*
\v 19 \wj Didn't Mosheh write down God's commands for you, yet not a single one of you obeys them. Why are you wanting to execute me?\wj*”
\p
\v 20 “You must be demon-possessed,” said some in the crowd¦68791, “Who would be wanting to execute you¦68797.”
\p
\v 21 \nd Yeshua\nd* responded¦68805, “\wj I did one miracle and you¦68813 were all amazed¦68813.\wj*
\v 22 \x + \xo 7:22: a \xt Lev 12:3; \xo b \xt Gen 17:10.\x*\wj Mosheh gave¦68818 you the command about circumcision (even though it actually came from before his time), but to obey this, you'll even circumcise a baby boy on the Rest Day.\wj*
\v 23 \x + \xo 7:23: \xt Yhn 5:9.\x*\wj So if a \+add baby\+add* boy can be circumcised¦68842 on the Rest Day so that Mosheh's commands aren't¦68849 broken¦68850, they why did you get angry¦68857 with me because¦68858 I made a man healthy¦68862 on the Rest Day?\wj*
\v 24 \wj Don't just ‘judge’ things so that you yourselves look good, but¦68871 judge impartially, seeking the best for others.\wj*”
\s1 Could Yeshua be the messiah?

\p
\v 25 After this, some of the locals from Yerushalem started asking, “Isn't this the man they¦68887 were wanting to execute?
\v 26 Well, here he is teaching in public¦68891, yet they're not even confronting him. Perhaps¦68899 the leaders know that he really is the \nd messiah¦68911\nd*?
\v 27 But we¦68914 even know where this man is from. Surely when the \nd messiah¦68920\nd* comes, no one would know his family background.”
\p
\v 28 So¦68938 as \nd Yeshua\nd* continued teaching¦68946, he called out, “\wj Indeed you all know me and my home and my family. But I didn't¦68963 come¦68964 here of my own accord, but the one who sent¦68970 me here is truthful, even though you don't¦68963 even know him.\wj*
\v 29 \wj I know him, because¦68980 I came from him, indeed, he was the one who sent¦68987 me here.\wj*”
\p
\v 30 So¦68992 now they really want to arrest¦68994 him, but no one touched him because¦69006 it was not yet the proper time.
\v 31 Many in the crowd¦69020 did believe¦69023 that¦69039 he was from God and they were saying¦69027, “When the \nd messiah¦69030\nd* comes, would he be doing¦69038 greater miracles than what we've seen this man¦69040 do?”

\v 32 The Pharisee party heard¦69043 the crowd¦69048 muttering about these¦69053 things and sent¦69055 out some of their servants along with the chief¦69059 priests¦69059 to go and arrest¦69067 Yeshua.
\v 33 So¦69070 \nd Yeshua\nd* said¦69069, “\wj I'll only be with you¦69080 all for a short while longer and¦69082 then I'll be going¦69083 to the one who sent¦69086 me.\wj*
\v 34 \wj You'll look for me but won't¦69092 be able to find me, and you can't¦69092 go where¦69096 I'll be going.\wj*”
\p
\v 35 The leaders wondered, “Where¦69110 could he be going that we wouldn't be able to find him? Will he go and live with the Jews living out there among the Greeks and start teaching¦69130 the Greeks?
\v 36 And what does he mean about looking¦69145 for¦69145 him and not being able to find him, and not being able to go where¦69152 he goes?”

\v 38 \x + \xo 7:38: \xt Eze 47:1; Zech 14:8.\x*\wj Whoever¦69196 trusts me will have rivers of living¦69203 water¦69202 flowing¦69201 out from him¦69200 just like the scriptures¦69195 say.\wj*”
\v 39 He was talking about God's spirit that the ones who trust him would receive¦69214 in the future—not yet because¦69223 \nd Yeshua\nd* hadn't been lifted up to heaven yet.

\v 41 Others¦69262 said, “He must be the messiah.”
\p But some pointed out, “The messiah won't¦69274 come from Galilee¦69278.

\v 43 And so the crowd¦69316 was divided about Yeshua.

\p
\v 46 They answered¦69361, “We've never¦69368 heard anyone speak like he does.”

\v 47 “Don't tell us that you've also been taken in by him?” the Pharisees asked them.

\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 8:12: \xt Mat 5:14; Yhn 9:5.\x*Because of this, \nd Yeshua\nd* told them, “\wj \+em I am\+em* the light for the world¦69754—whoever follows¦69756 me won't¦69759 walk in the darkness¦69764 but will have the light \+add that gives\+add* life¦69771.\wj*”
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 8:13: \xt Yhn 5:31.\x*Some from the Pharisee party¦69776 argued, “You are testifying¦69780 about¦69778 yourself¦69779, so that testimony¦69782 is invalid.”
\p
\v 14 \nd Yeshua\nd* responded¦69791, “\wj Even when I am testifying about¦69798 myself¦69799, my¦69806 testimony¦69805 is valid, because¦69809 I know where I came¦69812 from and where I'm going.\wj*
\v 15 \wj You all are judging according¦69827 to your earthly values. I'm not judging anyone¦69836.\wj*
\v 16 \wj But even if I was judging, my judgement¦69844 would be correct, because¦69850 it wouldn't just be me judging, but also the father¦69861 who sent me.\wj*
\v 17 \x + \xo 8:17: \xt Deu 19:15.\x*\wj It's even written¦69869 in your¦69868 own laws that the testimony¦69876 of two¦69873 men¦69874 is valid.\wj*
\v 18 \wj So that's me testifying about myself¦69885, plus the father¦69894 who sent¦69892 me also testifies about me.\wj*”
\p
\v 19 “And where is your¦69902 father?” they asked.
\p \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦69903 them, “\wj You don't know either me or my father. If you did know me, then you'd also know my father.\wj*”
\p
\v 20 He explained all this while he was teaching¦69938 in the treasury¦69937 part of the temple¦69941, but no one arrested¦69944 him because¦69946 the time for his¦69951 \add suffering\add* had not yet arrived.

\rem /s1 The Unbelieving People Warned
\p
\v 21 So¦69954 he continued¦69952, “\wj I will be going away and all of you will be looking¦69962 for¦69962 me, but you'll all just die in your¦69970 sins and won't¦69976 be able to go where¦69972 I'll be going.\wj*”
\p
\v 22 This puzzled the Jewish teachers, “Surely¦69983 he's not going to commit suicide! What else could he mean about ‘you can't¦69983 go where I'm going to be going’?”
\p
\v 23 Yeshua explained, “\wj All of you¦70013 are from the world below¦70005, but I'm from the world above¦70011. You all are part of this world, but I'm not part of it.\wj*
\v 24 \wj That's why I said that you'll be dying in your sins, because¦70038 if you refuse to believe¦70040 that I am \+add God\+add*, you will indeed all be dying in your sins.\wj*”
\p
\v 25 “So¦70054 who are you?” they asked.
\p And he answered, “\wj Still just the same as I've been telling you from the beginning¦70068.\wj*
\v 26 \wj I have a lot that I need to tell you¦70079 all and to judge many of your actions, because the one who sent¦70086 me is true, and it's what I hear from him¦70096 that I speak to all people.\wj*”
\p
\v 27 (They didn't¦70104 realise that he was talking¦70111 to them about¦70107 the father¦70108 \add in heaven\add*.)
\v 28 So¦70116 \nd Yeshua\nd* told them, “\wj When you all lift up\f + \fr 8:28 \ft lifted up / exalted: There's a play on words here. See https://bibleDifferences.net/2019/04/25/156-exulted (dead link???)\f* humanity's child \+add on a pole\+add*, then you will know that I am \+add God\+add*, and that I don't do anything by myself¦70137, but I say all this just as the father¦70149 told me to.\wj*
\v 29 \wj And the one who sent¦70156 me is with me—he didn't¦70161 just leave me alone¦70164—because¦70170 I am continually doing¦70175 what pleases¦70173 him.\wj*”
\p
\v 30 After he'd said all this, many people believed¦70181 in him.

\p
\v 31 Because of this, \nd Yeshua\nd* told all the Jews who believed¦70190 in him¦70191, “\wj If you all continue to believe my message¦70199, then you're my true followers.\wj*
\v 32 \wj You will have known the truth, and¦70207 the truth will set you free.\wj*”
\p
\v 33 \x + \xo 8:33: \xt Mat 3:9; Luk 3:8.\x*But some queried, “We are Abraham's descendants and¦70225 we've never been slaves to anyone¦70227, so how can you¦70233 say that we'll be set free?”
\p
\v 34 “\wj I can assure you all that¦70250 anyone who sins is a slave¦70254 to sin,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦70239.
\v 35 “\wj And the slaves¦70260 don't¦70261 necessarily remain in the \+add family\+add* home forever—only the children have that right.\wj*
\v 36 \wj So¦70280 if the son sets you free, then you'll be truly free.\wj*
\s1 Yeshua spars with the Jewish religious leaders
\p
\v 37 “\wj Yes, I know that you're all descendants of Abraham¦70295, but you're trying to kill¦70300 me because¦70302 my message¦70304 doesn't lodge in you.\wj*
\v 38 \wj Indeed I talk about what I've actually seen with the father, but you all are doing¦70339 what you've heard¦70330 from your father.\wj*”
\rem /s1 Jesus and Abraham
\p
\v 39 But they retorted, “Abraham is our¦70347 father.”\f + \fr 8:39 \ft father meaning ancestor. (Abraham lived some 2,000 years before the time of these events.)\f*
\p And \nd Yeshua\nd* responded¦70343, “\wj Well, if you really were descendants of Abraham¦70348, you'd behave more like him¦70344.\wj*
\v 40 \wj But instead you're trying to find a way to have me killed—to kill the man¦70375 who has spoken¦70380 the truth to you—truth that I heard¦70384 from \+nd God¦70388\+nd*. Abraham¦70390 never did that.\wj*
\v 41 \wj You're doing¦70395 what \+em your¦70400\+em* father wants you all do to.\wj*”
\rem /s1 The Children of the Devil
\p But they shot back, “It's not us who was conceived by a couple that weren't even married! Anyway, we only have one father and that's \nd God¦70416\nd*.”
\p
\v 42 “\wj If God was your¦70429 father¦70427 you all would¦70432 be loving¦70431 me,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* responded¦70417, “\wj because I came¦70440 from God and for God. I didn't¦70444 just come¦70450 by myself¦70448, but God sent¦70455 me here.\wj*
\v 43 \wj Why can't you comprehend what I'm saying? The reason¦70457 that you can't stand listening to my message¦70471\wj*
\v 44 \wj is because you come from your father, the devil¦70479, and you want to do what \+em your\+em* father wants. But he was a murderer¦70490 from the beginning¦70493, and doesn't stick to the truth because there's no truth in him. Whenever¦70508 he tells lies, he's speaking from his own nature, because he's a liar and the source of lying.\wj*
\v 45 \wj But because¦70525 I'm speaking¦70528 the truth¦70527, you¦70532 don't¦70531 believe¦70532 in me.\wj*
\v 46 \wj Which¦70535 of you can scold me for my sins? If I am speaking¦70546 the truth¦70545, why don't¦70550 you believe¦70551 I'm from God?\wj*
\v 47 \wj Anyone who belongs to God, listens to what God says. But you all can't¦70566 even hear¦70562 the message¦70559, because you don't¦70566 belong to God.\wj*”

\v 48 The Jewish leaders asked, “Aren't we right¦70582 in saying¦70583 that you're¦70590 from Samaria¦70588 and that you have a demon¦70592?”
\p
\v 49 “\wj No, I don't¦70601 have a demon¦70600,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦70594, “\wj but¦70603 I honour¦70604 my¦70608 father¦70607 and¦70609 you're dishonouring¦70611 me.\wj*
\v 50 \wj But I'm not searching greatness for myself—my¦70619 father is the one searching and¦70623 the one judging¦70624.\wj*
\v 51 \wj I can assure you¦70628, that anyone¦70632 who puts my teaching into practice can be certain to avoid death¦70640 in \+add this\+add* age.\wj*”
\p
\v 52 “Now we \em know\em* that you have a demon¦70657!” the Jews said¦70649. “Abraham¦70659 and the prophets¦70663 all died¦70660, but you're¦70658 saying¦70666 that those who follow your teaching can be certain to avoid death¦70683 in \add this\add* age.
\v 53 How could you be greater¦70689 than our¦70693 ancestor Abraham¦70694 who died? Even the prophets¦70700 died. Who do you think you are?”
\p
\v 54 Again \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦70706, “\wj If I praise myself¦70713, my praise is worthless, but it's my father¦70721 who praises me—the one who you¦70727 say is your \+nd God¦70731\+nd*\wj*
\v 55 \wj although in fact you don't¦70736 even know him. But I have known him, and so I can't¦70736 say that I haven't known him or I'd be a liar like all of you. But I have known him and I am putting his¦70765 desires into practice.\wj*
\v 56 \wj Your¦70770 ancestor Abraham would have been excited to see me here—in fact he did see ahead and was very happy about it.\wj*”
\p
\v 57 Because of that, the Jewish leaders asked, “You aren't¦70792 even fifty¦70789 years old yet. How could you have seen¦70796 Abraham?”\f + \fr 8:57 \ft Abraham lived some 2,000 years before Yeshua.\f*
\p
\v 58 \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj I can assure you¦70807 that \+em I am\+em*\f + \fr 8:58 \ft This awkward English is necessary to catch the play on words, because ‘I am’ is the meaning of God's name \+em Yahweh\+em*.\f* before¦70808 Abraham¦70809 ever existed.\wj*”
\p
\v 59 When they heard that, they picked up rocks¦70816 to throw¦70818 at Yeshua \add to kill him¦70820\add*. But Yeshua became hidden¦70823 from their sight, and went¦70825 on out of the temple¦70828.

\rem /s1 A Man Born Blind Receives Sight
\p
\v 1 As Yeshua was walking along, he¦70840 saw¦70840 a man¦70841 who had been blind¦70842 from birth¦70844
\v 2 and¦70846 his followers asked¦70847 him, “Honoured teacher, why was this man¦70856 born blind¦70863? Was it because he himself sinned¦70855, or his parents¦70860?”
\p
\v 3 \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦70866, “\wj It wasn't either this man¦70870 or his¦70875 parents¦70874 that sinned¦70871.\f + \fr 9:3 \ft We just want to alert our readers here that we have divided the Greek sentences here in a way that's different from the long-standing tradition. (The Greek originals have no punctuation, so either way is valid.)\f* But so that \+nd God¦70882\+nd* can work in him for others to see,\wj*
\v 4 \wj as long as it's daytime, we need to do what the one who sent¦70894 us wants, but when nighttime¦70902 comes, no one will be able to work.\wj*
\v 5 \x + \xo 9:5: \xt Mat 5:14; Yhn 8:12.\x*\wj As long as I'm here in this world, I am the light¦70914 of the world.\wj*”
\p
\v 6 After he'd said¦70919 this, Yeshua spat on the ground¦70921 and after mixing some clay into a slurry, he spread¦70929 it on the eyes¦70938 of the man
\v 7 and told him¦70944 to go and wash in the Siloam Pool.\f + \fr 9:7 \ft Siloam means ‘to be sent out’.\f*
\p
\v 8 Then the neighbours¦70967 of the man and others who had seen him earlier¦70974, knowing that he was a beggar¦70976 asked, “Isn't he the one who always sat and begged here?”
\p
\v 9 And indeed, some were saying, “Yes, this is him.” But others¦70992 were saying, “No, but he looks quite similar¦70999.”
\p And the man said, “I \em am\em* him.”
\p
\v 10 So¦71010 they¦71008 asked him¦71013, “Well, how come that now you¦71018 can see?”
\p
\v 11 “A man named \nd Yeshua\nd* made a slurry,” he said, “and spread¦71033 it on my eyes and told me to go and wash at Siloam¦71047 Pool. So I went and did it, and when I washed¦71056 my eyes, I could see.”
\p
\v 12 “Where¦71066 is he now?” they¦71063 asked.
\rem /s1 The Pharisees Investigate the Healing
\p “I don't¦71071 know,” said¦71063 the man.
\s1 The Pharisees can't accept the healing of the blind man
\p
\v 13 Then they brought the man¦71081 who had been blind¦71081 to the Pharisees.
\v 14 Now, it¦71082 had been the Rest Day when \nd Yeshua\nd* had made the slurry and¦71095 enabled him¦71097 to see,
\v 15 and because of this, some in the Pharisee party¦71107 asked him how it was that now he could see. And he answered, “Well, he put a slurry on my¦71118 eyes¦71122 and when I washed¦71125 them, I could see.”
\p
\v 16 “Well clearly that man is not from \nd God¦71142\nd*,” some of them said, “because¦71145 he doesn't respect the Rest Day.”
\p However others said, “But¦71161 if he's just a sinner, how could he do miracles like that?”
\p
\v 17 So¦71188 they asked the man who had been blind¦71171, “Well, what do \em you\em* have to say because¦71182 it was your¦71184 eyes¦71186 that he opened¦71183?”
\p “He must be a prophet¦71191,” the man said.
\p
\v 18 But some of the Jews weren't even sure that¦71207 he really had been blind¦71203 before and could now see, so they called¦71209 for his¦71214 parents¦71213
\v 19 and asked¦71219 them, “You two say that this is your¦71229 son and that he was born blind¦71234. If so, how come that now he can see?”
\p
\v 20 His¦71249 parents¦71248 answered¦71243, “We know that he's our¦71258 son, and we know that he was born blind¦71261.
\v 21 But as for how come he can now see, we don't¦71268 know that. Nor do we know who healed his¦71273 eyes¦71276. But ask¦71287 him—he's old enough to speak¦71292 for himself¦71291.”
\v 22 (His¦71297 parents said these¦71293 things because they were afraid of the Jewish religious leaders, because the leaders had already¦71302 announced that anyone¦71311 who said that Yeshua was the \nd messiah¦71315\nd* would get banned from all religious ceremonies,
\v 23 so that's why they had said¦71324, “He's old enough—just ask¦71330 him.”)
\p
\v 24 So¦71334 the leaders summoned the man born blind¦71344 a second¦71339 time and commanded him, “Only praise \nd God¦71351\nd* himself for this, because we know that that man is a sinner¦71360.”
\p
\v 25 “Well, I don't¦71370 know whether or not he's a sinner¦71368,” replied the man. “All I know is that I used to be blind¦71376 but now I can see.”
\p
\v 26 “What did he do to you?” they asked again. “How did he open your¦71394 eyes¦71396?”
\p
\v 27 And he answered¦71401, “I already¦71405 told you that, and you didn't¦71407 even listen. Why do you want to hear¦71414 it all over again¦71411? Do you guys all want to become¦71423 his¦71420 followers as well?”
\p
\v 28 Then¦71425 they¦71427 insulted¦71427 him¦71429 and¦71430 said¦71431, “\em You\em* might be a follower of that man, but¦71440 \em we¦71438\em* are followers of Mosheh.
\v 29 We know that \nd God¦71453\nd* spoke¦71450 to Mosheh, but¦71461 we¦71463 don't¦71462 even know where¦71464 this other fellow is from.”
\p
\v 30 “Wow, that's pretty amazing,” the man responded¦71471. “That man opened¦71490 up my¦71491 eyes¦71493, and you teachers don't¦71485 even know where¦71487 he's from!
\v 31 We know that \nd God¦71499\nd* doesn't listen to sinners¦71497, but he listens to those who worship him and do what he wants.
\v 32 In all the centuries past we never heard¦71520 that a person could give sight to someone who was born blind¦71526.
\v 33 If this man¦71532 isn't¦71538 from \nd God¦71534\nd*, surely he¦71539 wouldn't be able to do that!”
\p
\v 34 They reacted, “You're just an ignorant sinner, and¦71560 you think you can teach¦71558 \em us\em*!” Then¦71560 they had him thrown¦71561 out of the room.

\v 35 \nd Yeshua\nd* heard¦71565 that they had thrown¦71570 out the man who could now see, and when he found¦71574 him, he said¦71578, “\wj Do you believe¦71581 that humanity's child \+add came from God\+add*?\wj*”

\p
\v 19 The Jewish religious leaders were again¦72117 divided about Yeshua's teaching

\p
\v 21 But others were saying¦72144, “He doesn't sound like he's demon-possessed. And how could a demon make a blind¦72158 man see?”

\p
\v 22 By then it was winter¦72173 and the time for the Jewish Festival of Dedication in Yerushalem.
\v 23 \nd Yeshua\nd* was walking¦72177 in the temple¦72183 in an area known as Solomon's¦72188 Porch
\v 24 when he was surrounded¦72189 by the Jewish religious leaders and interrogated, “How long do you plan to keep us in suspense¦72203 for? If you are the \nd messiah¦72208\nd*, just tell us clearly.”
\p
\v 25 “\wj I already told you all,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦72213, “\wj but you didn't¦72221 believe¦72222 me. The miracles that I do with the authority of my¦72236 father¦72235 testify¦72241 about me,\wj*
\v 26 \wj but you don't¦72247 accept what the miracles point to because¦72249 you aren't¦72247 part of my flock.\wj*
\v 27 \wj My¦72268 sheep¦72263 listen to my¦72268 voice¦72267, and I know them and they¦72276 follow¦72276 after¦72277 me.\wj*

\v 29 \wj My¦72306 father is the one who gave¦72310 them to me, and he's more powerful than any other, so no one can snatch¦72323 them away from him.\wj*
\v 30 \wj The father¦72333 and¦72331 I are one.\wj*”
\p
\v 31 Again the Jewish leaders picked up rocks¦72340 to throw at him to kill him
\v 32 but \nd Yeshua\nd* asked them, “\wj I showed¦72355 you all many miracles from my¦72362 father¦72361. Which miracle do you want to kill me for?\wj*”
\p
\v 33 \x + \xo 10:33: \xt Lev 24:16.\x*They answered¦72372, “It's not for any \em good¦72379\em* deed that we think you deserve to die, but because¦72388 you, a human¦72390, dishonour \nd God¦72395\nd* by claiming to be him¦72374.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 10:34: \xt Psa 82:6.\x*\nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦72396, “\wj Isn't it¦72404 written¦72405 in your¦72413 scriptures that God said¦72416, ‘You all are gods¦72417’?\wj*
\v 35 \wj Now the scriptures¦72436 can't¦72432 be wrong, and¦72431 if the ones who heard teaching from \+nd God¦72429\+nd* were called¦72421 gods¦72422,\wj*
\v 36 \wj why are you¦72446 telling the one that the father¦72439 blessed and¦72441 sent¦72442 out into the world¦72445 that I am insulting¦72449 God because¦72450 I said¦72451 that I'm God's son?\wj*
\v 37 \wj If I'm not doing¦72460 my¦72465 father's¦72464 work, then you don't¦72459 need to believe¦72467 that he sent me,\wj*
\v 38 \wj but if I am doing¦72471 his work, even if you don't¦72474 believe that he sent me, at least believe in what I do so that you all can know that the father is in me and I'm in the father.\wj*”
\p
\v 39 That was enough that they tried yet again¦72509 to arrest¦72510 him, but he was able to get out and away from their¦72516 influence.
\p
\v 40 \x + \xo 10:40: \xt Yhn 1:28.\x*Then¦72517 Yeshua crossed the Yordan¦72523 river to the place¦72526 where¦72528 Yohan had immersed¦72534 the people, and¦72517 he stayed there¦72538.
\v 41 Many people visited him there, and¦72539 they were saying¦72545 that even though Yohan had never done even one miracle, on the other¦72556 hand everything that he had said about Yeshua was true,
\v 42 and¦72565 many people there¦72573 believed¦72569 that Yeshua was from God.

\s1 Yeshua is aware of Lazarus' death from afar
\rem /s1 The Death of Lazarus
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 11:1: \xt Luk 10:38-39.\x*Now there was a man¦72576 called Lazarus¦72579 who lived in the village¦72584 of Bethany¦72581 along with his sisters¦72592 Martha¦72589 and¦72587 Maria¦72586.
\v 2 \x + \xo 11:2: \xt Yhn 12:3.\x*(Maria¦72599 was the one who \jmp later|link-href="#C12V3"\jmp* poured fragrant oil over Yeshua¦72618 and¦72596 wiped¦72606 his¦72609 feet¦72608 with her¦72612 hair¦72611.) But¦72596 now their brother¦72616 was seriously ill
\v 3 and so the two sisters¦72627 sent¦72621 a message to Yeshua saying¦72634, “\nd Master¦72636\nd*, this man that you¦72639 love is seriously ill.”
\p
\v 4 However, when \nd Yeshua\nd* got the message he said¦72651 \add to those around him\add*, “\wj This sickness¦72654 won't¦72656 end in death¦72659 but¦72648 in honour for \+nd God¦72665\+nd*, so that his son will also be honoured because of it.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 Now it was true that \nd Yeshua\nd* loved the three of them.
\v 6 Yet when he heard¦72696 that¦72706 Lazarus was sick, he stayed in the place¦72709 where he was for two¦72710 more days¦72711
\v 7 before he said to his followers, “\wj It's time to head down to Yudea¦72724 again.\wj*”
\p
\v 8 But they double-checked, “Honoured teacher, the Yudeans wanted to execute you, so do you really want to go back there¦72742 again¦72740?”
\p
\v 9 And \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦72743, “\wj There are twelve hours¦72749 of light in the day. Anyone who walks during the daytime doesn't stumble¦72765 because¦72766 he is seeing¦72773 the light \+add that shines in\+add* this world¦72770.\wj*
\v 10 \wj But anyone¦72776 who walks at night¦72780 will stumble¦72781, because¦72782 the light¦72784 is not in them.\wj*”
\v 11 And he continued¦72791, “\wj Our¦72801 friend¦72800 Lazarus¦72797 has fallen¦72802 asleep¦72802, but I'm going¦72805 so that I can wake him up.\wj*”
\p
\v 12 But his followers objected, “\nd Master¦72818\nd*, \add it's good\add* if he's sleeping because it helps with healing.”
\p
\v 13 But \nd Yeshua\nd* had spoken¦72824 about Lazarus' death¦72831—not just normal sleep as they had thought.
\v 14 So¦72845 \nd Yeshua¦72850\nd* told them plainly¦72851, “\wj Lazarus¦72852 is dead\wj*
\v 15 \wj and I'm glad that I wasn't there¦72866, because¦72859 you all will benefit as your¦72859 faith grows. Anyway, let's get moving.\wj*”
\p
\v 16 Thomas¦72873 (nicknamed ‘Twin’) grumbled to the others, “Yeah, we might as well go so that¦72874 we can get killed as well.”

\p
\v 17 So¦72889 when they eventually arrived, \nd Lazarus¦72891\nd* body had already¦72900 been in the burial chamber for four¦72899 days¦72901.
\v 18 The village of Bethany¦72911 was less than three kilometres from Yerushalem,
\v 19 so many of the Yudeans from there had come¦72927 out to console¦72937 Martha¦72932 and¦72933 Maria¦72935 after the death of their¦72940 brother¦72941.
\p
\v 20 As soon as Martha¦72945 heard¦72947 that \nd Yeshua\nd* had arrived, she went out to meet him, but¦72955 Maria¦72954 stayed behind where she was sitting¦72961 in the house¦72958.
\v 21 Martha¦72966 cried, “\nd Yeshua\nd*, \nd master¦72971\nd*. If you'd been here, my¦72981 brother¦72980 wouldn't¦72977 have died¦72978,
\v 22 because I already know that anything that you ask from \nd God¦72998\nd*, he will give it to you.”
\p
\v 23 \nd Yeshua\nd* responded, “\wj Your¦73011 brother¦73010 will come back to life.\wj*”
\p
\v 24 “Yes, I know that he'll come back to life at the resurrection¦73022 on the last day¦73026,” said Martha¦73015.
\p
\v 25 But \nd Yeshua\nd* continued¦73027, “\wj \+em I am\+em* the resurrection¦73036 and¦73037 the life¦73039. Anyone who believes¦73041 that I'm from God, even if they die¦73045 they'll still be living¦73046,\wj*
\v 26 \wj and everyone¦73049 who's alive and believes that¦73050 I was sent from God, will not die¦73058 in the \+add next\+add* age.\wj*”
\p
\v 27 Martha replied, “Yes, \nd master¦73069\nd*, I do believe¦73072 that you're¦73075 the \nd messiah¦73078\nd*, God's son, the one sent into this world¦73086.”
\s1 Yeshua weeps with his close friends
\rem /s1 Jesus Weeps
\p
\v 28 After saying this, Martha went¦73093 and quietly called¦73095 her¦73099 sister¦73098 Maria¦73096, “The teacher¦73106 is on his way and he wants to see you.”
\v 29 So¦73113 Maria quickly¦73118 got up and¦73119 went to find him¦73123.
\v 30 At that stage, \nd Yeshua\nd* hadn't yet come¦73128 into the village¦73134 proper, but¦73135 was still¦73137 at the edge where¦73142 Martha¦73146 had met him¦73144.
\v 31 The Yudean people who'd been sitting with Maria¦73162 in sympathy there in the house¦73156, when they saw her get up quickly¦73165 and go out, they assumed that¦73150 she was going¦73178 to the cemetery to weep there.
\p
\v 32 But when Maria¦73188 found \nd Yeshua\nd*, she¦73190 knelt at his¦73201 feet¦73205 and said, “\nd Master¦73209\nd*, if you'd been here my¦73217 brother¦73220 wouldn't have died¦73218.”
\p
\v 33 Now when \nd Yeshua\nd* saw¦73225 her weeping there, along with the others that had followed also weeping, he himself¦73250 was quite affected and groaned¦73242 inside,
\v 34 but he just asked, “\wj Where¦73253 has he been laid?\wj*”
\p “\nd Master¦73259\nd*, come and¦73251 see¦73262,” they replied.
\p
\v 35 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* \add broke down and\add* burst into tears,
\v 36 which made the others comment, “See¦73271 how much he cared about him.”
\p
\v 37 But some of them mocked, “This is the man who could make a blind¦73291 man see again, yet how come he wasn't able to stop this man from dying!”

\p
\v 38 So¦73312 \nd Yeshua\nd* who was still holding back sobs, went to the cemetery. Lazarus' body had been placed in a cave with a stone¦73315 blocking it,
\v 39 and \nd Yeshua\nd* instructed them to take away the stone¦73324.
\p Martha¦73334 (the sister¦73330 of the dead man) spoke up, “\nd Master¦73335\nd*, the stink¦73337 will be bad because¦73339 it's already¦73336 been four days.”
\p
\v 40 But \nd Yeshua\nd* responded¦73346, “\wj Didn't I tell you that if you would believe¦73350, then you would see God's power?\wj*”
\v 41 So¦73369 they took¦73357 the stone¦73361 away and \nd Yeshua\nd* looked upwards¦73375 and said¦73377, “Father, I thank¦73379 you that you listen to me.
\v 42 Actually I know that you always¦73388 hear¦73390 me, but I said¦73397 that for the sake of these people so that they will believe¦73399 that it¦73397 was you who sent¦73403 me here.”
\v 43 After saying that, he¦73409 shouted, “\wj Lazarus¦73412, come¦73413 out!\wj*”
\v 44 Then the man who had died¦73419 \add slowly\add* shuffled out—still with linen¦73430 strips¦73430 wrapped around his hands¦73428 and his feet¦73423, and a cloth wrapped around his face¦73433.

\p
\v 45 Because of that, many of the Yudeans believed¦73472 that Yeshua was from God after having followed Maria¦73462 and¦73463 seeing what Yeshua did.
\v 46 But others went¦73479 and¦73483 told the Pharisee party¦73482 what \nd Yeshua\nd* had done.
\v 47 So¦73494 the chief¦73496 priests¦73496 and the Pharisee party¦73499 called a formal meeting and asked, “What should we¦73504 do because¦73506 this man¦73509 is doing many miracles.
\v 48 If we allow¦73517 him to continue like this, all the crowds will be believing¦73521 he's the messiah, and then the Romans will come and destroy both our temple and our governance.”
\p
\v 49 But one of them, Caiaphas¦73548 who was chief¦73549 priest¦73549 that year¦73552, spoke up, “You don't¦73557 know anything.
\v 50 Don't you all realise that its better for all of us if one man¦73569 dies so that the people¦73573 and the nation¦73578 won't¦73575 be destroyed?”
\v 51 (He didn't¦73584 say this from his own thinking, but being¦73589 chief¦73588 priest¦73588 that year¦73591, he was announcing God's message that \nd Yeshua\nd* was going¦73596 to die for the nation¦73603,
\v 52 and¦73604 not only for this nation¦73608, but¦73610 for all of God's children¦73614 scattered¦73619 around the world to become united.)
\p
\v 53 As a result, from that day¦73629 on they decided that Yeshua needed to be executed.
\v 54 Because of that, \nd Yeshua\nd* no longer¦73640 walked around Yudea in public¦73641, but¦73646 went¦73647 out to the town of Ephraim¦73657 out in the wilderness¦73655 and¦73660 stayed there¦73637 with his followers.
\rem /s1 The Passover in Jerusalem

\v 55 At that time, the Jewish Passover celebrations were approaching, and¦73678 many people from the regions¦73687 went¦73679 to Yerushalem ahead of the celebrations to purify¦73695 themselves¦73696.
\v 56 They were looking¦73697 out for \nd Yeshua\nd* and as they stood¦73709 around in the temple¦73708, they asked each other, “What do you think? Surely he won't¦73716 come¦73717 to the celebrations.”
\v 57 The chief¦73725 priests¦73725 and¦73722 the Pharisee party¦73728 had already announced that if anyone¦73735 knew where¦73737 Yeshua was, they must inform them so that they could arrest¦73742 him¦73743.

\v 1 Because of this, \nd Yeshua\nd* went¦73753 to Bethany¦73755 six days¦73750 before¦73747 the Passover. This was where¦73756 Lazarus¦73758 lived, the one he had brought back to life.
\v 2 So¦73771 they prepared dinner for him there¦73774 and Martha¦73777 was serving¦73778 and Lazarus¦73783 was among those sitting¦73788 with Yeshua.
\v 3 \x + \xo 12:3: \xt Luk 7:37-38.\x*Then Maria¦73794 took about 300g of very expensive nard oil and smeared it on \nd Yeshua's\nd* feet, and then wiped¦73810 off his¦73816 feet with her¦73813 own hair¦73812, and the house¦73820 was filled¦73821 with the fragrance of the oil.
\v 4 But Yudas¦73832, one of Yeshua's apprentices¦73838 (the one who would eventually turn him in) complained,
\v 5 “How come this lotion wasn't sold for almost a year's wages and¦73862 then the money given¦73863 to the poor?”
\v 6 But he didn't¦73871 say this because he cared for poor people, but¦73868 because he carried the purse for the group and used to steal from it.

\v 16 (\nd Yeshua's\nd* apprentices didn't¦74060 realise all these things at the time, but it was later after Yeshua was lifted up to heaven that they were reminded¦74075 that these things had been written¦74086 about him, and that they had \add indeed\add* happened to him.)
\p
\v 17 People in the crowd¦74094 were telling each other about how they'd been with Yeshua when he'd called¦74103 Lazarus¦74102 out from the burial chamber and brought him back to life,

\v 27 \wj Now, I'm very troubled. What else could I say¦74315 other than, ‘Father, let me avoid what's coming’? But it was exactly this that I came¦74326 for.\wj*
\v 28 \wj Father, may your¦74335 authority be honoured.\wj*”
\p And a voice¦74354 from the sky answered, “I've already brought honour¦74333 to it and will do so again¦74362.”
\p
\v 29 This caused some in the crowd¦74367 standing there to say that they'd heard¦74371 thunder¦74375 while others said that a messenger¦74384 must have spoken¦74386 to Yeshua.
\p
\v 30 “\wj That voice¦74399 wasn't for my¦74395 sake,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* responded¦74392, “\wj but¦74403 for all of you¦74405.\wj*
\v 31 \wj This world is about to be judged¦74407 and its ruler¦74414 will be thrown¦74419 out,\wj*
\v 32 \wj and¦74422 when I'm lifted up\f + \fr 12:32 \ft lifted up / exalted: See https://bibleDifferences.net/2019/04/25/156-exulted\f* from the earth¦74431, I will attract everyone towards me.\wj*”
\v 33 By saying¦74441 this, he was indicating how he was going¦74445 to die.
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 12:34: \xt Psa 110:4; Isa 9:7; Eze 37:25; Dan 7:14.\x*So¦74448 the crowd¦74451 queried him¦74449, “We heard¦74453 from the scriptures that the \nd messiah¦74459\nd* will stay until the end of the age so why do you¦74468 say that humanity's child will be lifted up? And who is this ‘humanity's child’?”
\p
\v 35 \nd Yeshua\nd* answered them, “\wj The light will be among you all for just a little¦74490 bit longer, so get walking while¦74501 you have the light so that you won't¦74507 have to deal with darkness. Anyone walking in the dark doesn't know where¦74522 they're going¦74523.\wj*
\v 36 \wj While¦74524 you still have the light, believe¦74529 in the light so that you will become¦74537 children of light.\wj*”
\rem /s1 The Jews Continue in Their Unbelief

\p \nd Yeshua¦74541\nd* said these¦74538 things and then after leaving them, he was hidden¦74546 from them.
\s1 Many people refuse to stand for Yeshua
\p
\v 37 Even though Yeshua had done so many miracles in front of the people, they¦74558 didn't¦74557 believe¦74558 that he was the messiah.
\v 38 \x + \xo 12:38: \xt Isa 53:1 (LXX).\x*This fulfilled¦74568 what the prophet¦74567 Isayah wrote,
\q1 “\nd Yahweh¦74571\nd*, who believed¦74573 our¦74576 report¦74575?
\q1 And who was \nd Yahweh's\nd* power revealed¦74582 to?”
\p
\v 39 Because¦74583 of this, they¦74586 weren't able to believe¦74587, and again as Isayah¦74593 wrote,
\q1
\v 40 \x + \xo 12:40: \xt Isa 6:10 (LXX).\x*“He has blinded¦74594 their eyes and maimed¦74600 their emotions,
\q1 so that they can't¦74606 see with their eyes and understand¦74612 with their minds,
\q2 or they might be turned¦74618 and then I would heal them.”
\p
\v 41 Isayah wrote this because¦74629 he saw¦74632 the messiah's greatness and spoke¦74639 concerning¦74640 him.
\v 42 Likewise¦74642, many of the Jewish leaders believed¦74650 that Yeshua was the messiah, but they didn't tell others because¦74654 they didn't want the Pharisee party¦74656 to banish them from their services
\v 43 as they¦74664 valued the praise of people more than praise from \nd God¦74676\nd*.
\s1 It's Yeshua's teachings that will judge the hearers

\rem /s1 Summary of Jesus' Teaching
\p
\v 44 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* called out, “\wj Anyone who believes that I came from God is not \+add just\+add* believing in me, but \+add also\+add* believing in the one who sent me,\wj*
\v 45 \wj and¦74701 anyone who watches me \+add working\+add*, is watching the one who sent¦74708 me.\wj*
\v 46 \wj I came into this world¦74714 as light¦74711 so that¦74718 anyone who believes¦74719 in me won't¦74725 have darkness¦74724 residing in them.\wj*
\v 47 \wj I won't¦74738 be judging¦74744 anyone¦74730 who hears my¦74731 teaching and¦74737 doesn't obey it, because¦74747 I didn't¦74738 come to judge¦74750 the world but¦74753 rather to save¦74755 it.\wj*
\v 48 \wj Anyone who rejects¦74759 me and¦74761 doesn't accept my¦74766 teaching does have a judge though—it's the message¦74772 that I spoke¦74774 that will judge them at the end of time\wj*
\v 49 \wj because I wasn't speaking¦74805 from my own thoughts, but it was the father¦74794 himself¦74795 who sent¦74792 me that told me what to say¦74802 and what to teach.\wj*
\v 50 \wj And I'm fully aware that \+add obeying\+add* his¦74811 commands¦74810 leads to living forever. Therefore¦74818 whenever I speak, I just say whatever the father¦74826 said¦74823 to me.\wj*”

\p
\v 1 Even before¦74829 the actual feast part of the Passover celebrations, \nd Yeshua\nd* knew that his time had come—the time when he would leave this world and¦74830 \add return\add* to the father¦74855. He loved his followers who were in the world right through to the end¦74865.
\p
\v 2 And now it was getting near time for the dinner and¦74868 the devil¦74874 had already¦74875 put into Yudas¦74883 Iscariot's mind¦74879 \add the idea\add* of handing Yeshua over \add to the authorities\add*.
\v 3 Yeshua knew that the father¦74903 had given¦74899 everything to him, putting it under his control, and he knew that he had come from God and would return to God.
\v 4 So he got up from the dinner \add table\add*, changed out of his clothes¦74927, and wrapped a linen¦74931 towel¦74931 around himself¦74934.
\v 5 Then he put water¦74938 into the wash bowl and started washing¦74947 the feet¦74949 of his apprentices¦74951, wiping¦74954 them dry with the linen¦74956 towel¦74956 that¦74957 he was wearing wrapped around him.
\v 6 After he'd washed a few, he got to Simon¦74964 Peter¦74965 who asked him, “\nd Master¦74971\nd*, are you going to wash my¦74973 feet¦74976?”
\p
\v 7 “\wj What I'm doing¦74985 now,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦74977, “\wj you won't¦74988 really understand, but in the future you will.\wj*”
\p
\v 8 Peter responded, “Well I'm never ever going to let you wash \em my\em* feet¦75010!”
\p “\wj If I don't¦75004 wash them,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦75015, “\wj then you won't¦75004 be included in my \+add group\+add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 9 “Well, if that's so,” Peter¦75032 said, “don't¦75035 just wash my feet¦75038 but¦75041 my hands¦75044 and¦75045 my head as well.”
\p
\v 10 \nd Yeshua\nd* responded, “\wj Any person who's already washed¦75053 \+add themselves\+add* only needs to wash their feet¦75065 now to be clean. And so you're clean, but not every one of you.\wj*”
\v 11 He said¦75089 this last bit because¦75087 he already knew who was going to hand him over.
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 13:12-15: \xt Luk 22:27.\x*So¦75096 when he'd finished washing their¦75100 feet¦75099, he got dressed again¦75111 and sat¦75110 down and asked, “\wj Do you know what I just did to you all?\wj*
\v 13 \wj You call me teacher and \+nd master¦75125\+nd*, and so you¦75128 should, because¦75131 I am.\wj*
\v 14 \wj So¦75145 if the \+nd master¦75153\+nd* and teacher of you all washed¦75147 your¦75148 feet, then you also ought¦75162 to wash each other's feet.\wj*

\p
\v 21 After saying¦75294 these¦75280 things, \nd Yeshua's\nd* thoughts were troubled and he said, “\wj I can assure you that one of you will be turning me in.\wj*”
\p
\v 22 This made his apprentices¦75312 glance around at each other, puzzled about which one he was talking¦75318 about.
\v 23 \nd One\nd* of them that \nd Yeshua\nd* especially liked,\f + \fr 13:23 \ft This apprentice, unnamed here, is assumed to be the author of this account (being shy or modest).\f* was leaning against him¦75326 \add at the table\add*.
\v 24 So¦75339 Simon¦75341 Peter¦75342 nodded to him to find out who Yeshua had been talking¦75360 about¦75358,
\v 25 and he leaned¦75363 back on \nd Yeshua\nd* and asked \add quietly\add*, “\nd Master¦75375\nd*, who is it?”
\p
\v 26 “\wj It's the one I hand this piece of bread to after I've dipped it \+add in the sauce\+add*,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦75378. Then¦75397 after dipping his piece of bread in, he gave it to Yudas¦75408 Iscariot¦75412.
\v 27 After \add Yudas accepted\add* the piece¦75416 of bread¦75416, Satan¦75422 entered into him, and¦75413 then¦75413 \nd Yeshua\nd* told him, “What you're¦75430 about to do, do it soon.”
\v 28 But¦75435 none of the others sitting¦75439 around the table knew¦75437 what Yeshua meant.
\v 29 Some of them thought that since Yudas¦75455 held their purse, perhaps \nd Yeshua\nd* was getting him¦75458 to buy something they needed for the feast¦75469 or to give¦75475 something to the poor.
\p
\v 30 Anyway, having¦75476 eaten the piece¦75479 of bread¦75479, Yudas went¦75482 straight outside where it¦75484 was already dark.

\p
\v 28 Then¦78920 they led \nd Yeshua\nd* out from Caiaphas' place and towards the residence of the governor. It was now the early¦78919 hours of the morning and as Jews, they didn't¦78922 enter the residence of the Roman governor so they wouldn't become defiled¦78929 and thus unable to eat¦78932 the Passover meal.
\v 29 So¦78936 Governor Pilate¦78940 came¦78935 outside¦78941 to them and¦78945 asked, “What charge are you¦78950 all bringing¦78950 against¦78951 this man¦78953?”
\p
\v 30 “We wouldn't¦78969 have brought him to you if he hadn't committed a serious crime,” they answered¦78955.
\p
\v 31 So¦78976 Pilate¦78979 said, “You just take him and judge¦78989 him yourselves according¦78985 to your¦78988 own laws.”
\p But the Jewish leaders responded¦78975, “We don't¦78998 have permission¦78999 to execute anyone¦79001.”
\v 32 (This happened to fulfil¦79009 what \nd Yeshua\nd* had said\x + \xo 18:32: \xt Yhn 3:14; 12:32.\x* about the way that he was going¦79017 to die.)
\p
\v 33 So Pilate¦79027 went¦79019 back into his governor's¦79024 residence¦79024 and called¦79029 for \nd Yeshua\nd* and asked him¦79034, “So you're the king¦79039 of the Jews?”
\p
\v 34 “\wj Are you saying¦79053 this yourself¦79049,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* asked, “\wj or did others¦79056 say it¦79058 about me?\wj*”
\p
\v 35 Pilate¦79065 retorted, “Hoy! I'm not a Jew. It was your own people and the chief¦79079 priests¦79079 that handed you over to me. What have you done?”
\p
\v 36 “\wj My kingdom isn't in this world,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦79086, “\wj because if it was, my supporters would have fought so that I wouldn't have been handed over to the Jewish leaders. But no, my kingdom isn't from here.\wj*”
\p
\v 37 “So¦79137 you \em are\em* a king then?” Pilate¦79140 responded¦79136.
\p “\wj You're saying¦79152 that I'm a king,\wj*” said \nd Yeshua\nd*, “\wj and indeed I was born to be a king. I came into the world¦79169 so that I could testify¦79171 to the truth.\wj*”
\p
\v 38 “\add Yeah.\add* What is truth¦79196?” said Pilate¦79192.

\p After he'd said this, Pilate went¦79201 back outside to the Jews and¦79197 told them, “I can't¦79209 find anything that he's guilty of.
\v 39 But you all have a custom¦79218 here that the governor can release one prisoner during the Passover. So would you like me to release the king¦79236 of the Jews?”
\p
\v 40 But¦79250 they¦79239 all yelled¦79239 back, “No, not this one. Release Barabbas.” (Barabbas was a robber¦79253.)

\p
\v 1 So¦79255 Pilate¦79259 took¦79256 \nd Yeshua¦79262\nd* and¦79263 had him flogged¦79264.
\v 2 Then¦79265 the soldiers¦79267 twisted¦79268 some thorn¦79271 branches together¦79268 into a crown¦79269 and put it¦79273 on Yeshua's head, and they dressed him in a \add royal\add* purple¦79283 robe¦79282.
\v 3 They came up to him and said, “Greetings¦79292, you king¦79294 of the Jews,” and then¦79297 slapped him.
\p
\v 4 Then¦79301 Pilate¦79307 went¦79302 back outside¦79305 and¦79301 said to the Jews, “Look¦79312 here. I'm bringing¦79313 him out to you so that you all can know¦79318 that I didn't¦79329 find him guilty¦79326 of anything.”
\v 5 So¦79348 they led \nd Yeshua\nd* out wearing¦79339 the thorny¦79342 crown¦79343 and the kingly robe¦79347, and Pilate said, “Look¦79351. Here's the man¦79354.”
\p
\v 6 Now when the chief¦79360 priests¦79360 and their supporters saw¦79357 him, they yelled¦79365 out, “Execute him on a stake! Execute him on a stake!”
\p “Well you take him and execute¦79380 him on a stake,” Pilate¦79374 answered, “because¦79382 I haven't found anything that he's guilty¦79388 of.”
\p
\v 7 The Jews responded, “We have a law and he should be executed according¦79397 to that law because¦79403 he said he was the son of \nd God¦79407\nd*.”
\p
\v 8 Now when Pilate¦79415 heard¦79413 that, he became more afraid¦79421.
\v 9 So¦79422 he went¦79423 back inside the residence¦79426 and¦79422 asked Yeshua, “Where do you come from?”
\p But¦79422 Yeshua didn't¦79441 answer¦79440 him.
\v 10 So¦79445 Pilate¦79448 said, “Why don't¦79450 you answer me? Don't you realise that I have the authority to release you and I also have the authority to have you executed¦79463 on a stake¦79463?”
\p
\v 11 “\wj You have no authority¦79474 over me,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered¦79467, “\wj none at all, except¦79479 what has been granted to you from above¦79485. Because¦79486 of this, the sin¦79494 of the person who handed me over to you is greater¦79493.\wj*”
\p
\v 12 After hearing this, Pilate¦79500 wanted to release him but¦79506 the Jews yelled¦79508 out, “If you release that¦79523 man, you're¦79518 no friend of Caesar. Everyone¦79522 who claims to be a king is no friend of Caesar's.”
\p
\v 13 So¦79533 now Pilate, having¦79535 heard¦79535 all this, brought¦79542 \nd Yeshua\nd* outside¦79543 \add again\add*. Pilate sat¦79548 down on the judge's seat at a place¦79553 called The Stone¦79555 Pavement¦79555 (and¦79547 called Gabbatha¦79560 in Hebrew).
\v 14 It was now about¦79570 noon on the day¦79564 when the Passover meal is prepared¦79564, and¦79563 Pilate said to the Jews, “Look¦79578. Here's your¦79581 king¦79580.”
\p
\v 15 They yelled¦79585 back, “Take him away. Take him away. Execute¦79590 him on a stake.”
\p Pilate¦79595 asked them, “You want me to have your¦79598 king executed¦79599 on a stake?”
\p “We don't¦79603 have any king other than Caesar¦79608,” the chief priests¦79602 answered¦79600.
\p
\v 16 So¦79621 Pilate gave¦79611 them his permission and handed \nd Yeshua\nd* over to them, and they took¦79619 him away to be executed¦79616 on a stake¦79616.

\v 17 Carrying the pole\f + \fr 19:17 \ft TD: The Greek word used here is used in other places to mean a stake such as used to make a fence. It's uncertain whether or not it had a horizontal cross-piece, although the Romans did use a range of methods.\f* himself¦79634, Yeshua arrived at the Place of the Skull (called Golgotha¦79650 in Hebrew) just out of the city
\v 18 where¦79651 they secured him to a stake along with two¦79658 others¦79657—one stake on each side and with \nd Yeshua¦79666\nd* on the middle¦79663 one.
\v 19 Pilate¦79672 wrote¦79667 out a title¦79670 and¦79673 put it¦79679 on the stake¦79678: \nd Yeshua\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦79684\nd*, the king¦79686 of the Jews.
\v 20 Many Jews read this title¦79693 because¦79699 the place¦79703 where¦79708 \nd Yeshua\nd* was executed¦79709 was near the city¦79705, and it¦79713 had been written¦79714 in Hebrew, Latin¦79717, and Greek.
\v 21 But the Jewish chief¦79725 priests¦79725 complained to Pilate¦79723, “Don't write ‘The king of the Jews’, but rather ‘The one who \em said\em* he was king of the Jews’.”
\p
\v 22 However Pilate¦79745 answered¦79743, “What I've written, I've written.”
\p
\v 23 After the soldiers¦79751 had fastened \nd Yeshua\nd* to the stake¦79754, they took¦79758 his clothes¦79760 and¦79773 placed them in four¦79764 piles, one for each of them. This left his robe, which had been woven¦79780 from top to bottom in one piece.
\v 24 So they said to each other, “Rather than tearing this, let's throw a dice to see who will get it.” (This fulfilled¦79800 what was written in the scriptures¦79799\x + \xo 19:24: \xt Psa 22:18.\x* that said: they divided¦79803 my garments among themselves¦79808 and threw¦79814 a dice for my clothes¦79806.) So they went ahead and did that.
\p
\v 25 Meanwhile a group of women had stayed standing near \nd Yeshua\nd* on the stake¦79826: his mother and his aunt, Maria the wife of Clopas¦79841, and Maria from Magdala¦79845.
\v 26 When \nd Yeshua\nd* saw his mother and also the apprentice¦79854 that he loved standing nearby, he said to her, “\wj Look, he'll be your¦79868 son.\wj*”
\v 27 And to the apprentice he said, “\wj Look¦79873, she'll be your¦79877 mother¦79876.\wj*” And that apprentice took¦79884 her into his own \add home\add* from then¦79878 on.

\r (Mat. 27:45-56; Mark 15:33-41; Luke 23:44-49)
\p
\v 28 Having done this, \nd Yeshua\nd* knew that everything had been accomplished¦79903, and (in order¦79904 for the scriptures¦79908\x + \xo 19:28: \xt Psa 69:21; 22:15.\x* to be fulfilled¦79903) said, “\wj I'm thirsty¦79910.\wj*”
\p
\v 29 There was a container lying¦79914 there¦79921 full of vinegary wine, so they placed a sponge¦79920 on a hyssop¦79926 stalk¦79926, soaked it in the wine, and held it up to his mouth¦79931.
\v 30 After \nd Yeshua\nd* had sucked some wine out, he said¦79939, “\wj It is finished¦79940.\wj*” Then¦79941 he bowed¦79942 his head and¦79941 gave¦79945 up his spirit¦79948.

\v 31 Now because it was the preparation¦79953 day\x + \xo 19:31: \xt Yhn 19:14.\x* for the coming Rest Day, the Jews didn't¦79956 want the bodies¦79962 to remain¦79957 on the stakes¦79960 after dusk (because it was even a special Rest Day.) So¦79950 they asked¦79978 Pilate¦79981 to command for their legs to be broken¦79983 \add to hasten their deaths\add* and then they could be taken¦79988 down \add sooner\add*.
\v 32 So¦79990 the soldiers¦79992 came¦79989 and broke¦79997 the legs of the men on each side of Yeshua,
\v 33 but when they got to him, they saw¦80012 that he was already¦80015 dead so they didn't¦80019 break his¦80021 legs.
\v 34 Instead one of the soldiers¦80027 stabbed his¦80029 side with a spear¦80028 and immediately¦80036 blood¦80037 and water¦80039 came¦80035 out.

\p
\v 38 After all of this, Yosef from Arimathea¦80095 went to Pilate. (Yosef was a follower of Yeshua, but secretly because¦80102 he was afraid of what the Jewish leaders might do.) He asked¦80088 Pilate for permission¦80114 to remove \nd Yeshua's\nd* body, and it was granted to him so they went and got his body.
\v 39 \x + \xo 19:39: \xt Yhn 3:1-2.\x*Nicodemus¦80132 (the one who had first¦80142 visited Yeshua at night¦80140) also came¦80129, bringing¦80143 around 30kg of burial spices.
\v 40 So¦80155 they took¦80154 \nd Yeshua's\nd* body¦80157 and wrapped it¦80163 around with linen¦80165 strips with the spices¦80169 as per the Jewish burial customs¦80171.
\v 41 There was a garden out at the place¦80181 where¦80182 Yeshua had been executed¦80183, and¦80185 in the garden there¦80177 was a new tomb¦80189 that¦80192 hadn't been used yet.
\v 42 So¦80200 because it was the preparation¦80203 day¦80203 and because the tomb¦80210 was nearby, they¦80212 laid his body in there¦80199.

\v 1 The following Sunday, Maria¦80220 from Magdala¦80222 went out to the tomb very early¦80224 when it was still¦80226 dark, and¦80216 she saw that the stone¦80235 had been removed from the entrance.
\v 2 So¦80244 she ran quickly and went to Simon¦80249 Peter¦80250 and the other¦80254 apprentice¦80255 that \nd Yeshua\nd* loved, and told them, “They've taken the \nd master's¦80265\nd* \add body\add* out of the tomb¦80268 and we don't¦80270 know where¦80272 they've put it.”
\p
\v 3 So¦80276 Peter¦80278 and the other¦80281 apprentice¦80282 went¦80275 out to the tomb¦80287.
\v 4 They were running¦80289 together¦80293, but the other¦80297 apprentice¦80298 was a bit faster than Peter¦80303 and¦80290 so he got to the tomb¦80310 first¦80306.
\v 5 Without going in, he stooped¦80313 down at the entrance and looked in and saw the linen¦80317 strips lying¦80315 there¦80315.
\v 6 But¦80328 Peter¦80329 came¦80333 along behind him¦80331 and went¦80333 straight into the tomb¦80336 and also saw the linen¦80340 strips lying¦80341 there¦80341.
\v 7 But the piece of cloth¦80354 that¦80345 had been on the head wasn't lying¦80355 there¦80355 with the linen¦80354 strips, but¦80356 had been folded and¦80342 placed¦80361 separately¦80357.
\v 8 So¦80363 now the other¦80367 apprentice¦80368 who had arrived first¦80371 also went¦80364 inside and he saw¦80376 it all and believed¦80378 \add that¦80369 Yeshua had risen\add*.

\v 11 But Maria¦80399 had stayed there outside¦80408 the tomb weeping. But when she stooped¦80414 down and looked into the tomb,
\v 12 she saw two¦80420 messengers¦80421 dressed in white¦80424 sitting¦80425 there—one at the head end and one at the feet¦80434 end of the slab where¦80435 \nd Yeshua's¦80440\nd* body¦80438 had been lying¦80436.
\v 13 They spoke to her¦80443, “Woman¦80445, why are you¦80447 crying?”
\p “Because¦80453 they've taken away my¦80457 \nd master¦80456\nd*,” she replied, “and¦80458 I don't¦80459 know where¦80461 they've put him¦80464.”
\p
\v 14 \nd Then\nd* she turned¦80468 back around and saw \nd Yeshua\nd* standing there, but she didn't¦80479 realise who it was.
\v 15 \nd Yeshua\nd* asked her, “\wj Woman¦80490, why are you crying? Who are you looking¦80494 for¦80494?\wj*”
\p Maria assumed he might be the gardener¦80500, so she answered, “Mister¦80504, if you took the body, tell me where¦80515 you put it and I'll get it taken away \add for you\add*.”
\p
\v 16 \nd Yeshua\nd* just answered, “\wj Maria¦80528.\wj*”
\p She spun around and said, “My teacher!” (‘Rabboni¦80535’ in Hebrew.)
\p
\v 17 “\wj Don't touch¦80546 me,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* said to her, “\wj because¦80549 I haven't gone back up to the father yet, but go and tell my brothers¦80560 that I'm going up to my father and the father of you all, and my god and the god of you all.\wj*”

\v 1 After¦80962 all this, \nd Yeshua\nd* revealed himself again¦80968 to his apprentices¦80973 at Lake Galilee. It happened like this:

\v 5 He called out, “\wj Hey, young fellas. Don't you¦81082 have any fish¦81081?\wj*”
\p “None.” they answered¦81083.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 21:6: \xt Luk 5:6.\x*Then¦81087 he said, “\wj Throw the net out over the right¦81094 side of the boat¦81097 and you'll find some.\wj*” So¦81087 they did it and they caught so many fish that the net was too heavy to pull back in.
\p
\v 7 Now the apprentice¦81149 that \nd Yeshua\nd* loved said to Peter, “It's the master!” When Simon¦81161 Peter heard¦81164 that, he put on his robe (because¦81173 he didn't have it on), and jumped overboard into the lake¦81181.
\v 8 The other¦81184 apprentices¦81185 followed in the little¦81188 boat¦81188 dragging¦81203 the net¦81205 behind them because¦81192 they¦81193 were only about¦81199 100m out from the shore.
\v 9 When they went up the beach, they saw some bread¦81222 there and a charcoal¦81216 fire¦81216 with fish¦81219 cooking on it¦81220
\v 10 and \nd Yeshua¦81226\nd* told them, “\wj Bring¦81227 some of the fish¦81231 that¦81232 you¦81233 just caught¦81233.\wj*”
\p
\v 11 So¦81237 Simon¦81238 Peter¦81239 went and dragged¦81241 the net up onto the beach. Amazingly it hadn't torn even though it contained 153 large¦81254 fish.
\v 12 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* said, “\wj Now, come and have breakfast¦81270.\wj*” But none of the apprentices¦81276 dared to ask who he was, because they figured it must be the \nd master¦81285\nd*.
\v 13 \nd Yeshua\nd* brought the bread¦81294 to them and shared it around, and then likewise¦81303 for the fish¦81302.
\p
\v 14 This was now the third¦81307 time¦81307 that \nd Yeshua\nd* had appeared to his apprentices¦81312 since he'd come back to life.

\v 15 While they were eating, Yeshua asked Simon Peter¦81325, “\wj Simon, son of Yohan, do you love me more than these¦81335?\wj*”
\p Peter answered, “Yes, \nd master¦81339\nd*, you know that I love you.”
\p Yeshua responded, “\wj Feed my¦81353 lambs¦81352.\wj*”
\v 16 Then he asked again¦81357, “\wj Simon¦81363, son of Yohan, do you love me?\wj*”
\p Peter replied, “Yes, \nd master¦81371\nd*, you know that I love you.”
\p Yeshua responded, “\wj Shepherd my¦81384 sheep¦81382.\wj*”
\v 17 Then¦81407 he asked a third time, “\wj Simon¦81389, son of Yohan, do you love me?\wj*”
\p Peter¦81398 was now upset that he'd been asked a third time if he loved him, and¦81407 he answered, “\nd Master¦81411\nd*, you know everything.”
\p “\wj Feed my¦81430 sheep,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* responded¦81400.
\v 18 “\wj I can assure you that while you are young¦81438, you dress yourself¦81440 and go wherever you want to go, but as you age, you'll be stretching¦81448 out your¦81453 hands¦81451 and others will dress you and will take you where you don't¦81473 want to go.\wj*”
\v 19 When he said this, Yeshua was indicating how Peter would die honouring \nd God¦81485\nd*, and¦81477 he told Peter, “\wj Keep following¦81491 me.\wj*”

\v 20 \x + \xo 21:20: \xt Yhn 13:25.\x*When Peter¦81496 turned¦81493 around he saw that the apprentice¦81499 that Yeshua loved was following¦81504 them—the one who'd leaned on \nd Yeshua's\nd* chest¦81513 during the supper¦81510 and asked who the one was who would turn Yeshua over.
\v 21 Noticing him, Peter¦81532 asked \nd Yeshua\nd*, “\nd Master¦81538\nd*, what about¦81541 that one?”
\p
\v 22 But \nd Yeshua\nd* replied, “\wj If I want him to stay alive until¦81551 I come back, what business would it¦81553 be of yours? You just stay following¦81559 me.\wj*”
\p
\v 23 As a result of that, a rumour went¦81561 around the others that that one wouldn't die, but \nd Yeshua\nd* never said that. (He only said, “\wj If I want him to stay alive until¦81596 I come back, what business would it be of yours?\wj*”)
