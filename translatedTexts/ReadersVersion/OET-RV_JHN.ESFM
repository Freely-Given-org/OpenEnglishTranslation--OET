\mt2 The account of Yeshua's ministry by
\mt1 Yohan (John)
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua (Jesus) was written by Yohan (John), brother of Yacob (mistakenly known in older English Bibles as James). Both of them were in the small group of twelve close followers of Yeshua that he selected as his apprentices and who accompanied him around as he taught. Out of the twelve, Yohan was the one that greatly loved Yeshua, and his closeness gave him much of the insight that he includes with his description of Yeshua's actions and teaching. The two brothers were the sons of Zebedee, and all three of them worked as fishermen on Lake Galilee.
\is2 This account
\ip The \em Open English Translation\em* places Yohan's account before the others because it begins with the eternal existence of Yeshua the messiah. Not only is Yeshua the godly messenger, he was also the creator who has now descended from heaven as a man. Omitting any mention of the baby Yeshua, Yohan does however tell us about Yohan-the-immerser who came before Yeshua to prepare the people for the arrival of the promised messiah.
\ip In chapters two to twelve it's written how the various miracles that Yeshua did showed that he was the promised messiah who would offer life without ending to anyone who would accept that he had been sent by God and trust in his teaching. Although there were indeed many who did believe in him, many others were unable to come to that point and ended up opposing Yeshua at every turn.
\ip In chapters thirteen to seventeen, the compassion of Yeshua towards his followers is described. He also told them in advance of his impending brutal death.
\ip In the final few chapters, we read about the arrest and judging of Yeshua, his being fastened to a pole and giving up his spirit, his coming back to life, and how his followers saw him and spoke with him again during that period.
\ip Yohan is careful to explain how to receive life without ending by means of believing that Yeshua came down from heaven and obeying his teaching. Yeshua himself is the path and the truth and the life (14:6).

\p
\v 1 In the beginning¦62914 was the message,\f + \fr 1:1 \ft TD: This passage is complex to translate because the message was also the messenger—that is, Yeshua came not only to teach about getting saved, but also to become the actual way to be saved!\f* and the message was with God, and the message was \add and is\add* God.
\v 2 He, \add the message\add*, was with \nd God¦62937\nd* \add even\add* at the creation¦62934 \add of the universe\add*.
\v 3 Everything came into existence through¦62939 the messenger\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Lit. him.\f*—\add ≈there's not even one thing that came into existence that wasn't made by\add* him.
\v 4 He holds life, and that life is the light¦62962 of humankind.
\v 5 And that light¦62967 is shining¦62971 in the darkness, and darkness cannot overcome him.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt Mat 3:1; Mrk 1:4; Luk 3:1-2.\x*A man¦62979 arrived who had been sent¦62980 by \nd God¦62984\nd*. His name¦62987 was Yohan¦62989.
\v 7 He came as a testimony¦62995 to tell about the light so that everyone would believe¦63003 the light.
\v 8 Yohan himself wasn't the light—he was merely the announcer of the light.
\v 9 The true light¦63020 which¦63023 enlightens¦63024 every¦63025 person¦63026 was coming¦63027 into the world¦63030.
\p
\v 10 He was in the world and he's the creator of the world, and yet the world didn't¦63047 even know him.
\v 11 He came¦63052 to his own chosen people, but they wouldn't accept him¦63056,
\v 12 however anyone who would accept him and trusted in his¦63077 authority, he gave¦63064 them the right¦63068 to become¦63071 children¦63069 of \nd God¦63070\nd*—
\v 13 not physical children and not coming from human actions, but¦63090 children of \nd God¦63092\nd*.
\p
\v 14 And the message¦63097 became¦63099 a human and lived here among¦63102 us and we¦63105 saw¦63105 his¦63108 greatness—the greatness of an only child of the father¦63113—full of grace¦63116 and truth¦63118.
\p
\v 15 Yohan¦63119 explained about him and loudly told everyone, “This is the one I meant when I said¦63130, ‘There's someone coming¦63136 after¦63134 me, yet who came before me, because¦63141 he existed before I did!’ ”
\p
\v 16 Because¦63145 he has so much, we all received¦63154 grace and then even more grace.
\v 17 The commandments came to us through Mosheh, but grace¦63168 and truth¦63171 came to us through \nd Yeshua¦63173\nd* the \nd messiah¦63174\nd*.
\v 18 No one has ever actually seen¦63178 God, but the human son born from God the father¦63193 and in close touch with him, he was the one to explain¦63195 God to us.

\p
\v 19 Yohan¦63203 explained some of this when the Jewish leaders sent¦63205 out priests¦63213 and¦63214 temple workers from Yerushalem¦63212 to ask¦63219 him¦63222, “Who are you¦63224?”
\p
\v 20 He didn't¦63230 flinch from the truth and so he told them, “I am not the \nd chosen¦63240 messiah¦63240\nd*.”
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21: a \xt Mal 4:5; \xo b \xt Deu 18:15,18.\x*So¦63241 they asked him again, “Are you Eliyyah come back to life?”
\p And he answered, “No, I'm not.”
\p They asked, “Are you the prophet¦63263?”
\p Again he answered, “No, I'm not.”
\p
\v 22 So¦63271 they asked him¦63272, “Who are you then? We need to give¦63278 an answer¦63277 to the ones who sent¦63280 us. How do you describe yourself¦63286?”
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*So he said, “I am a voice¦63289 shouting¦63290\f + \fr 1:23 \ft We've deliberately omitted putting a comma here, because it's also possible that the comma should go after ‘wilderness’.\f* in the wilderness smooth the path¦63296 of the \nd master¦63297\nd*, as the prophet¦63307 Isayah¦63305 said.”
\p
\v 24 Some of the ones sent¦63310 out were members of the Pharisee¦63314 party¦63314.
\v 25 These ones asked¦63316 Yohan, “So¦63323 why are you immersing¦63324 people then if you aren't¦63327 the \nd messiah¦63330\nd* or Eliyyah or the prophet¦63337?”
\p
\v 26 He answered¦63338, “I'm immersing¦63344 people in water¦63348, but somewhere here among us all there's someone you don't¦63358 know—
\v 27 the one coming¦63365 after¦63363 me, and I'm not even good enough to untie¦63378 his¦63379 sandal¦63383 straps¦63381!”
\p
\v 28 All this happened in Bethany¦63388 on the east side of the Yordan¦63393 River where¦63395 Yohan¦63398 was immersing¦63399 people.

\v 29 The next day¦63402 Yohan saw \nd Yeshua¦63408\nd* coming¦63409 towards him¦63411, and¦63412 said, “Hey! Here's the sacrificial lamb of \nd God¦63418\nd* who's come to take away the sin¦63423 of the world¦63426.
\v 30 This is the man¦63439 I was talking about when I said¦63433, ‘There's someone coming¦63438 after me, yet who came before me, because¦63444 he¦63447 existed before I did.’
\v 31 I didn't¦63449 know who he was but¦63452 nevertheless I came¦63460 and immersed¦63465 people in water¦63464 so that this man could be revealed¦63454 to \add all\add* Israel¦63456.”
\p
\v 32 And Yohan¦63469 further explained, “I saw God's \nd spirit¦63474\nd* come down and¦63483 settle on him¦63487.
\v 33 I didn't¦63491 know which one was him, but the one who sent me to immerse people in water¦63501 said, ‘When you see the spirit coming¦63513 down and settling on someone, he is the one who will immerse people with God's holy spirit.’
\v 34 And I have seen¦63530 that, and so I can assure you that he is God's son.”

\p
\v 35 The next day¦63542, Yohan¦63547 was back there with two¦63553 of his¦63552 apprentices¦63551
\v 36 and noticing \nd Yeshua¦63557\nd* walking¦63558 nearby he said, “Look¦63560! There's the \add sacrificial\add* lamb of \nd God¦63564\nd*.”
\p
\v 37 When his¦63579 two¦63578 apprentices¦63580 heard¦63574 him say that, they left him and followed¦63585 \nd Yeshua¦63587\nd*.
\v 38 But¦63602 \nd Yeshua¦63591\nd* turned¦63588 and saw them following¦63595 him, and asked them, “\wj What do you two want?\wj*”
\p And they said¦63603 to him, “Teacher¦63611, where do you live?”
\p
\v 39 “\wj Come and see,\wj*” Yeshua replied. So¦63622 they went¦63620 with him and saw¦63624 where¦63626 he lived, and then they stayed there that night, because it was already late afternoon.
\p
\v 40 Andrew¦63643, the brother¦63645 of Simon¦63646 Peter¦63647 was one of those two¦63652 who heard¦63654 Yohan¦63656 and¦63657 then followed¦63658 Yeshua.
\v 41 As soon as he found his brother¦63666, he said to Simon¦63669, “We have found the messiah¦63675—God's chosen one,”
\v 42 and led him to Yeshua. When Yeshua saw him, he said¦63694, “\wj Ah, you are Simon¦63698, Yohan's son, but from now on you'll be called¦63704 Peter which¦63706 means \+it stone\+it*.\wj*”

\p
\v 43 The following¦63727 day¦63710, \nd Yeshua¦63726\nd* wanted¦63712 to go to Galilee¦63718. He found Philip¦63721 and¦63722 told him¦63724, “\wj Follow me!\wj*”
\v 44 Philip¦63732 was from the town of Bethsaida¦63734 where Andrew¦63740 and¦63741 Peter¦63742 lived.
\v 45 Philip then found \nd Nathanael¦63746\nd* and told him¦63749, “We've¦63759 found the one that Mosheh and the prophets¦63758 wrote¦63751 about in the Scriptures. He's \nd Yeshua¦63760\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦63769\nd*.”
\p
\v 46 And \nd Nathanael¦63773\nd* said¦63771, “Does anything good¦63778 come from \nd Nazareth¦63775\nd*?”
\p So¦63770 Philip¦63784 answered, “Well, come and¦63786 see¦63787 \add for yourself\add*.”
\p
\v 47 \nd Yeshua¦63792\nd* saw¦63788 \nd Nathanael¦63794\nd* approaching and¦63798 said, “\wj Ah, this is an honest Israeli¦63806.\wj*”
\p
\v 48 But \nd Nathanael¦63815\nd* queried him, “Where do you know \em me\em* from?”
\p And \nd Yeshua¦63822\nd* replied, “\wj Actually I saw¦63835 you under¦63832 that fig¦63834 tree¦63834 before Philip¦63829 had even called you.\wj*”

\p
\v 1 On the Tuesday\f + \fr 2:1 \ft Or possibly, ‘Three days later’.\f*, there was a wedding¦63917 in Cana¦63922 in Galilee¦63924, and¦63925 \nd Yeshua's¦63930\nd* mother¦63928 was there
\v 2 and \nd Yeshua¦63936\nd* and his¦63941 apprentices¦63940 were also invited¦63932.
\v 3 When the wine ran out at the wedding, his mother¦63961 said to him¦63966, “They haven't got any more wine.”
\p
\v 4 \nd Yeshua¦63976\nd* answered, “\wj What does that have to do with us, mother? It's not the time for my¦63987 ministry yet.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 But his¦63991 mother¦63990 told the servants¦63993, “Just do whatever¦63994 he tells you.”
\p
\v 6 Now there were six¦64008 empty stone¦64006 water¦64007 jars there that are used for Jewish purification¦64012 ceremonies. (Each one could hold over 70 litres.)
\v 7 So¦64034 \nd Yeshua¦64029\nd* told them to fill the jars with water¦64033, and they¦64035 filled¦64035 them up.
\v 8 Then¦64039 he said, “\wj Okay, now take a sample out and give it to the MC.\wj*” So¦64039 they took some
\v 9 and when the MC tasted¦64054 the water that had now turned to wine, not knowing¦64063 where¦64064 it had come from he called the groom
\v 10 and exclaimed, “Most people supply the best wine at the beginning \add of the reception\add*, and the cheaper stuff when people are a bit tipsy. But you've kept¦64099 the best wine until¦64103 last!”
\p
\v 11 This event in Cana¦64116, Galilee¦64119, was the first of the miracles that \nd Yeshua¦64114\nd* did, and it revealed¦64122 his greatness and his followers believed¦64127 that he was from God.

\v 14 There in the temple¦64186, he discovered merchants selling¦64188 cows and sheep¦64193 and doves¦64197, and moneychangers¦64201 sitting¦64202 at their tables.
\v 15 Yeshua formed some cords¦64209 into a whip and drove the sheep¦64220 and cows out of the temple¦64215 grounds, and he overturned¦64236 the tables¦64234—spilling the coins¦64231 of the moneychangers¦64226 onto the ground.
\v 16 He scolded the ones selling¦64243 doves¦64242, saying, “\wj Get them out of here! Don't be making¦64250 my¦64255 father's¦64254 house into a market.\wj*”
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Psa 69:9.\x*That reminded¦64260 his¦64264 followers of the scripture: “I'll be filled with zeal for your¦64275 temple.”

\p
\v 21 But Yeshua had been meaning his¦64342 own body¦64341 when he was talking¦64336 about the temple¦64339.
\v 22 In the future when he was actually raised¦64346 from the dead¦64348, his¦64352 followers remembered this statement, and they believed¦64359 both the \add Hebrew\add* scriptures¦64361 and \nd Yeshua's¦64369\nd* message¦64364.

\v 2 went¦64446 to Yeshua and said¦64454, “Teacher, we know that God has sent you as a teacher¦64462, because¦64465 no one could do these¦64467 kinds of miracles if God wasn't with him.”
\p
\v 3 \nd Yeshua¦64486\nd* responded¦64488, “\wj I'll tell you frankly that no one can enter God's kingdom¦64504 unless he is reborn.\wj*”
\p
\v 4 Nicodemus questioned, “How can an adult be reborn? A person¦64514 can't¦64521 just return to their mother's¦64527 womb and¦64531 then get born a second¦64529 time!”
\p
\v 5 But \nd Yeshua¦64536\nd* continued, “\wj Honestly, I'm telling¦64539 you¦64540: unless a person is born from both water¦64547 \+em and¦64548\+em* the \+nd spirit¦64549\+nd*, they can't¦64542 enter God's kingdom¦64557.\wj*

\v 22 After¦64896 this, \nd Yeshua¦64900\nd* and his¦64908 followers went¦64898 down to Yudea, and stayed there¦64915 and immersed¦64920 some believers.
\v 23 Yohan¦64925 was also immersing¦64926 people at Aenon¦64928 near Salim¦64932 because¦64933 there was plenty of water¦64934 there and people would come \add to him\add* to get immersed¦64941.

\v 26 So¦64966 some people went¦64969 to Yohan¦64972 and said¦64974, “Teacher, that man that came¦64969 to you across the river and that you testified¦64988 about, now \em he's\em* immersing¦64992 people and so they're all going to him.”
\p
\v 27 “None¦65004 of us get anything if it's not being given¦65016 from heaven¦65020,” Yohan¦64999 answered¦64998.

\p
\v 1 When \nd Yeshua¦65211\nd* found out that the Pharisee¦65209 party¦65209 knew¦65202 that he was gaining and immersing¦65216 more followers than Yohan¦65218 had,
\v 2 (although actually it wasn't \nd Yeshua¦65221\nd* himself¦65222 that was immersing¦65225 them, but¦65226 his¦65229 trainees that were doing it),
\v 3 he left Yudea¦65232 and went¦65235 back up to Galilee¦65239.
\v 4 On the way up, he decided to go through Samaria¦65246 \add (Heb. Shomron)\add*.
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 4:5: \xt Gen 33:19; Josh 24:32.\x*By choosing that route, they came to a town in Samaria¦65252 called¦65253 Sukar, which¦65258 was near the place that the \add patriarch\add* Yosef¦65263 had inherited from his¦65266 father Yacob¦65261,
\v 6 and Yacob's¦65272 well was there¦65269. \nd Yeshua¦65275\nd* was tired from all the walking and was sitting¦65281 by the well around midday.
\p
\v 7 A woman¦65297 came from the town to get water¦65302 from the well, and \nd Yeshua¦65306\nd* asked her¦65304 for a drink¦65309
\v 8 since his¦65314 followers had gone into the town to buy some lunch.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 4:9: \xt Est 4:1-5; Neh 4:1-2.\x*The woman said to him, “You're a Jew¦65331. How come you're asking me for a drink¦65337 when I'm from Samaria?” (Jews¦65349 don't¦65346 normally associate¦65348 with anyone from Samaria.)
\p
\v 10 \nd Yeshua¦65354\nd* answered¦65352, “\wj If you had recognised God's gift¦65361 and who it is who's asking you for a drink, you would have asked me and I would have given you \+em living¦65383\+em* water¦65382 \+add to drink\+add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 11 But the woman¦65389 countered, “Mister¦65390, you don't even have \add rope and\add* a bucket¦65393 to reach the water in the deep well. How then could you get ‘living¦65413 water’?
\v 12 I doubt that you're greater¦65416 than our¦65421 ancestor Yacob¦65422 who made this well for us and drank¦65437 this water along with his children and his animals.”
\p
\v 13 \nd Yeshua¦65448\nd* responded¦65450, “\wj Everyone¦65453 who drinks¦65455 this water¦65458 will get thirsty¦65460 again¦65461,\wj*
\v 14 \wj but whoever¦65462 drinks¦65467 the water that I give them will find a well springing up inside them—springing into eternal¦65500 life¦65499.\wj*”
\p
\v 15 So the woman¦65505 said, “Okay, then. Give me some of that water¦65511 so that I won't get thirsty¦65514 and won't have to keep coming out here to the well.”
\p
\v 16 Yeshua said, “\wj First, go and get your¦65534 husband¦65533 and return here.\wj*”
\p
\v 17 “I don't have a husband!” she retorted.
\p “\wj True enough—indeed you don't,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦65552\nd* said.
\v 18 “\wj You've had five¦65561 husbands¦65563 and you're not married to the man you're living with, so that was true.\wj*”
\p
\v 19 “Mister¦65582, I can see that you're¦65587 a prophet¦65585,” the woman¦65581 reacted.
\v 20 “Our¦65590 ancestors¦65589 worshipped on this mountain¦65594, but you¦65598 Jews claim that people should only worship there in Yerushalem¦65602.”
\p
\v 21 Then \nd Yeshua¦65613\nd* told her, “\wj You need to believe¦65615 that I was sent from God, woman¦65618, because¦65619 a day is coming¦65620 when everyone will be worshipping¦65635 him neither¦65624 on this mountain¦65628, nor in Yerushalem¦65634.\wj*
\v 22 \wj You people in Samaria don't¦65641 even know who you¦65642 worship, but we do, because¦65647 people will be saved by means of us Jews¦65652.\wj*

\v 24 \wj \+nd God¦65686\+nd* is spirit, and the ones worshipping him must worship in spirit and total honesty.\wj*”
\p
\v 25 The woman¦65703 said, “I'm aware that the messiah¦65707 is coming¦65708—the chosen one of God. Whenever he appears, he'll teach us everything.”
\p
\v 26 “\wj \+em I am\+em* the messiah,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦65723\nd* responded. “\wj Yes, he's speaking¦65727 to you¦65728!\wj*”
\rem /s1 The Disciples Rejoin Jesus
\p
\v 27 After this, his¦65738 followers arrived back, and they were astounded that he was speaking with a woman¦65744. However no one dared ask her, “What are you after¦65730?” Or to ask him, “Why are you talking¦65745 with her?”
\p
\v 28 So¦65761 the woman¦65769 left her¦65766 water¦65765 jar there, and went¦65771 back into the town where she told the people¦65778,
\v 29 “Come and see¦65780 a man¦65781 who knew as much about me as I know myself! He must be the \nd messiah¦65794\nd*!”
\v 30 So they¦65802 went¦65796 out from the town to go and¦65801 see Yeshua.
\p
\v 31 Meanwhile, Yeshua's followers encouraged him, “Teacher, here, eat.”
\p
\v 32 But he¦65820 said¦65822, “\wj I've had food to eat¦65827 that you¦65829 don't¦65830 know about.\wj*”
\p
\v 33 This made his followers ask each other, “Did you see anyone¦65843 bring him¦65845 something¦65845 to eat¦65846?”
\p
\v 34 “\wj Obeying God who sent¦65860 me is like food to me, and¦65862 I plan to finish his¦65864 work,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦65850\nd* explained.
\v 35 “\wj Don't you all have a saying about needing to wait four months¦65872 for a harvest? But I'm telling you that you all should open your¦65886 eyes¦65885 and look at the fields¦65890, because¦65891 they're already¦65896 lightening up as harvest time approaches.\wj*

\rem /s1 Many Samaritans Believe

\v 39 And many people of Samaria¦65969 came out of that town and believed¦65965 that Yeshua is God because¦65970 the woman¦65974 had told them that he knew everything about her.
\v 40 So¦65991 when they all came¦65987, they asked him to stay in their town and they stayed on there¦66004 for a couple of days¦66006.
\p
\v 41 As a result of his¦66016 teaching, many more believed¦66012

\p
\v 46 \x + \xo 4:46: \xt Yhn 2:1-11.\x*So¦66120 he went¦66118 again¦66121 to Cana¦66129 there in Galilee¦66132 where¦66133 he had made the water¦66137 into wine. Now there was a royal¦66144 official¦66144 there, whose¦66145 son in Capernaum¦66150 was ill.
\v 47 When the official heard¦66152 that \nd Yeshua¦66155\nd* was coming¦66156 up from Yudea¦66160 to Galilee¦66163, he went¦66164 and asked him if he would come¦66173 and heal¦66176 his¦66177 son who was dying¦66183.
\v 48 \nd Yeshua¦66187\nd* said¦66184 to him¦66189, “\wj You people won't¦66191 believe¦66199 unless you see¦66196 miracles and other marvels.\wj*”

\p
\v 50 “\wj Go back there and see,\wj*” Yeshua responded¦66234. “\wj Your¦66224 son will recover.\wj*”
\p The man¦66229 believed¦66227 what Yeshua had told him, and so he started off.
\v 51 On his way, his slaves¦66249 met him and reported¦66256 that the boy¦66263 was alive and well.
\p
\v 52 So¦66268 the official asked them what time it was that he got better¦66278, and they replied that the fever¦66294 had subsided around 1pm.
\v 53 The father¦66298 knew¦66295 that that was the time when Yeshua had told him that his son would recover, and as a result his whole¦66323 household¦66321 believed¦66317 \add that Yeshua came from God\add*.

\v 1 After¦66342 all this, there¦66344 was another Jewish feast¦66346, so \nd Yeshua¦66352\nd* went¦66350 down to Yerushalem¦66354.
\v 2 In Yerushalem¦66359 at the Sheep Gate, there's¦66355 the Bethsaida¦66373 pool that has five¦66377 alcoves
\v 3 and a large number of sick, blind¦66389, lame, and paralysed¦66391 people¦66385 lie there in them.
\v 4 ◘
\v 5 One man¦66434 had been there¦66435 for thirty-eight¦66438 years¦66441,
\v 6 and when \nd Yeshua¦66451\nd* noticed him and knew that he'd been there for so long, he asked, “\wj Do you want to get better?\wj*”
\p
\v 7 “Yes mister,” the sick man answered¦66468, “but¦66493 when the water¦66482 starts moving, I don't¦66476 have a companion to lift me into the pool, so someone else always get there before¦66497 me.”
\p
\v 8 Then \nd Yeshua¦66504\nd* said, “\wj Stand up and pick up your¦66512 bedroll and start walking¦66514.\wj*”
\v 9 The man immediately¦66516 stood up, picked up his¦66531 gear, and started to walk¦66533.
\p However, this was the weekly rest day.
\v 10 \x + \xo 5:10: \xt Neh 13:19; Jer 17:21.\x*So¦66543 the religious leaders said to the man, “Hey! It's against the law for you to carry your¦66560 bedding¦66558 on the rest day¦66549!”
\p

\p
\v 12 “Oh. Who was it that told you¦66595 to take that stuff and¦66601 start walking¦66602?”
\p
\v 13 But the man who had been healed¦66606 didn't¦66608 even know who it was, because \nd Yeshua¦66616\nd* had quickly left when a crowd¦66619 had formed.

\v 14 Later on, \nd Yeshua¦66631\nd* found the man in the temple¦66636 and told him, “\wj Look¦66641, you're better now so don't go on sinning¦66645, because you don't want anything worse¦66648 to happen to you.\wj*”

\v 16 As a result, the leaders started harassing \nd Yeshua¦66687\nd* because he had done this on a rest day¦66699.

\p
\v 18 Because of this, the leaders became determined that he must be put to death—not just because he broke the rules for the rest day¦66732, but most of all because he was calling¦66737 God his own father¦66735, thus making¦66743 himself¦66742 equal¦66741 to God!

\v 21 \wj Because¦66836 the father¦66838 brings the dead back to life, giving them new life, so too the son can give life to anyone who he wants.\wj*

\p
\v 24 “\wj I assure you that anyone who hears my¦66899 message¦66898 and believes¦66902 that I was sent by God, will live forever and will not be condemned, but has moved from death¦66920 into life.\wj*
\v 25 \wj I can also assure you¦66927 that a time is coming¦66929, and in fact is here already, when the dead¦66936 will be hearing¦66939 the voice of God's son and that voice will bring them back to life.\wj*
\v 26 \wj As the father¦66955 is the source of life, he gave the power of giving life to the son\wj*
\v 27 \wj and gave¦66978 him the authority¦66976 to be the final judge, because¦66984 he is humanity's child.\wj*
\v 28 \wj Don't be surprised at this, because¦66991 a time is coming¦66992 when everyone in their graves will be hearing¦67007 his¦67010 voice¦67009,\wj*

\v 2 A large crowd¦67391 followed¦67388 him¦67390 because¦67394 they'd seen his miraculous healings of sick people.
\v 3 \nd Yeshua¦67417\nd* climbed a hill and¦67418 sat there¦67419 with his¦67426 apprentices¦67425.
\v 4 At that time, it was getting close to the Jewish Festival of Passover.
\v 5 When \nd Yeshua¦67445\nd* looked out and saw the large crowd coming¦67452, he asked Philip¦67458, “\wj Where can we get enough food from to feed all this crowd?\wj*”
\v 6 But¦67470 he was only saying¦67471 this to test Philip because¦67476 he already knew what he was going¦67479 to do.
\p
\v 7 Philip answered¦67482, “To buy even just a snack for this many people would take several months' wages!”
\p
\v 8 Now one of Yeshua's apprentices¦67506, Simon¦67511 Peter's brother¦67510, Andrew¦67508, said to Yeshua,
\v 9 “There's a young boy¦67514 here with five¦67520 buns and¦67523 two¦67524 \add small¦67514 cooked\add* fish¦67525, but¦67526 that wouldn't even start to feed this crowd.”
\p
\v 10 But¦67543 \nd Yeshua¦67537\nd* told them to get all the people¦67540 to sit¦67541 down as there¦67542 was a large grassy¦67545 area. So¦67553 they all sat¦67551 down—some five¦67562 thousand¦67562 men¦67556 were counted.
\v 11 Then he took the buns and gave¦67572 thanks¦67572 to God, and started passing around both the buns and the fish¦67590, and everyone ate as much as they wanted.
\v 12 Once everyone was full, Yeshua got his¦67599 apprentices¦67598 to collect the leftover¦67602 fragments¦67604 so as not to waste anything¦67607.
\v 13 So¦67612 they gathered¦67611 the leftovers and filled¦67615 twelve¦67619 baskets¦67620 with leftover bread.
\p
\v 14 The people¦67635 who had witnessed this and other miracles said, “This really is the prophet¦67651 that God promised to send!”
\v 15 But \nd Yeshua¦67658\nd* knew that they intended to come and grab him to proclaim him as their king¦67672, so he moved out of the crowd and on up the hill.

\p
\v 16 As it¦67687 moved into evening¦67686, Yeshua's apprentices¦67690 went¦67688 back down to the lake¦67694
\v 17 and having¦67697 boarded¦67697 the boat¦67700, they¦67701 set out across¦67705 the lake¦67707 toward Capernaum¦67709. By then it was dark, and there was still no sign of \nd Yeshua¦67730\nd*.
\v 18 Then¦67732 a strong wind¦67735 hit the lake¦67734 and the water got rough.
\v 19 When they had rowed¦67740 about¦67744 five¦67749 kilometres, they saw \nd Yeshua¦67754\nd* walking¦67755 on top of the lake¦67759 and approaching the boat¦67764, and they were very scared.
\v 20 But he told them, “\wj Don't worry—it's me.\wj*”
\v 21 After that they were willing¦67778 to let him into the boat, and immediately¦67788 the boat was at their arrival place.

\p
\v 22 The next day, the crowd¦67806 looked across¦67810 the lake¦67812 and saw that only one small¦67817 boat had crossed, and they knew that only \nd Yeshua's¦67848\nd* apprentices had boarded that boat and left, and not Yeshua himself.
\v 23 Other boats¦67867 came¦67865 across from Tiberias¦67874 near the place¦67878 where¦67879 they¦67881 had eaten the bread¦67883 after the \nd master¦67886\nd* had given¦67884 thanks¦67884.
\v 24 So¦67889 when all the people saw¦67890 that Yeshua wasn't around and his¦67905 apprentices¦67904 had left, they went¦67919 off looking¦67922 for¦67922 Yeshua in Capernaum¦67921.

\rem /s1 Jesus the Bread of Life
\p
\v 25 When they found¦67927 him there across¦67929 the lake¦67931, they queried, “Teacher, how did you get here?”
\p
\v 26 “\wj Honestly, I know that you're not looking¦67951 for¦67951 me because you saw¦67955 \+add God working\+add* miracles,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦67944\nd* answered¦67941, “\wj but because you all had plenty of food to fill you up.\wj*
\v 27 \wj Don't \+add just\+add* work for the food which goes off, but¦67975 for the food which lasts forever—the food which humanity's child will give to you¦67989 because¦67992 \+nd God¦67997\+nd* the father¦67994 has put his mark of approval on him.\wj*”
\p
\v 28 Puzzled, they asked him¦68001, “What should we be doing if we want to work for \nd God¦68014\nd*?”
\p
\v 29 He answered, “\wj Doing God's work is putting your trust in the one that he sent¦68034 here.\wj*”
\p
\v 30 “If so,” they said¦68037, “what miracle will you do for us to see¦68050 so that we can believe¦68052 that you \add came from God\add*? What can \em you\em* do?
\v 31 \x + \xo 6:31: \xt Exo 16:4,15; Psa 78:24.\x*Our¦68058 ancestors¦68057 ate¦68061 the manna¦68060\f + \fr 6:31 \ft Manna was a word that meant ‘stuff’ and referred to some kind of flakes that regularly came down from the sky in the time of Mosheh and could be eaten as food.\f* out in the wilderness¦68064, just like Mosheh wrote¦68067, ‘He gave¦68073 them bread¦68069 from the sky to eat¦68076.’ ”
\p
\v 32 \nd Yeshua¦68081\nd* said to them, “\wj Actually I can tell you that it wasn't Mosheh who gave¦68088 them bread from heaven, but my¦68099 father¦68098 gives you the real bread from heaven,\wj*
\v 33 \wj because¦68111 God's bread¦68112 is the one who came down from heaven¦68121 and¦68122 who gives life¦68123 to the world¦68128.\wj*”
\p
\v 34 So¦68130 they¦68129 requested, “Mister¦68133, keep giving us that bread¦68139.”
\p
\v 35 “\wj \+em I am\+em* the bread¦68150 that gives life¦68152,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦68146\nd* answered, “\wj anyone who comes to me will never hunger¦68160, and¦68163 the one believing¦68165 in me, will never be thirsty¦68170 again.\wj*
\v 36 \wj But as I said¦68175 already, although you have seen¦68179 me you refuse to believe¦68184 me.\wj*
\v 37 \wj Everyone¦68186 that the father¦68191 gives to me will come to me, and¦68195 I certainly won't¦68202 turn away anyone who comes to me,\wj*
\v 38 \wj because I came¦68207 down from heaven¦68211, not to do what I want, but¦68220 to do what the one who sent¦68224 me wants.\wj*
\v 39 \wj And what he wants is for me to not lose anyone that he's given¦68239 to me, but to bring them back to life on the last day¦68255.\wj*
\v 40 \wj My¦68268 father¦68265 wants everyone¦68270 who watches me and believes¦68276 in me to live forever, because¦68258 I will bring them back to life¦68282 on that final day¦68292.\wj*”
\p
\v 41 This little speech made the religious leaders grumble¦68293 about¦68298 him because¦68300 he had said¦68301 that he was the food that came down from heaven¦68310,
\v 42 as they figured out, “This is \nd Yeshua¦68319\nd* the son of Yosef¦68323 and so we know his parents. So¦68311 how can he say that he came¦68347 down from heaven¦68346?”
\p
\v 43 \nd Yeshua¦68352\nd* scolded them, “\wj Don't be grumbling¦68358 to each other.\wj*
\v 44 \wj No one can join me unless the father¦68370 who sent¦68373 me attracts them, and¦68379 then I'll be bringing them back to life on that final day¦68387.\wj*
\v 45 \x + \xo 6:45: \xt Isa 54:13.\x*\wj The prophets¦68392 wrote¦68389 that the people will be taught¦68396 by \+nd God¦68398\+nd*. And everyone who's heard¦68403 and¦68407 learned¦68408 from the father¦68406 comes to me.\wj*
\v 46 \wj Not that any person has seen the father—only the one who came from \+nd God¦68429\+nd* has seen him.\wj*
\v 47 \wj I tell you¦68439 sincerely: anyone who believes¦68442 \+add in me\+add* will live forever.\wj*
\v 48 \wj \+em I am\+em* the bread¦68451 that gives true life¦68453.\wj*
\v 49 \wj Your¦68456 ancestors¦68455 ate¦68457 manna¦68466 in the wilderness¦68464, but they¦68468 all went on to die.\wj*
\v 50 \wj But \+em I am\+em* the bread¦68472 that came down from heaven¦68476 and¦68486 anyone¦68481 who eats this will not die¦68489.\wj*
\v 51 \wj \+em I am\+em* the living bread that came down from heaven¦68500 and if anyone¦68504 eats this bread, he will live through to the next age.\wj*”
\p
\v 52 At this point, the religious leaders began to argue with each other, “How could this man give¦68555 us his¦68561 flesh¦68558 to eat¦68562?”
\p
\v 53 So¦68564 \nd Yeshua¦68567\nd* explained, “\wj Indeed if you don't¦68574 eat¦68576 my flesh¦68578 and drink¦68585 my blood¦68589, you aren't¦68574 truly¦68569 alive!\wj*
\v 54 \wj Anyone who eats my flesh¦68606 and drinks¦68609 my blood¦68613 will gain eternal¦68616 life—I will bring them back to life on that final day¦68625.\wj*
\v 55 \wj For my flesh¦68628 is the true food, and¦68634 my blood¦68636 is the true drink¦68641.\wj*
\v 56 \wj Anyone who eats my flesh¦68680 and drinks¦68682 my blood¦68686 lives in me, and I will live in him¦68692.\wj*
\v 57 \wj The father is alive and sent me here, and I am alive because of Him, so also the person who eats me will be alive because of me.\wj*
\v 58 \wj Unlike your ancestors¦68763 who ate that bread \+add from the sky\+add* and then died, anyone who eats this bread that came down from heaven¦68756 will live through to the next age.\wj*”
\s1 Many people find the teaching too difficult
\p
\v 59 Yeshua taught¦68788 all of this in the meeting¦68786 hall¦68786 there in Capernaum¦68790.
\rem /s1 Many Disciples Desert Jesus
\rem /s1 The Words of Eternal Life
\v 60 But even many of his¦68798 followers who heard¦68794 it said¦68800, “This is difficult teaching—it's too hard to take.”
\p
\v 61 But \nd Yeshua¦68820\nd* already knew inside that his¦68831 followers were grumbling¦68826 about¦68827 this and asked them, “\wj Do you¦68837 find this offensive¦68838?\wj*
\v 62 \wj What¦68848 if you were to see humanity's child ascending to where¦68851 he came from?\wj*
\v 63 \wj It's the spirit that is the source of life, not the body¦68861. The concepts that I've taught you are all spiritual and life-giving.\wj*
\v 64 \wj But there¦68880 are some here who don't¦68889 believe me.\wj*” Actually, \nd Yeshua¦68899\nd* had already known¦68892 from the beginning¦68896 just who would believe and¦68905 which person would betray him¦68913
\v 65 so he said¦68919, “\wj That's why I told you that no one can come¦68924 to me unless the father¦68936 has given¦68932 them to me.\wj*”
\p
\v 66 After this, many of his¦68946 followers went¦68947 back and no longer¦68952 accompanied him around.
\p
\v 67 So¦68959 \nd Yeshua¦68961\nd* said¦68957 to his twelve¦68963 \add apprentices\add*, “\wj Don't you want to leave as well?\wj*”
\p
\v 68 \x + \xo 6:68-69: \xt Mat 16:16; Mrk 8:29; Luk 9:20.\x*“\nd Master¦68976\nd*,” Simon¦68974 answered¦68969, “if we went, who would we follow then? You're the \add only\add* one who teaches about living forever.
\v 69 We believe¦68986 and¦68987 know that you¦68991 are the holy son of \nd God¦68999\nd*.”
\p
\v 70 \nd Yeshua¦69005\nd* responded, “\wj Didn't I choose all twelve¦69016 of you myself? And yet one of you is a devil¦69024.\wj*”
\v 71 (He was talking¦69026 about Yudas¦69029, Simon¦69030 Iscariot's son, because¦69037 he was the one who would go on to betray him.)

\p
\v 1 After all this, \nd Yeshua¦69055\nd* travelled around Galilee¦69060. (He didn't¦69061 want to travel around Yudea¦69068 because¦69062 the leaders there wanted to execute him¦69072.)
\v 2 \x + \xo 7:2: \xt Lev 23:34; Deu 16:13.\x*As it¦69076 was now getting close to the Jewish Feast With Tents,
\v 3 his¦69093 brothers¦69092 said¦69086 to him, “You should leave this place and go down to Yudea¦69103 so that all your¦69108 followers can see the miracles that you're¦69118 doing¦69118.
\v 4 If you want to become well-known, you don't do things out of the main stream. If you want to do miracles, \add go and\add* show yourself¦69139 to the wider world¦69141.
\v 5 (You see, not even Yeshua's own \add half-\add*brothers believed¦69148 \add that he came from God\add*.)
\p
\v 6 So¦69154 \nd Yeshua¦69157\nd* responded, “\wj Well, you guys can do that any time, but it's not the right time for me yet.\wj*
\v 7 \wj All the people won't¦69175 hate you¦69182 guys, but¦69184 they do hate me because¦69186 I teach about the evil¦69196 things they are doing.\wj*
\v 8 \wj You all go¦69199 on down to Yerushalem ahead of me. I'm not going¦69208 to the feast yet because¦69213 it's not yet the right time¦69218 for me.\wj*”
\v 9 After saying this, Yeshua stayed up in Galilee¦69233.
\s1 Yeshua starts teaching about authentic justice

\p
\v 10 But after his¦69240 \add half-\add*brothers had left to go down to Yerushalem, Yeshua also went—not in the public limelight but¦69236 just incognito so to speak.
\v 11 However at the celebrations, the Jewish religious leaders were searching for him, and were asking around where he was.
\p
\v 12 Even among¦69278 the crowds¦69281 there¦69276 was a lot of quiet banter with some saying that Yeshua is a good man and others¦69290 complaining that he was misleading the people.
\v 13 Either way, no one was speaking¦69302 out in public¦69301 about him¦69305, because¦69307 they were afraid of the reaction of the religious leaders.
\rem /s1 Jesus Teaches at the Feast
\p
\v 14 Finally sometime in the middle¦69316 of the celebrations, \nd Yeshua¦69321\nd* went¦69318 into the temple¦69324 and¦69325 started teaching¦69326 in there.
\v 15 Even the Jewish leaders were surprised, asking, “How can this man know so much when he hasn't been trained as a teacher?”
\p
\v 16 \nd Yeshua¦69343\nd* himself responded¦69345, “\wj My teaching¦69348 doesn't come from me, but¦69352 from the one who sent¦69354 me.\wj*
\v 17 \wj If anyone¦69357 wants to do God's will, they'll soon figure out whether¦69368 my teaching¦69367 comes from God or if I'm just making it¦69373 up myself¦69377.\wj*
\v 18 \wj Any person who just teaches their own thoughts is just seeking their own advancement, but¦69390 anyone who wants to promote the one who sent¦69395 them, this is authentic and¦69400 there's no hidden self-interest.\wj*
\v 19 \wj Didn't Mosheh write down God's commandments for you, yet not a single one of you obeys them. Why are you wanting to execute me?\wj*”
\p
\v 20 “You must be demon-possessed¦69430,” said some in the crowd¦69427, “Who would be wanting to execute you¦69433.”
\p
\v 21 \nd Yeshua¦69439\nd* responded¦69441, “\wj I did one miracle and you¦69449 were all amazed¦69449.\wj*
\v 22 \x + \xo 7:22: a \xt Lev 12:3; \xo b \xt Gen 17:10.\x*\wj Mosheh gave¦69454 you the commandment about circumcision (even though it actually came from before his time), but to obey this, you'll even circumcise a baby boy on the Rest Day.\wj*

\v 24 \wj Don't just ‘judge’ things so that you yourselves look good, but¦69507 judge impartially, seeking the best for others.\wj*”

\p
\v 25 After this, some of the locals from Yerushalem started asking, “Isn't this the man they¦69523 were wanting to execute?
\v 26 Well, here he is teaching in public¦69527, yet they're not even confronting him. Perhaps¦69535 the leaders know that he really is the \nd messiah¦69547\nd*?
\v 27 But we¦69550 even know where this man is from. Surely when the \nd messiah¦69556\nd* comes, no one would know his family background.”
\p
\v 28 So¦69575 as \nd Yeshua¦69585\nd* continued teaching¦69583, he called out, “\wj Indeed you all know me and my home and my family. But I didn't¦69600 come¦69601 here of my own accord, but the one who sent¦69607 me here is truthful, even though you don't¦69600 even know him.\wj*
\v 29 \wj I know him, because¦69617 I came from him, indeed, he was the one who sent¦69624 me here.\wj*”
\p
\v 30 So¦69629 now they really want to arrest¦69631 him, but no one touched him because¦69643 it was not yet the proper time.
\v 31 Many in the crowd¦69657 did believe¦69660 that he was from God and they were saying¦69664, “When the \nd messiah¦69668\nd* comes, would he be doing¦69677 greater miracles than what we've seen this man¦69679 do?”

\v 33 So¦69709 \nd Yeshua¦69713\nd* said¦69708, “\wj I'll only be with you¦69719 all for a short while longer and¦69721 then I'll be going¦69722 to the one who sent¦69725 me.\wj*

\p
\v 35 The leaders wondered, “Where¦69751 could he be going that we wouldn't be able to find him? Will he go and live with the Jews¦69748 living out there among the Greeks and start teaching¦69771 the Greeks?
\v 36 And what does he mean about looking¦69786 for¦69786 him and not being able to find him, and not being able to go where¦69793 he goes?”

\p
\v 14 \nd Yeshua¦70439\nd* responded¦70441, “\wj Even when I am testifying about¦70448 myself¦70449, my¦70456 testimony¦70455 is valid, because¦70459 I know where I came¦70462 from and where I'm going.\wj*
\v 15 \wj You all are judging according¦70477 to your earthly values. I'm not judging anyone¦70486.\wj*

\p
\v 22 This puzzled the Jewish teachers, “Surely¦70634 he's not going to commit suicide! What else could he mean about ‘you can't¦70634 go where I'm going to be going’?”
\p
\v 23 Yeshua explained, “\wj All of you¦70664 are from the world below¦70656, but I'm from the world above¦70662. You all are part of this world, but I'm not part of it.\wj*
\v 24 \wj That's why I said that you'll be dying in your sins, because¦70689 if you refuse to believe¦70691 that I am \+add God\+add*, you will indeed all be dying in your sins.\wj*”
\p
\v 25 “So¦70705 who are you?” they asked.

\v 26 \wj I have a lot that I need to tell you¦70730 all and to judge many of your actions, because the one who sent¦70737 me is true, and it's what I hear from him¦70747 that I speak to all people.\wj*”
\p
\v 27 (They didn't¦70755 realise that he was talking¦70762 to them about¦70758 the father¦70759 \add in heaven\add*.)
\v 28 So¦70767 \nd Yeshua¦70771\nd* told them, “\wj When you all lift up\f + \fr 8:28 \ft lifted up / exalted: There's a play on words here.

\v 1 As Yeshua was walking along, he¦71497 saw¦71497 a man¦71498 who had been blind¦71499 from birth¦71501
\v 2 and his followers asked¦71504 him, “Honoured teacher, why was this man¦71513 born blind¦71520? Was it because he himself sinned¦71512, or his parents¦71517?”
\p
\v 3 \nd Yeshua¦71525\nd* answered¦71523, “\wj It wasn't either this man¦71527 or his¦71532 parents¦71531 that sinned¦71528.\f + \fr 9:3 \ft We just want to alert our readers here that we have divided the Greek sentences here in a way that's different from the long-standing tradition.

\v 13 Then they brought the man¦71742 who had been blind¦71742 to the Pharisees.
\v 14 Now, it¦71743 had been the Rest Day when \nd Yeshua¦71755\nd* had made the slurry and¦71756 enabled him¦71760 to see,
\v 15 and because of this, some in the Pharisee¦71770 party¦71770 asked him how it was that now he could see. And he answered, “Well, he put a slurry on my¦71781 eyes¦71785 and when I washed¦71788 them, I could see.”
\p
\v 16 “Well clearly that man is not from \nd God¦71806\nd*,” some of them said, “because¦71809 he doesn't respect the Rest Day.”
\p However others said, “But¦71826 if he's just a sinner, how could he do miracles like that?”
\p
\v 17 So¦71834 they asked the man who had been blind¦71837, “Well, what do \em you\em* have to say because¦71848 it was your¦71851 eyes¦71853 that he opened¦71849?”
\p “He must be a prophet¦71858,” the man said.
\p
\v 18 But some of the Jews¦71864 weren't even sure that he really had been blind¦71870 before and could now see, so they called¦71876 for his¦71881 parents¦71880
\v 19 and asked¦71886 them, “You two say that this is your¦71896 son and that he was born blind¦71901. If so, how come that now he can see?”
\p
\v 20 His¦71916 parents¦71915 answered¦71910, “We know that he's our¦71926 son, and we know that he was born blind¦71929.

\v 23 so that's why they had said¦71994, “He's old enough—just ask¦72001 him.”)
\p

\p
\v 25 “Well, I don't¦72042 know whether or not he's a sinner¦72040,” replied the man. “All I know is that I used to be blind¦72048 but now I can see.”

\v 26 “What did he do to you?” they asked again. “How did he open your¦72068 eyes¦72070?”
\p

\v 9 \wj \+em I am\+em* the entrance. Anyone who comes in via me will be saved¦72566, and will be able to go in and out and find pasture¦72572.\wj*
\v 10 \wj The thief¦72576 only comes to steal¦72584 and kill¦72588 and destroy¦72588, but I came¦72591 so that they could live, and live a full life¦72593.\wj*
\p
\v 11 “\wj \+em I am\+em* the good shepherd—the good shepherd gives his¦72613 own life¦72612 for the sheep¦72618.\wj*\f + \fr 10:11 \ft See http://bibleandtech.blogspot.com/2021/04/john-1011-18-translations-and-notes-rcl.html\f*
\v 12 \wj The paid worker is not even the shepherd¦72626, because the sheep aren't¦72624 his own and if he sees a wolf coming¦72640 he just abandons the sheep and takes off and the wolf scatters¦72653 the sheep and snatches¦72650 some—\wj*
\v 13 \wj that's because¦72660 he's just a worker and doesn't really care about¦72669 the sheep¦72671.\wj*

\v 16 \wj I also have other sheep which¦72720 are not in this field¦72726 and it's appropriate¦72730 for me to bring¦72733 those¦72728 other sheep also, then they'll be hearing¦72738 my¦72737 voice¦72736 because there'll be just one flock¦72744 with one shepherd¦72746.\wj*
\p
\v 17 \wj The father¦72751 loves me because¦72754 I am laying¦72756 down my¦72759 life¦72758 so that I can take¦72762 it¦72763 back again¦72761.\wj*
\v 18 \wj No one is taking it from me, but I'm laying¦72773 it down myself¦72776. I have authority to lay it down, and also authority to take it back again¦72786 because I received¦72793 this command¦72792 from my¦72799 father¦72798.\wj*”
\p
\v 19 The Jewish religious leaders were again¦72802 divided about Yeshua's teaching
\v 20 with many of them saying¦72811, “He's got a demon¦72819,” and, “He's stark raving¦72822 mad—why are you¦72826 all even listening to him¦72825!”
\p
\v 21 But others were saying¦72830, “He doesn't sound like he's demon-possessed. And how could a demon make a blind¦72844 man see?”

\p
\v 22 By then it was winter¦72859 and the time for the Jewish Festival of Dedication in Yerushalem¦72857.
\v 23 \nd Yeshua¦72866\nd* was walking¦72863 in the temple¦72869 in an area known as Solomon's¦72874 Porch
\v 24 when he was surrounded¦72877 by the Jewish religious leaders and interrogated, “How long do you plan to keep us in suspense¦72892 for? If you are the \nd messiah¦72897\nd*, just tell us clearly.”
\p
\v 25 “\wj I already told you all,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦72906\nd* answered¦72903, “\wj but you didn't¦72911 believe¦72912 me. The miracles that I do with the authority of my¦72926 father¦72925 testify¦72931 about me,\wj*
\v 26 \wj but you don't¦72937 accept what the miracles point to because¦72939 you aren't¦72937 part of my flock.\wj*
\v 27 \wj My¦72958 sheep¦72953 listen to my¦72958 voice¦72957, and I know them and they¦72966 follow¦72966 after¦72967 me.\wj*

\v 30 \wj The father¦73023 and¦73021 I are one.\wj*”
\p
\v 31 Again the Jewish leaders picked up rocks¦73030 to throw at him to kill him
\v 32 but \nd Yeshua¦73040\nd* asked them, “\wj I showed¦73045 you all many miracles from my¦73052 father¦73051. Which miracle do you want to kill me for?\wj*”
\p
\v 33 \x + \xo 10:33: \xt Lev 24:16.\x*They answered¦73063, “It's not for any \em good¦73070\em* deed that we think you deserve to die, but because¦73079 you, a human¦73081, dishonour \nd God¦73086\nd* by claiming to be him¦73065.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 10:34: \xt Psa 82:6.\x*\nd Yeshua¦73090\nd* answered¦73087, “\wj Isn't it¦73095 written¦73096 in your¦73104 scriptures that God said¦73107, ‘You all are gods¦73109’?\wj*
\v 35 \wj Now the scriptures¦73128 can't¦73124 be wrong, and¦73123 if the ones who heard teaching from \+nd God¦73121\+nd* were called¦73113 gods¦73114,\wj*
\v 36 \wj why are you¦73138 telling the one that the father¦73131 blessed and¦73133 sent¦73134 out into the world¦73137 that I am insulting¦73141 God because¦73142 I said¦73143 that I'm God's son?\wj*
\v 37 \wj If I'm not doing¦73152 my¦73157 father's¦73156 work, then you don't¦73151 need to believe¦73159 that he sent me,\wj*

\p
\v 39 That was enough that they tried yet again¦73201 to arrest¦73202 him, but he was able to get out and away from their¦73208 influence.
\p
\v 40 \x + \xo 10:40: \xt Yhn 1:28.\x*Then¦73209 Yeshua crossed the Yordan¦73215 river to the place¦73218 where¦73220 Yohan¦73222 had immersed¦73226 the people, and he stayed there¦73230.
\v 41 Many people visited him there, and they were saying¦73237 that even though Yohan¦73239 had never done even one miracle, on the other¦73248 hand everything that he had said about Yeshua was true,
\v 42 and many people there¦73265 believed¦73261 that Yeshua was from God.
\c 11
\s1 Yeshua is aware of Lazarus' death from afar
\rem /s1 The Death of Lazarus
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 11:1: \xt Luk 10:38-39.\x*Now there was a man¦73268 called Lazarus¦73271 who lived in the village¦73276 of Bethany¦73273 along with his sisters¦73284 Martha¦73281 and¦73279 Maria¦73278.
\v 2 \x + \xo 11:2: \xt Yhn 12:3.\x*(Maria¦73292 was the one who \jmp later|link-href="#C12V3"\jmp* poured fragrant oil over Yeshua¦73311 and¦73298 wiped¦73299 his¦73302 feet¦73301 with her¦73305 hair¦73304.) But¦73288 now their brother¦73309 was seriously ill
\v 3 and so the two sisters¦73321 sent¦73315 a message to Yeshua saying¦73328, “\nd Master¦73330\nd*, this man that you¦73333 love is seriously ill.”
\p
\v 4 However, when \nd Yeshua¦73338\nd* got the message he said¦73339 \add to those around him\add*, “\wj This sickness¦73342 won't¦73344 end in death¦73347 but¦73336 in honour for \+nd God¦73353\+nd*, so that his son will also be honoured because of it.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 Now it was true that \nd Yeshua¦73368\nd* loved the three of them.
\v 6 Yet when he heard¦73384 that Lazarus was sick, he stayed in the place¦73397 where he was for two¦73398 more days¦73399
\v 7 before he said to his followers, “\wj It's time to head down to Yudea¦73412 again¦73414.\wj*”
\p
\v 8 But they double-checked, “Honoured teacher, the Yudeans wanted to execute you, so do you really want to go back there¦73430 again¦73428?”
\p
\v 9 And \nd Yeshua¦73433\nd* answered¦73431, “\wj There are twelve hours¦73437 of light in the day. Anyone who walks during the daytime doesn't stumble¦73453 because¦73454 he is seeing¦73461 the light \+add that shines in\+add* this world¦73458.\wj*
\v 10 \wj But anyone¦73464 who walks at night¦73468 will stumble¦73469, because¦73470 the light¦73472 is not in them.\wj*”
\v 11 And he continued, “\wj Our¦73489 friend¦73488 Lazarus¦73485 has fallen¦73490 asleep¦73490, but I'm going¦73493 so that I can wake him up.\wj*”
\p
\v 12 But his followers objected, “\nd Master¦73507\nd*, \add it's good\add* if he's sleeping because it helps with healing.”
\p
\v 13 But \nd Yeshua¦73516\nd* had spoken¦73513 about Lazarus' death¦73520—not just normal sleep as they had thought.
\v 14 So¦73534 \nd Yeshua¦73539\nd* told them plainly¦73540, “\wj Lazarus¦73541 is dead\wj*
\v 15 \wj and I'm glad that I wasn't there¦73555, because¦73548 you all will benefit as your¦73548 faith grows. Anyway, let's get moving.\wj*”
\p
\v 16 Thomas¦73562 (nicknamed ‘Twin’) grumbled to the others, “Yeah, we might as well go so that we can get killed as well.”

\p
\v 17 So¦73578 when they eventually arrived, \nd Lazarus¦73580\nd* body had already¦73589 been in the burial chamber for four¦73588 days¦73590.
\v 18 The village of Bethany¦73600 was less than three kilometres from Yerushalem¦73603,
\v 19 so many of the Yudeans from there had come¦73616 out to console¦73626 Martha¦73621 and¦73622 Maria¦73624 after the death of their¦73629 brother¦73630.
\p
\v 20 As soon as Martha¦73634 heard¦73636 that \nd Yeshua¦73639\nd* had arrived, she went out to meet him, but¦73645 Maria¦73643 stayed behind where she was sitting¦73651 in the house¦73648.
\v 21 Martha¦73656 cried, “\nd Yeshua¦73659\nd*, \nd master¦73661\nd*. If you'd been here, my¦73671 brother¦73670 wouldn't¦73667 have died¦73668,
\v 22 because I already know that anything that you ask from \nd God¦73688\nd*, he will give it to you.”
\p
\v 23 \nd Yeshua¦73696\nd* responded, “\wj Your¦73701 brother¦73700 will come back to life.\wj*”
\p
\v 24 “Yes, I know that he'll come back to life at the resurrection¦73712 on the last day¦73716,” said Martha¦73705.
\p
\v 25 But \nd Yeshua¦73722\nd* continued, “\wj \+em I am\+em* the resurrection¦73726 and¦73727 the life¦73729. Anyone who believes¦73731 that I'm from God, even if they die¦73735 they'll still be living¦73736,\wj*
\v 26 \wj and everyone¦73739 who's alive and believes that I was sent from God, will not die¦73748 in the \+add next\+add* age.\wj*”
\p
\v 27 Martha replied, “Yes, \nd master¦73759\nd*, I do believe¦73762 that you're¦73765 the \nd messiah¦73768\nd*, God's son, the one sent into this world¦73776.”
\s1 Yeshua weeps with his close friends
\rem /s1 Jesus Weeps
\p
\v 28 After saying this, Martha went¦73783 and quietly called¦73785 her¦73789 sister¦73788 Maria¦73786, “The teacher¦73797 is on his way and he wants to see you.”
\v 29 So¦73804 Maria quickly¦73809 got up and¦73810 went to find him¦73814.
\v 30 At that stage, \nd Yeshua¦73821\nd* hadn't yet come¦73819 into the village¦73825 proper, but¦73826 was still¦73828 at the edge where¦73833 Martha¦73837 had met him¦73835.
\v 31 The Yudean people who'd been sitting with Maria¦73853 in sympathy there in the house¦73847, when they saw her get up quickly¦73856 and go out, they assumed that she was going¦73869 to the cemetery to weep there.
\p
\v 32 But when Maria¦73880 found \nd Yeshua¦73886\nd*, she¦73882 knelt at his¦73893 feet¦73897 and said, “\nd Master¦73901\nd*, if you'd been here my¦73909 brother¦73912 wouldn't have died¦73910.”
\p
\v 33 Now when \nd Yeshua¦73914\nd* saw¦73917 her weeping there, along with the others that had followed also weeping, he himself¦73943 was quite affected and groaned¦73934 inside,
\v 34 but he just asked, “\wj Where¦73946 has he been laid?\wj*”
\p “\nd Master¦73952\nd*, come and see¦73955,” they replied.
\p
\v 35 Then \nd Yeshua¦73959\nd* \add broke down and\add* burst into tears,
\v 36 which made the others comment, “See¦73965 how much he cared about him.”
\p
\v 37 But some of them mocked, “This is the man who could make a blind¦73987 man see again, yet how come he wasn't able to stop this man from dying!”

\p
\v 38 So¦73995 \nd Yeshua¦73994\nd* who was still holding back sobs, went to the cemetery. Lazarus' body had been placed in a cave with a stone¦74012 blocking it,
\v 39 and \nd Yeshua¦74018\nd* instructed them to take away the stone¦74021.
\p Martha¦74031 (the sister¦74027 of the dead man) spoke up, “\nd Master¦74032\nd*, the stink¦74034 will be bad because¦74036 it's already¦74033 been four days.”
\p
\v 40 But \nd Yeshua¦74041\nd* responded¦74043, “\wj Didn't I tell you that if you would believe¦74047, then you would see God's power?\wj*”
\v 41 So¦74056 they took¦74055 the stone¦74059 away and \nd Yeshua¦74068\nd* looked upwards¦74073 and said¦74075, “Father, I thank¦74077 you that you listen to me.
\v 42 Actually I know that you always¦74086 hear¦74088 me, but I said¦74095 that for the sake of these people so that they will believe¦74097 that it¦74095 was you who sent¦74101 me here.”
\v 43 After saying that, he¦74107 shouted, “\wj Lazarus¦74110, come¦74112 out!\wj*”
\v 44 Then the man who had died¦74118 \add slowly\add* shuffled out—still with linen¦74129 strips¦74129 wrapped around his hands¦74127 and his feet¦74122, and a cloth wrapped around his face¦74132.

\p
\v 45 Because of that, many of the Yudeans believed¦74171 that Yeshua was from God after having followed Maria¦74161 and¦74162 seeing what Yeshua did.
\v 46 But others went¦74178 and¦74183 told the Pharisee¦74182 party¦74182 what \nd Yeshua¦74193\nd* had done.
\v 47 So¦74195 the chief¦74197 priests¦74197 and the Pharisee¦74200 party¦74200 called a formal meeting and asked, “What should we¦74206 do because¦74208 this man¦74211 is doing many miracles.
\v 48 If we allow¦74219 him to continue like this, all the crowds will be believing¦74223 he's the messiah, and then the Romans will come and destroy both our temple and our governance.”
\p
\v 49 But one of them, Caiaphas¦74250 who was chief¦74252 priest¦74252 that year¦74255, spoke up, “You don't¦74260 know anything.
\v 50 Don't you all realise that its better for all of us if one man¦74272 dies so that the people¦74276 and the nation¦74281 won't¦74278 be destroyed?”
\v 51 (He didn't¦74287 say this from his own thinking, but being¦74292 chief¦74291 priest¦74291 that year¦74294, he was announcing God's message that \nd Yeshua¦74303\nd* was going¦74301 to die for the nation¦74308,
\v 52 and¦74309 not only for this nation¦74313, but¦74315 for all of God's children¦74319 scattered¦74324 around the world to become united.)
\p
\v 53 As a result, from that day¦74334 on they decided that Yeshua needed to be executed.
\v 54 Because of that, \nd Yeshua¦74344\nd* no longer¦74345 walked around Yudea in public¦74346, but¦74351 went¦74352 out to the town of Ephraim¦74362 out in the wilderness¦74360 and¦74365 stayed there¦74342 with his followers.

\v 55 At that time, the Jewish Passover celebrations were approaching, and¦74383 many people from the regions¦74392 went¦74384 to Yerushalem¦74388 ahead of the celebrations to purify¦74400 themselves¦74401.
\v 56 They were looking¦74402 out for \nd Yeshua¦74406\nd* and as they stood¦74415 around in the temple¦74414, they asked each other, “What do you think? Surely he won't¦74423 come¦74424 to the celebrations.”
\v 57 The chief¦74433 priests¦74433 and the Pharisee¦74436 party¦74436 had already announced that if anyone¦74443 knew where¦74446 Yeshua was, they must inform them so that they could arrest¦74451 him¦74452.

\v 1 Because of this, \nd Yeshua¦74455\nd* went¦74462 to Bethany¦74464 six days¦74459 before¦74456 the Passover. This was where¦74465 Lazarus¦74467 lived, the one he had brought back to life.
\v 2 So¦74480 they prepared dinner for him there¦74483 and Martha¦74486 was serving¦74487 and Lazarus¦74492 was among those sitting¦74497 with Yeshua.
\v 3 \x + \xo 12:3: \xt Luk 7:37-38.\x*Then Maria¦74503 took about 300g of very expensive nard oil and smeared it on \nd Yeshua's¦74518\nd* feet, and then wiped¦74520 off his¦74526 feet with her¦74523 own hair¦74522, and the house¦74530 was filled¦74531 with the fragrance of the oil.
\v 4 But Yudas¦74542, one of Yeshua's apprentices¦74548 (the one who would eventually turn him in) complained,
\v 5 “How come this lotion wasn't sold for almost a year's wages and¦74572 then the money given¦74573 to the poor?”
\v 6 But he didn't¦74581 say this because he cared for poor people, but¦74578 because he carried the purse for the group and used to steal from it.

\v 16 (\nd Yeshua's¦74788\nd* apprentices didn't¦74775 realise all these things at the time, but it was later after Yeshua was lifted up to heaven that they were reminded¦74790 that these things had been written¦74801 about him, and that they had \add indeed\add* happened to him.)

\v 18 So because of this, others also wanted to met Yeshua because they'd heard¦74839 that he'd done that miracle.
\v 19 So¦74848 the Pharisees discussed this together, “We're getting nowhere with this. Look, it seems like the whole world¦74863 wants to follow him¦74866.”

\v 28 \wj Father, may your¦75050 authority be honoured.\wj*”
\p And a voice¦75069 from the sky answered, “I've already brought honour¦75048 to it and will do so again¦75077.”
\p
\v 29 This caused some in the crowd¦75082 standing there to say that they'd heard¦75087 thunder¦75091 while others said that a messenger¦75099 must have spoken¦75101 to Yeshua.
\p
\v 30 “\wj That voice¦75114 wasn't for my¦75110 sake,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦75108\nd* responded¦75107, “\wj but¦75118 for all of you¦75120.\wj*

\p
\v 35 \nd Yeshua¦75204\nd* answered them, “\wj The light will be among you all for just a little¦75206 bit longer, so get walking while¦75217 you have the light so that you won't¦75223 have to deal with darkness. Anyone walking in the dark doesn't know where¦75238 they're going¦75239.\wj*

\p \nd Yeshua¦75257\nd* said these¦75254 things and then after leaving them, he was hidden¦75262 from them.
\s1 Many people refuse to stand for Yeshua
\p
\v 37 Even though Yeshua had done so many miracles in front of the people, they¦75274 didn't¦75273 believe¦75274 that he was the messiah.
\v 38 \x + \xo 12:38: \xt Isa 53:1 (LXX).\x*This fulfilled¦75284 what the prophet¦75283 Isayah¦75281 wrote,

\q1 And who was the master's power revealed¦75298 to?”
\p
\v 39 Because¦75299 of this, they¦75302 weren't able to believe¦75304, and again¦75308 as Isayah¦75310 wrote,

\p
\v 41 Isayah¦75345 wrote this because¦75346 he saw¦75349 the messiah's greatness and spoke¦75356 concerning¦75357 him.
\v 42 Likewise¦75359, many of the Jewish leaders believed¦75367 that Yeshua was the messiah, but they didn't tell others because¦75371 they didn't want the Pharisee¦75373 party¦75373 to banish them from their services

\v 1 Even before¦75546 the actual feast part of the Passover celebrations, \nd Yeshua¦75554\nd* knew that his time had come—the time when he would leave this world and \add return\add* to the father¦75572. He loved his followers who were in the world right through to the end¦75582.
\p
\v 2 And now it was getting near time for the dinner and the devil¦75591 had already¦75592 put into Yudas¦75601 Iscariot's mind¦75596 \add the idea\add* of handing Yeshua over \add to the authorities\add*.
\v 3 Yeshua knew that the father¦75623 had given¦75619 everything to him, putting it under his control, and he knew that he had come from God and would return to God.
\v 4 So he got up from the dinner \add table\add*, changed out of his clothes¦75647, and wrapped a linen¦75651 towel¦75651 around himself¦75654.
\v 5 Then he put water¦75658 into the wash bowl and started washing¦75667 the feet¦75669 of his apprentices¦75671, wiping¦75674 them dry with the linen¦75676 towel¦75676 that he was wearing wrapped around him.
\v 6 After he'd washed a few, he got to Simon¦75684 Peter¦75685 who asked him, “\nd Master¦75691\nd*, are you going to wash my¦75693 feet¦75696?”
\p
\v 7 “\wj What I'm doing¦75705 now,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦75698\nd* answered¦75697, “\wj you won't¦75708 really understand, but in the future you will.\wj*”

\p
\v 9 “Well, if that's so,” Peter¦75752 said, “don't¦75755 just wash my feet¦75758 but¦75761 my hands¦75764 and¦75765 my head as well.”
\p
\v 10 \nd Yeshua¦75771\nd* responded, “\wj Any person who's already washed¦75773 \+add themselves\+add* only needs to wash their feet¦75785 now to be clean. And so you're clean, but not every one of you.\wj*”
\v 11 He said¦75809 this last bit because¦75807 he already knew who was going to hand him over.
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 13:12-15: \xt Luk 22:27.\x*So¦75816 when he'd finished washing their¦75820 feet¦75819, he got dressed again¦75831 and sat¦75830 down and asked, “\wj Do you know what I just did to you all?\wj*

\v 22 This made his apprentices¦76019 glance around at each other, puzzled about which one he was talking¦76025 about.

\v 24 So¦76046 Simon¦76048 Peter¦76049 nodded to him to find out who Yeshua had been talking¦76067 about¦76065,
\v 25 and he leaned¦76070 back on \nd Yeshua¦76079\nd* and asked \add quietly\add*, “\nd Master¦76082\nd*, who is it?”
\p
\v 26 “\wj It's the one I hand this piece of bread to after I've dipped it \+add in the sauce\+add*,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦76089\nd* answered¦76085. Then¦76104 after dipping his piece of bread in, he gave it to Yudas¦76115 Iscariot¦76119.
\v 27 After \add Yudas accepted\add* the piece¦76124 of bread¦76124, Satan¦76130 entered into him, and then \nd Yeshua¦76136\nd* told him¦76134, “What you're¦76138 about to do, do it soon.”
\v 28 But¦76143 none of the others sitting¦76148 around the table knew¦76145 what Yeshua meant.
\v 29 Some of them thought that since Yudas¦76165 held their purse, perhaps \nd Yeshua¦76170\nd* was getting him¦76168 to buy something they needed for the feast¦76179 or to give¦76185 something to the poor.

\v 16 while Peter waited outside¦79375 at the door. Then the other¦79381 intern who was known¦79385 to the chief¦79390 priest¦79390 went¦79376 back and spoke¦79392 to the woman at the door and brought¦79398 Peter in too.
\v 17 But the servant¦79409 girl¦79409 who was watching the door challenged Peter¦79414, “Aren't you also one of the followers of that man¦79423?”
\p “No, I'm not,” he responded.
\p
\v 18 Meanwhile the servants and attendants¦79436 had made a fire¦79437 and were standing around it¦79441 warming themselves¦79443, and Peter¦79450 also went and stood there to warm himself¦79455.

\p
\v 19 Now the chief¦79458 priest¦79458 interrogated \nd Yeshua¦79461\nd* about his followers and¦79466 about his teaching¦79469.
\v 20 \nd Yeshua¦79475\nd* answered¦79472 him¦79473, “I've spoken¦79480 openly to the people. I always¦79484 taught¦79485 in the meeting halls and in the temple¦79492 where¦79493 Jewish people meet. I didn't speak in secret¦79501
\v 21 so why are you¦79506 asking¦79506 \em me\em*? Ask the people who heard¦79511 what I told them—they're the ones who know what I said¦79519.”
\p
\v 22 When he said that, one of the attendants¦79529 standing there slapped \nd Yeshua¦79534\nd* \add on the face\add* and said, “You think you can answer¦79537 the chief¦79539 priest¦79539 like that?”
\p
\v 23 But \nd Yeshua¦79544\nd* responded, “If I said anything wrong¦79548, tell me my error. But if it was true, why are you¦79560 hitting me?”
\p
\v 24 So¦79563 Annas¦79566 sent¦79561 him¦79564 away, still tied up, to Caiaphas¦79569 the chief¦79571 priest¦79571.

\p
\v 28 Then¦79647 they led \nd Yeshua¦79636\nd* out from Caiaphas' place and towards the residence of the governor. It was now the early¦79646 hours of the morning and as Jews, they didn't¦79649 enter the residence of the Roman governor so they wouldn't become defiled¦79656 and thus unable to eat¦79659 the Passover meal.
\v 29 So¦79663 Governor Pilate¦79667 came¦79662 outside¦79668 to them and¦79672 asked, “What charge are you¦79677 all bringing¦79677 against¦79678 this man¦79680?”
\p
\v 30 “We wouldn't¦79697 have brought him to you if he hadn't committed a serious crime,” they answered¦79682.
\p
\v 31 So¦79704 Pilate¦79707 said, “You just take him and judge¦79717 him yourselves according¦79713 to your¦79716 own laws.”
\p But the Jewish leaders responded¦79703, “We don't¦79726 have permission¦79727 to execute anyone¦79729.”
\v 32 (This happened to fulfil¦79736 what \nd Yeshua¦79735\nd* had said\x + \xo 18:32: \xt Yhn 3:14; 12:32.\x* about the way that he was going¦79744 to die.)
\p
\v 33 So Pilate¦79755 went¦79747 back into his governor's¦79752 residence¦79752 and called¦79757 for \nd Yeshua¦79759\nd* and asked him¦79762, “So you're the king¦79767 of the Jews¦79769?”
\p
\v 34 “\wj Are you saying¦79781 this yourself¦79777,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦79775\nd* asked, “\wj or did others¦79784 say it¦79786 about me?\wj*”
\p
\v 35 Pilate¦79793 retorted, “Hoy! I'm not a Jew¦79798. It was your own people and the chief¦79807 priests¦79807 that handed you over to me. What have you done?”
\p
\v 36 “\wj My kingdom isn't in this world,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦79816\nd* answered¦79814, “\wj because if it was, my supporters would have fought so that I wouldn't have been handed over to the Jewish leaders. But no, my kingdom isn't from here.\wj*”
\p
\v 37 “So¦79865 you \em are\em* a king then?” Pilate¦79868 responded¦79864.
\p “\wj You're saying¦79880 that I'm a king,\wj*” said \nd Yeshua¦79876\nd*, “\wj and indeed I was born to be a king. I came into the world¦79897 so that I could testify¦79899 to the truth.\wj*”

\v 39 But you all have a custom¦79946 here that the governor can release one prisoner during the Passover. So would you like me to release the king¦79964 of the Jews¦79966?”

\c 19

\p
\v 1 So¦79983 Pilate¦79987 took¦79984 \nd Yeshua¦79990\nd* and¦79991 had him flogged¦79992.
\v 2 Then¦79993 the soldiers¦79995 twisted¦79996 some thorn¦79999 branches together¦79996 into a crown¦79997 and put it¦80001 on Yeshua's head, and they dressed him in a \add royal\add* purple¦80011 robe¦80010.
\v 3 They came up to him and said, “Greetings¦80020, you king¦80022 of the Jews¦80025,” and then slapped him.
\p
\v 4 Then¦80031 Pilate¦80037 went¦80032 back outside¦80035 and said to the Jews, “Look¦80042 here. I'm bringing¦80043 him out to you so that you all can know¦80048 that I didn't¦80059 find him guilty¦80056 of anything.”
\v 5 So¦80065 they led \nd Yeshua¦80067\nd* out wearing¦80069 the thorny¦80072 crown¦80073 and the kingly robe¦80077, and Pilate said, “Look¦80081. Here's the man¦80084.”
\p
\v 6 Now when the chief¦80090 priests¦80090 and their supporters saw¦80087 him, they yelled¦80096 out, “Execute him on a stake! Execute him on a stake!”
\p “Well you take him and execute¦80111 him on a stake,” Pilate¦80105 answered, “because¦80113 I haven't found anything that he's guilty¦80119 of.”
\p
\v 7 The Jews¦80123 responded, “We have a law and he should be executed according¦80128 to that law because¦80134 he said he was the son of \nd God¦80138\nd*.”
\p
\v 8 Now when Pilate¦80146 heard¦80144 that, he became more afraid¦80152.
\v 9 So¦80153 he went¦80154 back inside the residence¦80157 and asked Yeshua, “Where do you come from?”
\p But¦80153 Yeshua didn't¦80171 answer¦80170 him.
\v 10 So¦80175 Pilate¦80178 said, “Why don't¦80180 you answer me? Don't you realise that I have the authority to release you and I also have the authority to have you executed¦80193 on a stake¦80193?”
\p
\v 11 “\wj You have no authority¦80204 over me,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦80200\nd* answered¦80197, “\wj none at all, except¦80209 what has been granted to you from above¦80215. Because¦80216 of this, the sin¦80224 of the person who handed me over to you is greater¦80223.\wj*”
\p
\v 12 After hearing this, Pilate¦80230 wanted to release him but¦80236 the Jews¦80237 yelled¦80238 out, “If you release that man, you're¦80248 no friend of Caesar. Everyone¦80252 who claims to be a king is no friend of Caesar's.”
\p
\v 13 So¦80263 now Pilate, having¦80265 heard¦80265 all this, brought¦80272 \nd Yeshua¦80275\nd* outside¦80273 \add again\add*. Pilate sat¦80278 down on the judge's seat at a place¦80283 called The Stone¦80285 Pavement¦80285 (and¦80277 called Gabbatha¦80290 in Hebrew).
\v 14 It was now about¦80300 noon on the day¦80294 when the Passover meal is prepared¦80294, and Pilate said to the Jews¦80308, “Look¦80309. Here's your¦80312 king¦80311.”
\p
\v 15 They yelled¦80316 back, “Take him away. Take him away. Execute¦80321 him on a stake.”
\p Pilate¦80326 asked them, “You want me to have your¦80329 king executed¦80330 on a stake?”
\p “We don't¦80334 have any king other than Caesar¦80339,” the chief priests¦80333 answered¦80331.
\p
\v 16 So¦80341 Pilate gave¦80342 them his permission and handed \nd Yeshua¦80356\nd* over to them, and they took¦80350 him away to be executed¦80347 on a stake¦80347.

\v 17 Carrying the pole\f + \fr 19:17 \ft TD: The Greek word used here is used in other places to mean a stake such as used to make a fence. It's uncertain whether or not it had a horizontal cross-piece, although the Romans did use a range of methods.\f* himself¦80365, Yeshua arrived at the Place of the Skull (called Golgotha¦80381 in Hebrew) just out of the city
\v 18 where¦80382 they secured him to a stake along with two¦80389 others¦80388—one stake on each side and with \nd Yeshua¦80397\nd* on the middle¦80394 one.
\v 19 Pilate¦80403 wrote¦80398 out a title¦80401 and¦80404 put it¦80410 on the stake¦80409: \nd Yeshua¦80413\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦80415\nd*, the king¦80417 of the Jews¦80419.
\v 20 Many Jews¦80429 read this title¦80424 because¦80430 the place¦80434 where¦80439 \nd Yeshua¦80442\nd* was executed¦80440 was near the city¦80436, and it¦80444 had been written¦80445 in Hebrew, Latin¦80448, and Greek.
\v 21 But the Jewish chief¦80456 priests¦80456 complained to Pilate¦80454, “Don't write ‘The king of the Jews’, but rather ‘The one who \em said\em* he was king of the Jews’.”
\p
\v 22 However Pilate¦80476 answered¦80474, “What I've written, I've written.”
\p
\v 23 After the soldiers¦80482 had fastened \nd Yeshua¦80488\nd* to the stake¦80485, they took¦80489 his clothes¦80491 and placed them in four¦80495 piles, one for each of them. This left his robe, which had been woven¦80511 from top to bottom in one piece.
\v 24 So they said to each other, “Rather than tearing this, let's throw a dice to see who will get it.” (This fulfilled¦80532 what was written in the scriptures¦80531\x + \xo 19:24: \xt Psa 22:18.\x* that said: they divided¦80535 my garments among themselves¦80540 and threw¦80546 a dice for my clothes¦80538.) So they went ahead and did that.
\p
\v 25 Meanwhile a group of women had stayed standing near \nd Yeshua¦80560\nd* on the stake¦80558: his mother and his aunt, Maria the wife of Clopas¦80574, and Maria from Magdala¦80579.
\v 26 When \nd Yeshua¦80580\nd* saw his mother and also the intern that he loved standing nearby, he said to her, “\wj Look, he'll be your¦80602 son.\wj*”
\v 27 And to the intern he said, “\wj Look¦80607, she'll be your¦80611 mother¦80610.\wj*” And that intern took¦80618 her into his own \add home\add* from then on.

\v 32 So¦80725 the soldiers¦80727 came¦80723 and broke¦80732 the legs of the men on each side of Yeshua,

\v 38 After all of this, Yosef from Arimathea¦80831 went to Pilate. (Yosef was a follower of Yeshua, but secretly because¦80839 he was afraid of what the Jewish leaders might do.)

\v 2 So¦80982 she ran quickly and went to Simon¦80987 Peter¦80988 and the other¦80992 intern that \nd Yeshua¦80997\nd* loved, and told them, “They've taken the \nd master's¦81003\nd* body out of the tomb¦81006 and we don't¦81008 know where¦81010 they've put it.”

\v 5 Without going in, he stooped¦81051 down at the entrance and looked in and saw the linen¦81055 strips lying¦81053 there¦81053.
\v 6 But¦81066 Peter¦81067 came¦81071 along behind him¦81069 and went¦81071 straight into the tomb¦81074 and also saw the linen¦81078 strips lying¦81079 there¦81079.

\v 18 So Maria¦81324 went and told the trainees, “I've seen¦81334 the \nd master¦81337\nd*,” and she told them what he'd said¦81341.

\v 19 On Sunday evening¦81347 \nd Yeshua's¦81372\nd* trainees had met together and had the doors¦81358 locked because¦81365 they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, but Yeshua arrived and stood¦81374 in the middle of the room and said, “Peace¦81381 to you¦81382 all.”
\v 20 Then¦81383 he showed¦81387 them his hands¦81391 and his side and they were so happy now that they had seen¦81402 the \nd master¦81404\nd*.
\v 21 \nd Yeshua¦81409\nd* continued, “\wj Peace¦81412 to you all. Now I am sending¦81420 you all out just like the father¦81418 sent¦81415 me out.\wj*”
\v 22 Then¦81424 he breathed¦81427 on them and said¦81426, “\wj Receive¦81432 the holy \+nd spirit¦81433\+nd*.\wj*

\v 24 But Thomas¦81456, one of the twelve¦81461 (nicknamed ‘Twin’), wasn't with them when \nd Yeshua¦81473\nd* had come
\v 25 so the other¦81478 trainees told him, “We have seen¦81481 the \nd master¦81483\nd*.”
\p But he replied, “I won't¦81489 believe¦81545 that unless I see¦81490 the mark of the nails in his hands¦81496 and I can put my finger¦81519 into the marks and can put my hand¦81537 into \add the gash on\add* his side.”

\v 27 Yeshua came and stood in the middle of the room even though the doors were shut, and said, “\wj Peace to you all.\wj*”
\p
\v 28 Thomas spoke up, “My¦81618 \nd master¦81617\nd* and my¦81618 \nd god¦81621\nd*!”
\p
\v 29 “\wj So you believe now because you've seen me,\wj*” said \nd Yeshua¦81628\nd*. “\wj The ones who haven't seen me, but who believe anyway, will \+add certainly\+add* be rewarded.\wj*”

\p
\v 1 After¦81695 all this, \nd Yeshua¦81703\nd* revealed himself again¦81701 to his trainees at Lake Galilee. It happened like this:
\v 2 Simon¦81718 Peter¦81719, Thomas¦81721 nicknamed ‘Twin¦81724’, \nd Nathanael¦81726\nd* from Cana¦81732 in Galilee¦81734, the sons¦81736 of Zebedee¦81740, and two¦81749 other¦81743 trainees had gathered together¦81717
\v 3 \x + \xo 21:3: \xt Luk 5:5.\x*when Simon¦81753 Peter¦81754 said that he was going¦81755 fishing¦81756 and the others said that they'd join him.
\p So they went¦81765 off and got in the boat¦81773, but they didn't catch anything that night¦81779.
\p
\v 4 \nd When¦81792\nd* the dawn was approaching, \nd Yeshua¦81804\nd* was standing there on the shore¦81796, but¦81786 they didn't¦81797 know that it¦81805 was him.
\v 5 He called out, “\wj Hey, young fellas. Don't you¦81817 have any fish¦81816?\wj*”
\p “None.” they answered¦81818.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 21:6: \xt Luk 5:6.\x*Then¦81822 he said, “\wj Throw the net out over the right¦81829 side of the boat¦81832 and you'll find some.\wj*” So¦81840 they did it and they caught so many fish that the net was too heavy to pull back in.
\p
\v 7 Now the intern that \nd Yeshua¦81890\nd* loved said to Peter, “It's the master!” When Simon¦81897 Peter heard¦81900 that, he put on his robe (because¦81909 he didn't have it on), and jumped overboard into the lake¦81917.
\v 8 The other¦81920 trainees followed in the little¦81924 boat¦81924 dragging¦81941 the net¦81943 behind them because¦81929 they¦81930 were only about¦81936 100m out from the shore.
\v 9 When they went up the beach, they saw some bread¦81960 there and a charcoal¦81954 fire¦81954 with fish¦81957 cooking on it¦81958
\v 10 and \nd Yeshua¦81964\nd* told them, “\wj Bring¦81965 some of the fish¦81969 that you¦81971 just caught¦81971.\wj*”
\p
\v 11 So¦81975 Simon¦81976 Peter¦81977 went and dragged¦81979 the net up onto the beach. Amazingly it hadn't torn even though it contained 153 large¦81992 fish.
\v 12 Then \nd Yeshua¦82006\nd* said, “\wj Now, come and have breakfast¦82008.\wj*” But none of the trainees dared to ask who he was, because they figured it must be the \nd master¦82023\nd*.
\v 13 \nd Yeshua¦82028\nd* brought the bread¦82032 to them and shared it around, and then likewise¦82041 for the fish¦82040.
\p
\v 14 This was now the third¦82045 time¦82045 that \nd Yeshua¦82048\nd* had appeared to his trainees since he'd come back to life.

\v 15 While they were eating, Yeshua asked Simon Peter¦82063, “\wj Simon, son of Yohan¦82067, do you love me more than these¦82074?\wj*”
\p Peter answered, “Yes, \nd master¦82078\nd*, you know that I love you.”
\p Yeshua responded, “\wj Feed my¦82092 lambs¦82091.\wj*”
\v 16 Then he asked again¦82096, “\wj Simon¦82102, son of Yohan¦82103, do you love me?\wj*”
\p Peter replied, “Yes, \nd master¦82110\nd*, you know that I love you.”
\p Yeshua responded, “\wj Shepherd my¦82123 sheep¦82121.\wj*”
\v 17 Then¦82146 he asked a third time, “\wj Simon¦82128, son of Yohan¦82129, do you love me?\wj*”
\p Peter¦82137 was now upset that he had been asked a third time if he loved him, and he answered, “\nd Master¦82150\nd*, you know everything.”
\p “\wj Feed my¦82170 sheep¦82168,\wj*” \nd Yeshua¦82165\nd* responded¦82139.
\v 18 “\wj I can assure you that while you are young¦82178, you dress yourself¦82180 and go wherever you want to go, but as you age, you'll be stretching¦82188 out your¦82193 hands¦82191 and others will dress you and will take you where you don't¦82213 want to go.\wj*”
\v 19 When he said this, Yeshua was indicating how Peter would die honouring \nd God¦82225\nd*, and he told Peter, “Keep following¦82231 me.”

\p
\v 20 \x + \xo 21:20: \xt Yhn 13:25.\x*When Peter¦82236 turned¦82233 around he saw that the intern that Yeshua loved was following¦82244 them—the one who had leaned on \nd Yeshua's¦82243\nd* chest¦82253 during the supper¦82250 and asked who the one was who would turn Yeshua over.
\v 21 Noticing him, Peter¦82272 asked \nd Yeshua¦82277\nd*, “\nd Master¦82278\nd*, what about¦82281 that one?”
\p
\v 22 But \nd Yeshua¦82285\nd* replied, “\wj If I want him to stay alive until¦82291 I come back, what business would it¦82293 be of yours? You just stay following¦82299 me.\wj*”
\p
\v 23 As a result of that, a rumour went¦82301 around the others that that one would not die, but \nd Yeshua¦82326\nd* never said that. (He only said, “If I want him to stay alive until¦82336 I come back, what business would it be of yours?”)
