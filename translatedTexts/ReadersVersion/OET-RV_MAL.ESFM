\is1 Introduction
\ip This document records some of God's messages that were given to the prophet Malaki (more accurately ‘Malʼākī’, although traditionally spelt as ‘Malachi’) to pass on to the Israeli people. It was written around 500 before Yeshua/Jesus (B.C.) once the replacement temple was finished in Yerushalem (Jerusalem). The main purpose of the messages is to encourage the priests and the people to turn back to God and obey him from their hearts. It's apparent that many of them were no longer obeying and worshipping God. The priests and the people were short-changing God by offering second-class animals for the sacrifices and none of them were following God's desires. But God intervened in order to judge and restore his people, and he will send a teacher to precede him to prepare the path and to restore his agreement.

\v 1 This is a message¦380162 that Yahweh¦380164 gave to Malaki for the Israelis:
\s1 Yahweh's love for the Israelis
\rem /s1 The Lord's Love for Israel; Jacob Loved, Esau Hated; Religious decline and hope of recovery; Israel Preferred to Edom; The Lord's Love for Israel
\p
\v 2 “I have loved you all,” says Yahweh, \add ≈but\add* you say, “How have you \add shown your\add* love for us?”
\p “Wasn't Esaw¦380181 Yacob's¦380182 brother¦380180?” declares Yahweh. “Yet I've loved Yacob\x + \xo 1:2-3: \xt Rom 9:13.\x*
\v 3 and \add ≈rejected\add* Esaw. I've turned¦380195 the hills \add where Esaw lived\add* into a wasteland¦380199 and \add given\add* his inheritance¦380202 to the wild jackals¦380203.”
\p
\v 4 If \add Esaw's descendants in\add* Edom¦380209 say, “We've \add ≈been crushed\add*, but we'll return¦380211 and \add ≈rebuild¦380212 what was destroyed\add*,” then army-commander¦380217 Yahweh will say, “They might build¦380219, but I will tear down. Others will call them ‘The country of wickedness¦380225’ and ‘The people¦380226 who Yahweh is forever angry with.’
\p
\v 5 Your own eyes¦380235 will see¦380236 it, and¦380237 you'll say¦380238, ‘Yahweh¦380240 is great¦380239 even outside Israel's¦380243 borders¦380242.’ ”
\s1 Second-class sacrifices
\rem /s1 The Lord Reprimands the Priests; Unworthy Sacrifices; Blemished Sacrifices; Corruption of the Priesthood

\v 6 “A son honours his father, and a servant¦380248 \add ≡honours\add* his master, \add ≈so\add* if I'm a father, where is my honour? If I am a master, where is my respect¦380261?” says army-commander¦380265 Yahweh¦380264 to all you priests¦380267 who despise my name.
\p “But you say, ‘How have we despised your name?’
\v 7 By offering polluted food on my altar¦380280. But you say, ‘How have we polluted you?’ By saying¦380286 that Yahweh's¦380288 table¦380287 can \add just\add* be disrespected.
\v 8 Don't you think it's wrong when you sacrifice¦380296 blind¦380295 animals? Isn't it evil when you offer¦380294 lame or sick \add ≡animals\add*? Try presenting¦380305 them to your¦380314 governor¦380307! Will he welcome you or would¦380313 he \add ≈be offended\add*?” says¦380315 army-commander¦380317 Yahweh¦380316.\x + \xo 1:8: \xt Deu 15:21.\x*
\p
\v 9 \add ≈So¦380319 now\add* bring you requests to God¦380325 and \add ≈hope to be showered by his grace\add*. \add Ha,\add* army-commander¦380336 Yahweh¦380335 \add ≈asks how he could treat you all favourably when you're bringing second-class offerings\add*?
\p
\v 10 “Yeah, if only there¦380349 was one \add >person\add* among you who would shut the temple gates so that you all couldn't \add just continue\add* to light¦380346 worthless fires on my altar¦380347. I get no pleasure¦380352 from you all,” says¦380354 army-commander¦380356 Yahweh¦380355, “and I won't¦380344 accept¦380360 any offering¦380357 \add ≈that you all bring me\add*.
\v 11 People in other countries from the east \add all the way\add* to the west will honour me, and incense¦380376 and genuine sacrifices will be offered¦380379 to me, because my reputation in those countries will be praised,” says¦380386 army-commander¦380388 Yahweh¦380387.
\v 12 “But¦380392 you all are dishonouring \add @my name\add* when you say¦380393 that the master's¦380395 table¦380394 is polluted, and that its fruit¦380398, its food, can be treated with contempt.
\v 13 You all also say, ‘How tiresome this is,’ and you snort at it,” says army-commander¦380409 Yahweh. “You all bring \add animals\add* for your offering¦380421 that were killed by a wild animal or is lame or sick. Should I accept¦380422 those from you?” says Yahweh.
\v 14 “May the cheats be cursed¦380429 who have male¦380433 animals in their flocks¦380432 and vow to give them, but instead sacrifices¦380435 a second-class animal to the master¦380437! Yes, I'm a powerful king¦380439,” says¦380442 army-commander¦380444 Yahweh¦380443, “and my name¦380445 will be carefully respected among the nations¦380447.”

\s1 A warning for the priests
\rem /s1 Admonition for the Priests; A Warning for the Priests
\p
\v 1 Now you priests¦380453, this command¦380451 is for all of you:
\v 2 Army-commander¦380471 Yahweh¦380470 says¦380469, “If you all won't listen¦380458 and won't \add ≈decide in your minds\add* to honour¦380467 to my \add ≈reputation\add*, then I'll send¦380472 a curse on you all—\add ≈in fact\add* I'll curse your blessings¦380480. Indeed, I've \add already\add* cursed them, because you all are not \add ≈internalising\add* \add <my instructions\add*.
\v 3 Listen, I'm about¦380491 to rebuke¦380491 your descendants, and I'll spread¦380496 the offal from your festivals¦380502 on your faces¦380500, and you all will be taken¦380503 away with it.
\v 4 That's so you'll all know¦380507 that it's me who sent¦380509 this command¦380512 to you: so that my agreement with the Levites can continue,” says¦380519 army-commander¦380521 Yahweh¦380520.\x + \xo 2:4: \xt Num 3:11-13.\x*
\p
\v 5 “My agreement with \add @your ancestor Levi\add* was \add to give\add* life¦380527 and peace¦380528, and I gave¦380529 them to \add #them\add*. It was an agreement \add ≈based on respect\add*, and \add #they\add* respected me and \add ≈honoured\add* my name¦380535.\x + \xo 2:5: \xt Num 25:12.\x*
\v 6 \add ≈They taught the people what was right and true—they didn't¦380544 tell lies\add*. \add #They\add* \add ≈worked for me peacefully¦380548 and loyally\add*, and they \add ≈encouraged many people to stop disobeying\add*.
\v 7 \add ≈Yes,\add* priests¦380559 should pass on knowledge¦380562 and¦380563 people¦380564 should look to \add #them\add* \add ≈for good teaching\add*, because they¦380560 are army-commander¦380570 Yahweh's¦380568 messengers¦380567.
\p
\v 8 But¦380573 you all have turned¦380574 away from \add that\add* path¦380577 and have caused¦380578 many \add >people\add* to stumble¦380578 \add ≈because of what you've taught\add*—you all have corrupted¦380581 the agreement with Levi¦380583,” says¦380584 army-commander¦380586 Yahweh¦380585.
\v 9 “So¦380588 that's why I've caused you all to be despised¦380593 by all the people¦380597 and humiliated—because¦380598 you all haven't \add ≈followed me\add*, but rather you've been biased in matters¦380598 of the law.”
\s1 The people have been unfaithful
\rem /s1 A Call to Faithfulness; The Covenant Profaned by Judah; Judah Unfaithful; The People's Unfaithfulness to God
\p
\v 10 Don't we all have one father¦380611? Didn't the one God¦380615 create¦380617 us all? \add So\add* why do we cheat each other, thus disrespecting the agreement with our ancestors¦380624?
\v 11 \add Our nation of\add* Yehudah¦380627 \add (Judah)\add* has been unfaithful \add to Yahweh\add* and done detestable things in Israel¦380630 and in Yerushalem¦380631. \add ≈Our men\add* have defiled the temple that Yahweh loves¦380639 by \add ≈marrying foreign¦380644 women who worship pagan gods\add*.
\v 12 May Yahweh, the one who is awake and the one who answers¦380652, banish the \add #men\add* who do this from Israel, even if \add #they\add* are bringing¦380655 an offering¦380656 to army-commander¦380658 Yahweh.
\p
\v 13 Secondly¦380666, you cover¦380664 Yahweh's¦380669 altar¦380668 with tears from all your weeping¦380670 and groaning¦380671 because¦380672 he still¦380673 ignores your offerings¦380677 and won't accept¦380678 what you all bring to him.
\v 14 \add ≈So¦380682\add* you \add ≈ask\add*, “Why not?” \add Well,\add* it's because Yahweh¦380689 can testify¦380690 that you've been unfaithful to the wife that you \add ≈married\add* when you were young, even though she was your companion¦380701, and despite your vows.
\v 15 Didn't \add @Yahweh\add* make \add you and your wife\add* one and give you some of his spirit because he wanted godly children \add to come from your marriage\add*? \add ≈So¦380705\add* guard¦380717 yourselves in your spirit, and don't¦380705 be unfaithful to the \add ≈woman you married when you were young\add*.
\p
\v 16 “Indeed, I hate divorce,” says Yahweh, the God¦380731 of Israel¦380732, “and \add ≈so-called ‘good people’ who're actually cruel\add*,” says army-commander¦380740 Yahweh. “So \add ≈listen to your consciences\add* and don't¦380743 be unfaithful.”

\p
\v 17 You've all wearied Yahweh with your words¦380749, and \add yet\add* you \add ≈ask¦380750\add*, “How have we wearied him¦380752?” By saying, “Yahweh is pleased \add even\add* with those who do evil¦380757, and he's happy with \add all\add* of them,” or “Where is the God¦380767 of justice¦380768?”
