\mt3 commonly called ‘Judges’
\is1 Introduction
\ip This document commonly called ‘\bk Judges\bk*’, contains a collection of accounts of ‘\bk Various Heroes and Guides/Leaders\bk*’ who helped to rescue the Israeli people from their oppressors. It covers the times from their invasion of Canaan through to just before their first king. Most of these heroes or guides were actually warriors. Shimshon (commonly called ‘Samson’) is the best-known of all of them, and his story can be read in chapters 13–16.
\ip From this document we can learn that Yisrael (‘Israel’ in older English translations) prospered when they obeyed Yahweh's instructions, but when they disobeyed, then God allowed other peoples and nations to oppress them. However, God is always ready and prepared to save his people whenever they turn away from their disobedience and return again to obeying the instructions that he'd given them.
\ip The previous book was named after the main character Yehoshua (Joshua) and the following books (Ruth and 1 Shemuel/Samuel) are named after their main characters, but this document with somewhere around a dozen important characters, has no single prominent character that it could be named after. Instead it's traditionally named ‘Judges’ in English because of around twenty uses of the Hebrew root ‘שָׁפַט’ (shafat) often in roots normally translated as ‘judged’. Despite that, there's not a single account in this document of these leaders judging the cases and conflicts of the common people. This dilemma offers two possible interpretations: 1/ that these leaders (often military leaders) did judge cases for the common people, but those details aren't recorded, or 2/ (which we've leaned more towards) that this Hebrew word has a wider range of meaning, and so we've leaned towards the English word ‘guided’ or ‘led’ in these contexts.

\v 1 After Yehoshua's death¦111579, the Israelis¦111583 asked Yahweh, “\add ≈Which tribe should go¦111587 first¦111593 to attack the Canaanites¦111592\add*?”
\v 2 “Yehudah¦111599 will go¦111600 first,” Yahweh¦111598 \add ≈answered\add*. “Listen, I've \add ≈already determined that they'll conquer\add* the land.”
\p
\v 3 Then the Yehudah¦111609 \add leaders\add* said¦111608 to \add the tribe of\add* Simeon¦111610, “\add ≈Come\add* with \add #us\add* into the region that we've been allocated and we can fight¦111615 together against the Canaanites¦111616.

\v 5 They \add ≈confronted\add* Adoni¦111645-Bezek in Bezek and fought¦111648 against him (then eventually defeating¦111650 the Canaanites¦111653 and the Perizzites¦111656).
\v 6 Adoni¦111659-Bezek¦111660 \add tried to\add* flee but they chased him and captured him, cutting off his thumbs¦111668 and big¦111670 toes.
\v 7 “Seventy kings¦111678 had their thumbs¦111679 and big¦111681 toes chopped off,” Adoni¦111673-Bezek¦111675 said¦111672, “and were gathering¦111684 scraps of food beneath my table¦111686.

\v 14 \add ≈After the wedding\add*, she urged¦111805 \add @Otniel\add* to ask¦111806 her father¦111809 for a field¦111810. When she got off her donkey¦111813, Caleb¦111817 asked her, “What can I do for you?”
\v 15 “Give me a blessing¦111827,” she \add ≈requested\add*. “Although you've given¦111831 me land in the southern wilderness, give¦111832 me some springs of water¦111835 as well.” So¦111822 Caleb¦111839 gave¦111836 her the upper¦111842 springs and the lower¦111845 springs.

\v 21 and then Ehud¦113118 reached¦113117 with his left hand¦113121 and pulled the sword from his right¦113129 thigh¦113128 and plunged it into \add @the king's\add* belly¦113131.
\v 22 Even the handle went in after¦113137 the blade and the fat closed¦113139 up over the handle because \add @Ehud\add* didn't¦113144 pull the sword out of his belly¦113147. Then¦113133 he went out to the passage\f + \fr 3:22 \ft The meaning of the last word in the Hebrew here is uncertain, so other translations might differ.\f*
\v 23 and closed¦113154 and locked¦113158 the rooms of the upper room and exited through the porch.\f + \fr 3:23 \ft Again, the Hebrew meaning of the last word here is uncertain, so other translations might differ.\f*
\v 24 After¦113173 he'd left, the servants¦113162 came¦113163 and found the doors¦113166 locked¦113168, so they thought \add @the king\add* must be relieving himself¦113175 in \add *there\add*.
\v 25 They¦113194 waited¦113179 until¦113180 they \add ≈became worried\add* that he hadn't opened the doors¦113189, \add ≈so\add* they got a key and opened \add them\add*, only to find their¦113199 master¦113199 lying¦113200 dead¦113202 on the floor.
\p
\v 26 While \add @the servants\add* had been waiting, Ehud had escaped and passed¦113209 beyond the quarries, then fleeing to Seirah.
\v 27 When he got there, he blew a trumpet¦113219 \add ≈throughout\add* the Efrayimite hill country, and \add so\add* the \add ≈Israelis¦113226 assembled under his direction\add* down \add in the valley\add*.
\v 28 “Follow after me,” he told them, “because Yahweh¦113240 \add ≈will enable you all to defeat your enemies¦113243, the Moabites\add*.” So¦113233 they followed him down to the Yordan¦113254 \add river\add* and captured the fords¦113253 opposite Moab¦113246, thus preventing anyone¦113259 from crossing¦113260.
\v 29 Then¦113262 they \add ≈attacked Moab¦113265 and killed around ten¦113268 thousand¦113269 men\add*—all strong and capable yet none of them escaped¦113279.
\v 30 \add ≈So¦113282\add* Moab¦113283 was subdued¦113282 that day¦113284 by the Israelis¦113288, and \add ≈there was peace¦113289 in the region\add* for eighty¦113291 years.

\v 2 \add ≈so\add* \add *he\add* handed them over to King Yabin¦113333 of Canaan¦113336 who reigned¦113338 in Hatsor. Sisera¦113343 was the commander¦113340 of his army, and he lived in Haroshet¦113346-Haggoyim¦113347.
\v 3 The¦113368 Israelis¦113352 cried¦113349 out to Yahweh¦113355 because \add @Sisera\add* had nine¦113357 hundred¦113358 chariots¦113359 with iron on them, and he cruelly¦113369 oppressed¦113364 \add *them\add* for twenty¦113370 years.
\p
\v 4 \add ≈Now¦113381\add* the prophetess¦113376 Deborah¦113374 (Lappidot's¦113378 wife¦113377) was leading Yisrael¦113383 at that time¦113384.
\v 5 She \add ≈would sit\add* under¦113389 the palm tree¦113391 between Ramah¦113394 and Beyt-El (in the Efrayimite hill country¦113399), and \add ≈people¦113403\add* would come to her \add ≈to have their disputes settled\add*.
\v 6 \add One day\add* she summoned Barak¦113409 (Abinoam's¦113412 son from Kedesh¦113413 in Naftali) and told him, “Yisrael's¦113423 God¦113421, Yahweh¦113420 commands¦113418 you¦113429 to draft ten¦113430 thousand¦113431 men from Naftali and Zebulun and \add assemble\add* at Mt. Tabor¦113427.
\v 7 Yahweh will lure King Yabin's¦113450 army commander¦113447, Sisera¦113446 bring his warriors and chariots¦113453 to the Kishon¦113443 river, and \add ≈Yahweh will enable you¦113439 to defeat them there\add*.”
\p
\v 8 “I'll go if you'll come with me,” \add ≈replied\add* Barak¦113462, “\add ≈but\add* if you won't come with me, I won't go.”
\p
\v 9 “I'll¦113478 certainly¦113477 go with you,” she said, “but it won't¦113482 be you that's honoured \add ≈afterwards\add*, but \add rather\add* Yahweh¦113496 \add ≈will use a woman¦113494 to defeat\add* Sisera¦113499.” So¦113476 Deborah¦113501 \add ≈accompanied\add* Barak¦113508 to Kedesh¦113509.
\v 10 \add There\add* \add *he\add* summoned¦113511 \add warriors from\add* Zebulun and Naftali¦113518 and ten¦113522 thousand¦113523 men came, and \add they all went¦113525 together\add* with Deborah¦113527 \add to Mt. Tabor\add*.
\p
\v 11 \add ≈Now\add* Heber had moved \add with his wife Yael and their family\add* \add ≈away from the other\add* Kenites¦113530 (and from Mosheh's¦113536 father-in-law Hobab's¦113534 descendants) and set up his tent by the oak tree¦113541 at Zaanannim¦113542 near Kedesh¦113547.
\p
\v 12 \add ≈When\add* Sisera¦113550 was told that Barak¦113553 (Abinoam's¦113556 son) had gone to Mt. Tabor¦113559,
\v 13 \add *he\add* assembled his warriors and their nine¦113569 hundred¦113570 chariots¦113568 (with iron on them) \add and went from\add* Haroshet¦113580-Haggoyim¦113581 to the Kishon¦113585 riverbed.
\p
\v 14 “Get going,” Deborah¦113588 told Barak, “because it's today that Yahweh¦113598 has gone ahead of you and \add ≈will help you defeat\add* Sisera¦113601.” So¦113587 Barak led his ten¦113611 thousand¦113612 warriors down from Mt. Tabor¦113610.
\v 15 Then¦113616 Yahweh¦113617 \add ≈caused Sisera and all his warriors and chariots¦113625 to be confused as Barak¦113635 advanced\add*, \add ≈so\add* Sisera jumped down from his chariot¦113639 and took off on foot¦113641.
\v 16 Barak pursued¦113644 the men and chariots¦113646 as far as Haroshet¦113650-Haggoyim¦113651 and they killed them all—not a single one survived.

\v 17 \add ≈But¦113666\add* Sisera had fled on foot¦113668 \add and ran to\add* Yael's¦113672 tent (Heber the Kenite's¦113678 wife¦113673) because there was peace¦113680 between King Yabin¦113682 of Hatsor and the house¦113687 of Heber the Kenite.
\v 18 Yael¦113692 went out to meet Sisera¦113694 and told him, “\add ≈Stop and rest\add*, my master¦113698. \add ≈Stop and rest here\add*. Don't be afraid¦113703.” So¦113691 he turned¦113704 and went into her tent, and she covered¦113707 him with a blanket.
\p
\v 19 “I'm thirsty¦113719,” he said. “Could you get me a little¦113715 water¦113717 to drink.” \add @Yael\add* opened¦113720 a goatskin container and gave him milk to drink, then she covered¦113726 him \add again\add*.
\v 20 “Stand at the tent doorway,” he said¦113728, “and if anyone comes and asks¦113738 you if \add ≈you've seen a man\add*, say¦113744, ‘No.’ ”
\p
\v 21 Then¦113747 Heber's¦113751 wife¦113749 Yael¦113748 got a hammer¦113759 and a tent peg and \add ≈crept in silently\add*, driving the peg through his temple¦113768 and pounding it into the ground,. He'd been tired and was sleeping¦113773 soundly, and \add ≈it killed him\add*.
\v 22 \add ≈Meanwhile\add* Barak¦113778 \add ≈had been searching for\add* Sisera, and Yael¦113784 went out to meet him. “Come in here,” she told him, “and I'll show you the man¦113792 you've been searching for.” He \add ≈followed her into the tent\add* and wow—Sisera was lying¦113801 there dead with the peg \add still\add* through his temple¦113804.
\p
\v 23 \add ≈So¦113806\add* that day¦113808 God¦113807 defeated Canaanite King Yabin's¦113811 \add army\add* \add ≈in front¦113815 of the Israelis¦113817\add*,

\v 17 “If indeed I've found¦114565 favour¦114566 in your¦114567 eyes¦114567,” Gideon \add ≈requested\add*, “then \add ≈show me a miracle so I'll know that it's God\add* speaking¦114572 to me.
\v 18 Please \add ≈wait here\add* \add while I go and prepare\add* my gift¦114587 for you and bring¦114584 it back here for you.”
\p “\add Okay,\add* I'll stay \add here\add* until you get back,” he said¦114590.
\p
\v 19 Then¦114596 Gideon¦114596 went¦114597 a prepared a young goat and unrisen bread¦114605. He put the meat in a basket¦114608 and the soup in a pot and brought¦114612 them out to the oak tree and offered them to him.
\v 20 Then God's messenger¦114623 said¦114621, “Take the meat and the flat bread¦114631 and put them on this rock¦114635, then pour the soup out \add over it\add*.” \add ≈So\add* \add @Gideon\add* did that
\v 21 and Yahweh's messenger stretched out the staff¦114650 that he was holding and touched¦114653 the meat and bread with the end of it. A fire flamed up from the rock and burnt up the meat and bread, then Yahweh's messenger went out of his sight¦114671.\f + \fr 6:21 \ft It's unclear from the text, whether he just got up and walked away, or if he vanished in a more miraculous fashion.\f*
\p
\v 22 When Gideon¦114674 \add ≈realised\add* that it \add really\add* had been Yahweh's messenger, he \add ≈was upset and said\add*, “Oh no, my master¦114684 Yahweh, \add ≈what will happen now that\add* I've seen Yahweh's face to face?”
\v 23 But¦114699 Yahweh¦114701 \add ≈replied\add* to him, “Peace to you. Don't be afraid¦114706—you won't¦114704 die¦114708.”
\v 24 \add ≈So¦114710\add* Gideon¦114712 built¦114710 an altar¦114713 there to \add sacrifice\add* to Yahweh and named it ‘Yahweh is peace¦114719’. (It's still¦114723 stands there at Ofrah¦114724 of the Abi-Ezrite to this day¦114721.)
\p
\v 25 \add ≈That same\add* night¦114730, Yahweh¦114734 told him, “Take the young¦114738 bull that belongs to your father, and the second¦114744 bull seven¦114745 years¦114746 old. Break the altar¦114750 of Baal¦114751 into pieces that belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah pole that's beside it.
\v 26 Build a \add ≈regular\add* altar¦114763 to your¦114765 God¦114765 Yahweh¦114764 on top of this stronghold¦114768, then take¦114771 the second¦114775 bull¦114774 and offer a whole burnt¦114777 offering using the Asherah pole that you¦114781 cut down \add ≈for firewood\add*.”
\v 27 \add ≈So¦114783\add* Gideon¦114784 took ten of his servants¦114787 and did what Yahweh¦114792 had instructed him to, \add ≈but\add* he did it at night¦114807 because he was afraid to do it in the daytime—\add fearing the anger of\add* his father's¦114799 household¦114798 and the men of the city¦114803.
\rem /s1 Gideon Destroys the Altar of Baal
\p
\v 28 When the men¦114810 of the city¦114811 got up early the next morning¦114812, wow, the Baal's¦114816 altar had been torn down, the Asherah pole that was beside it had been cut down, and the second¦114824 bull¦114823 had been offered¦114825 on a \add new\add* altar that had been built¦114829.
\v 29 \add ≈So¦114831\add* people started asking each other, “Who did this?” After some investigation, they said, “Yoash's¦114846 son Gideon¦114843 did it.”
\v 30 Then¦114851 the men¦114852 of the city¦114853 told Yoash¦114856, “Bring your son out \add here\add* \add ≈to be executed\add*, because¦114868 he tore down the Baal's¦114867 altar¦114866 and cut down the Asherah \add pole\add* that was beside it.”
\p
\v 31 “\add ≈Are you all really fighting Baal's¦114885 battle for him\add*?” Yoash¦114876 replied to those¦114878 standing against him. “Are you all really helping him? Whoever fights on his behalf should¦114902 be be put to death¦114894 while it is still the morning¦114897. If \add @Baal\add* is a god¦114900, then let him stand up for himself when someone¦114905 tears down his altar¦114908.”
\v 32 \add ≈So¦114910 after that\add*, he called¦114910 \add @Gideon\add* ‘Yerub-Baal’ to say¦114917 ‘Let Baal defend himself,’ because he had torn down \add @Baal's\add* altar¦114925.
\p
\v 33 \add ≈Meanwhile\add* all the Midianite and Amalekite \add warriors\add* and others from the east, assembled together¦114936. Then they¦114935 crossed¦114937 the Yordan and set up camp in the Jezreel valley¦114939.
\v 34 \add ≈But¦114942\add* Yahweh's¦114943 spirit¦114942 \add ≈enabled\add* Gideon¦114947, and he blew a trumpet¦114949 and called¦114950 the \add men of\add* Abiezer¦114954 to follow¦114955 him¦114955.
\v 35 Then¦114957 he sent messengers throughout all of \add the regions of\add* Manashsheh¦114961, Asher¦114972, Zebulun¦114973, and Naftali¦114974, and summoned \add their warriors\add* to come and join with them.

\p
\v 36 Then¦114978 Gideon¦114979 said to God¦114982, “If¦114988 it's \add really\add* you rescuing Yisrael¦114990 \add ≈through me\add* like you said,

\v 38 And¦115032 that's what happened—he rose early¦115029 the next morning¦115030 and squeezed¦115031 the fleece and wrung¦115035 out a bowl full of water¦115042 from the dew.
\v 39 Then¦115044 Gideon¦115045 said¦115044 to God¦115048, “Don't \add ≈be angry with me\add*, but \add ≈can I ask one more thing\add*. Let me put the fleece out this time¦115062, and let the fleece be dry, but wet all around it with dew.”

\p
\v 1 Then Gideon¦115105 (\add also known as\add* Yerub-Baal) and the warriors with him got up early¦115102 and \add went to\add* Harod¦115115 spring. The Midianite camp was north¦115121 of them in the valley¦115124 below¦115122 the Moreh¦115123 hill.
\p
\v 2 Then¦115126 Yahweh¦115127 told Gideon¦115130, “\add ≈You've got too many warriors with you¦115134 for me to give¦115135 victory over the Midianites, because what if Yisrael¦115144 takes the glory for themselves thinking that their¦115139 own strength saved them\add*.
\v 3 \add ≈So¦115150\add* tell the men that anyone who's afraid or trembling¦115159 can leave¦115161 Mt. Gilead¦115163 and go¦115160 back home.” Twenty-two thousand of them went back, leaving \add only\add* ten¦115171 thousand.\x + \xo 7:3: \xt Deu 20:8.\x*
\p
\v 4 “That's still¦115181 too many,” Yahweh¦115177 told Gideon¦115180. “Bring them down to the \add ≈spring\add* and I'll short-list them there¦115191. Whoever I tell you to go with you, can do so, but anyone that I say won't go with you, won't go.”
\v 5 \add ≈So¦115217\add* he took them down to the water and Yahweh¦115226 told \add *him\add*, “\add ≈Separate¦115229 out those\add* who lap up the water with \add #their tongues¦115234\add* like a dog would, \add ≈along with those\add* who kneel down to drink¦115251.”
\v 6 \add ≈It turned out\add* that \add only\add* three¦115260 hundred¦115261 men used their hands¦115256 to bring water to their mouths¦115259, and all the rest knelt down to drink¦115270 the water.
\v 7 “I'll \add ≈rescue\add* you¦115284 all from Midian¦115288 with the three¦115279 hundred¦115280 men who lapped¦115282 the water \add from their hands\add*,” Yahweh¦115275 told Gideon¦115278. “Let all the others go¦115293 back to their homes.”
\v 8 Then¦115297 the three-hundred warriors \add ≈collected\add* the food and ram's horns from the others before \add @Gideon\add* sent¦115310 the others back to their own \add ≈homes\add*.
\p The¦115309 Midian¦115319 camp was below \add #them\add* \add down\add* in the valley¦115323
\v 9 and during the night¦115327 Yahweh¦115331 told \add @Gideon\add*, “\add ≈Get ready\add* and \add lead them\add* down into the camp, because I have \add ≈made you victorious\add*.
\v 10 \add ≈But¦115339\add* if you're afraid¦115341 to \add ≈attack\add*, take your¦115347 servant¦115347 Purah¦115346 down to \add &their\add* camp
\v 11 and you'll hear¦115352 what they're saying, then \add ≈you'll have the courage to go¦115359 down\add* \add and attack\add* the camp.” So¦115352 \add @Gideon\add* and his servant¦115364 Purah¦115363 went \add quietly\add* down to the \add ≈unit\add* at the edge of the camp.
\p
\v 12 The Midianites and Amalekites¦115373 and others from the east covered the valley¦115380 like a swarm of locusts¦115381. \add Even\add* their¦115383 camels¦115383 were as numerous as sand grains on the beach.
\v 13 \add ≈When\add* Gideon¦115394 \add ≈got close\add*, a man was telling his companion about his dream. “Listen,” he said, “I had a dream and wow, a round¦115406 loaf of barley¦115409 bread¦115408 was tumbling¦115410 into \add ≈our\add* camp.

\p
\v 14 “\add ≈That could only be\add* the sword¦115432 of Yoash's¦115436 son Gideon¦115433 from Yisrael¦115438,” \add ≈the other man¦115437\add* replied. “The true God¦115440 has \add ≈caused Midian¦115444 and all of the camp to be defeated by him\add*.”
\p
\v 15 When Gideon¦115454 heard¦115453 the account of the dream¦115458 and its interpretation¦115461, he \add ≈thanked God\add*, then \add #they\add* returned¦115463 to \add *their\add* camp and \add ≈commanded\add*, “\add ≈Get ready to go\add* because Yahweh¦115473 has given¦115472 \add ≈you all victory over\add* the Midianite camp.”
\v 16 Then¦115481 he divided¦115480 the three hundred¦115485 men into three units, and gave¦115489 each of them rams' horns and \add clay\add* jars with \add burning\add* torches¦115496 inside them,

\v 18 When I blow the ram's horn trumpet¦115519, all of you¦115529 with horns should blow them and \add everyone\add* will shout, ‘For Yahweh¦115535 and for Gideon¦115536!’ ”
\p
\v 19 \add ≈When\add* Gideon and the hundred¦115541 men with him got to the edge of the camp, it was the beginning¦115549 of the middle¦115551 nightwatch and \add ≈the fresh guards had just gotten into their places\add*. \add @Gideon and his unit\add* blew their trumpets¦115559 and smashed¦115560 the jars \add ≈that they¦115554 were carrying\add*.
\v 20 Then¦115565 \add all\add* three¦115566 units blew the trumpets and smashed their jars. They held the torches¦115576 in their left hands and the trumpets in their right¦115579 hands, and they shouted out, “A sword¦115583 for Yahweh¦115584 and for Gideon¦115585.”
\v 21 Then¦115587 everyone¦115588 stood¦115587 in their place¦115589 around the camp, \add ≈but\add* the \add Midianite\add* army cried¦115596 out \add in alarm\add* and \add ≈took off\add*.
\v 22 When the three¦115601 hundred¦115603 ram's horns \add ≈sounded\add*, Yahweh¦115606 \add ≈caused the Midianite army to start fighting each other with their swords¦115608\add*, and the army fled as far as Beyt-Shittah¦115619 (towards Tsererah¦115620) and towards the border¦115622 of Abel-Meholah (towards Tabbat¦115628).
\p
\v 23 Then¦115630 the \add ≈warriors\add* from Naftali¦115634, Asher¦115637, and from all of Manashsheh¦115642 were summoned \add ≈to help with pursuing¦115643 the Midianites\add*.

\v 2 “What \add ≈have I achieved compared¦115752 to you¦115752 guys\add*?” \add ≈answered\add* \add @Gideon\add*. “Aren't the \add ≈seconds\add* of Efrayim's¦115756 grapes better than the \add whole\add* grape¦115757 harvest¦115757 of Abiezer¦115758?

\p

\v 5 \add When they arrived at the town\add* of Sukkot, Gideon asked the \add ≈leaders\add*, “Please give¦115803 my men¦115801 some bread¦115807 to eat because they're exhausted¦115813, \add ≈but we're chasing¦115816\add* Zebah¦115818 and Zalmunna, the Midianite kings¦115820.”
\p
\v 6 \add ≈However, the Sukkot officials¦115824 asked\add* \add cautiously\add*, “\add ≈Do you already have Zebah¦115827 and Zalmunna¦115828 in your grasp\add* that we¦115833 should give¦115833 \add ≈food\add* to \em your\em* army?”

\v 7 “Let me assure you all,” Gideon¦115838 \add ≈responded¦115837\add*, “that when Yahweh¦115841 has \add ≈helped us capture Zebah¦115844 and Zalmunna¦115847\add*, I will rip off your¦115852 flesh¦115852 with the wilderness¦115856 thorns¦115855 and briers¦115859.”
\p
\v 8 From there they climbed up to Penuel¦115863, and he \add ≈asked them for food in a similar manner\add*, and the \add ≈leaders there\add* responded similarly to the \add ≈leaders\add* of Sukkot.

\v 11 Gideon¦115915 approached them \add unexpectedly\add* via the caravan route east of Nobah¦115920 and Jogbehah¦115921, and struck their camp when they were feeling secure¦115928.

\v 13 The Gideon¦115954 (Yoash's¦115957 son) \add and his warriors\add* returned¦115953 from battle¦115960, going through the Heres¦115962 pass.

\v 29 Then \add Gideon¦116262\add* (Yoash's¦116265 son, \add also known as\add* Yerub-Baal) went¦116261 back and lived in his house¦116267,
\v 30 and \add *he\add* fathered seventy¦116271 sons¦116272 because he had many wives¦116277.
\v 31 He¦116293 \add also\add* had a mistress in Shekem¦116284—she also bore him a son that he named Abimelek¦116296.
\v 32 Gideon¦116299 died¦116298 at a good¦116304 old age and¦116305 was buried¦116305 in the tomb¦116306 of Yoash¦116302 his father¦116308, at Ofrah¦116307 of the \add #Abiezerites\add*.

\v 1 \add ≈Now\add* Gideon's son Abimelek¦116366 went¦116365 to Shekem¦116370 to his mother's brothers¦116373 and spoke¦116375 to \add @those uncles\add* and to all the \add ≈extended\add* family of his mother's father¦116384, saying,
\v 2 “Please \add ≈ask around\add* all the citizens¦116394 of Shekem¦116395: ‘What is better for you: Gideon's seventy¦116402 sons ruling over you, or having a single man \add ≈in charge\add*?’ Remember that I'm your flesh¦116421 and bone.”
\v 3 \add ≈So his uncles working\add* on his behalf, passed that onto all the citizens¦116433 of Shekem¦116434, and \add ≈they became convinced in\add* Abimelek¦116443, because they said¦116445, “He's our brother¦116446.”
\v 4 Then¦116449 they gave¦116449 him seventy¦116452 silver¦116453 coins from the temple¦116454 of Baal¦116458-Berith¦116462, and Abimelek¦116465 \add ≈used them to entice some rough lay-abouts to work for\add* him.
\v 5 Then¦116472 \add #they\add* went¦116472 to his father's¦116475 house¦116473 at Ofrah¦116476, and he killed¦116477 his seventy¦116484 \add half-\add*brothers (Gideon's sons¦116481) there on one stone¦116491. But¦116472 Gideon's youngest son Yotam survived¦116493 because he had hidden \add from them\add*.
\v 6 Then all of the \add prominent\add* citizens¦116506 of Shekem and all of Beyt-Millo¦116511 assembled themselves, and they went¦116512 and installed Abimelek¦116516 as king¦116517 beside an oak tree¦116520 near the standing pillar\f + \fr 9:6 \ft Likely connected with idol worship.\f* that was in Shekem.

\p
\v 7 \add ≈When\add* they told Yotam, he went¦116527 and stood¦116528 on the top of Mt. Gerizim¦116532 and shouted out to them all \add ≈in a loud voice¦116534\add*, “Listen to me, citizens¦116540 of Shekem¦116541, so God¦116544 will listen to all of you.
\v 8 Once the trees¦116548 went¦116547 about in order to appoint a king¦116551 for themselves¦116550, \add ≈So\add* they said¦116552 to the \em olive¦116553 tree¦116553\em*, ‘Reign over us.’
\v 9 \add ≈But¦116558\add* the olive¦116560 tree¦116560 replied to them, ‘Have I stopped producing my \add ≈valuable oil used to\add* honour¦116568 gods¦116569 and men¦116570, that I should go¦116571 to sway above the \add other\add* trees¦116575?’
\v 10 \add ≈So¦116577\add* the trees¦116578 said¦116577 to the \em fig¦116579 tree¦116579\em*, ‘You come¦116580 \add and\add* reign¦116583 over us.’
\v 11 \add ≈But¦116586\add* the fig¦116588 tree¦116588 \add answered\add* them, ‘Have I stopped producing my sweetness¦116592 and my good¦116596 fruit¦116595, that I should go¦116597 to sway above the \add other\add* trees¦116601?’
\v 12 Then¦116603 the trees¦116604 said¦116603 to the grapevine¦116605, ‘You come¦116606 \add and\add* reign¦116609 over us.’
\v 13 \add ≈But¦116613\add* the vine¦116615 \add ≈replied\add*, ‘Have I stopped producing my new wine, which cheers¦116620 gods¦116621 and man, that I should go¦116623 to sway over the \add other\add* trees¦116627?’
\v 14 Then¦116629 all the trees¦116632 said¦116629 to the thornbush, ‘\em You\em* come¦116636 \add and\add* reign¦116638 over us!’
\v 15 The thornbush told the trees¦116646, ‘If you all are \add ≈really wanted to anoint¦116650\add* me as king¦116652 over you, come¦116654 \add and\add* take¦116655 refuge¦116655 in \em my\em* shade¦116656. But¦116642 if \add ≈you all don't¦116659\add*, may the thornbush send out fire¦116661 to \add ≈burn up\add* Lebanon's¦116669 cedar¦116668 \add forests\add*.’
\p
\v 16 “\add ≈Therefore did\add* you all act with honesty and integrity¦116675 when you installed Abimelek¦116680 as king? Did you all treat \add ≈Gideon's family\add* well, and did you all \add ≈repay him appropriately for what he did for you all\add*?
\v 17 My father¦116701 fought¦116700 on your behalf, and even \add ≈risked¦116703\add* his life¦116706 out front¦116707 when he \add ≈rescued you all from the Midianites\add*,
\v 18 \add ≈but\add* today you've all risen¦116714 up against my father's¦116718 family and killed¦116720 his sons¦116723—seventy¦116724 men on one stone¦116728. Then¦116713 you've installed Abimelek¦116733, the son of his female servant, as king¦116730 over the citizens¦116739 of Shekem¦116740 because he's your¦116742 brother.
\v 19 \add ≈Now\add* if you've all acted¦116749 with honesty and integrity¦116748 with towards \add ≈Gideon¦116752 and his family\add* today, be happy with Abimelek¦116759, and he'll also be happy with all of you,
\v 20 \add ≈but\add* if not, then fire will come out of Abimelek¦116771 and destroy the citizens of Shekem and Beyt-Millo. Fire will also come out from the Shekem's citizens and from Beyt-Millo, and it'll destroy Abimelech¦116790.”
\v 21 Then¦116792 Yotam fled away and escaped and went¦116795 to Be'er and settled there¦116798 away from the presence of his \add half-\add*brother Abimelek¦116800.

\p
\v 22 Abimelek¦116805 ruled¦116804 over Yisrael¦116808 for three¦116809 years¦116810,
\v 23 then God¦116813 sent¦116812 an evil¦116815 spirit¦116814 between \add *him\add* and the citizens of Shekem¦116820, \add ≈so\add* the citizens \add *there\add* dealt¦116821 treacherously¦116821 with Abimelek¦116817.
\v 24 The violent¦116828 treatment of \add ≈Gideon's\add* seventy¦116829 sons¦116830 \add ≈kept getting brought up\add*, and by \add ≈it was all blamed on\add* their brother¦116838 Abimelech¦116837 who had killed¦116840 them, and on \add those of\add* Shekem's citizens¦116843 who \add ≈assisted him in\add* the killing of his brothers¦116854.
\v 25 \add ≈So¦116856\add* the Shekem¦116859 citizens¦116858 placed men in ambush¦116860 along the tops of the hills \add ≈to get him\add*, \add ≈but\add* they robbed¦116864 everyone¦116866 who went passed¦116870 them along the road¦116872, and \add so\add* it was reported¦116873 to Abimelech¦116865.
\p
\v 26 Then¦116889 Gaal¦116878 (Ebed's¦116881 son) came¦116877 along with his brothers and \add ≈moved into\add* Shekem¦116884, and the citizens¦116888 \add *there\add* \add began to\add* trust \add #them\add*.
\v 27 They went out into the field¦116892, and they picked grapes from their vineyards¦116896 and pressed them. They celebrated harvest festivals and they went into the house¦116901 of their gods, then they ate¦116903 and drank¦116904, and they cursed¦116905 Abimelek¦116908.
\v 28 Then¦116910 Gaal¦116912 (Ebed's¦116915 son) said¦116910, “Who's Abimelek, and who's Shekem, that we should serve him? Isn't \add @Abimelek\add* \add ≈Gideon's\add* son, and Zebul¦116928 is his deputy? Serve the descendants of Shekem's father¦116935 Hamor¦116934, \add ≈but\add* why should we serve \add @Abimelek\add*?
\v 29 Who will \add ≈fight with me to defeat those\add* people¦116945 and depose Abimelek? Then¦116941 he said¦116952 to Abimelek, ‘\add ≈Gather\add* your army and come¦116956 \add ≈and fight\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 30 When Zebul¦116959, the prince of the city¦116962, heard \add ≈what Ga'al (Ebed's¦116969 son) had said\add*, \add ≈he got very angry\add*
\v 31 and he sent¦116973 messengers¦116974 to Abimelek¦116977 in secret, saying, “Listen, Ebed's¦116984 son Gaal¦116981 and his brothers are coming¦116986 to Shekem¦116987, and wow¦116988, they're inciting the city¦116992 against¦116993 you.
\v 32 You and the people who are with you \add ≈should go out at night¦116997\add* and lie in ambush in the countryside¦117004.
\v 33 Then¦117006 \add ≈when the sun¦117009 rises\add* in the morning¦117007, you all should set out early¦117010 and spread out in an attack against¦117023 the city¦117014. Keep watch, then when \add @Ga'al\add* and the people with him are coming out toward you \add to fight\add*, then you \add can overpower them and\add* \add ≈treat him however you think fit\add*.”
\p
\v 34 \add ≈So\add* Abimelek¦117032 and all the people with him \add ≈went out in the night¦117039\add* and they set up four¦117044 units in an ambush against Shekem¦117043.
\v 35 \add In the morning,\add* Ga'al (Ebed's¦117051 son) went¦117047 out and he stood at the entrance¦117053 of the city¦117055 gate. Then¦117047 Abimelek¦117057 and \add ≈his men stood up from their hiding places\add*.
\v 36 \add ≈When\add* Ga'al saw the people, he said to Zebul¦117075, “Look, a group of people is coming¦117079 down from the tops of the hills!”
\p “You are seeing¦117089 the shadow¦117086 of the hills as men¦117090,” Zebul \add ≈responded¦117072\add*.
\p
\v 37 \add ≈But\add* Ga'al said again¦117094, “Look, groups of people¦117100 are coming down from beside the \add ≈top of the hill\add*, and \add ≈another group\add* is coming from the way of the ‘oak of the diviners’.”
\p
\v 38 Then¦117113 Zebul¦117115 said to him, “\add ≈Well, you were the one who\add* said, ‘Who is Abimelek¦117122 that we should serve¦117124 him?’ Aren't these the people who you \add ≈were scorning\add*? Indeed now, go¦117131 out and fight¦117135 against \add #them\add*.”
\v 39 \add ≈So\add* Ga'al went¦117139 out in front¦117141 of Shekem's citizens¦117142 and fought¦117144 against Abimelek¦117145.
\v 40 Abimelek¦117148 pursued him, and he \add ≈had to flee away from him\add*. Many \add of their men\add* fell fatally¦117152 wounded¦117152 as far as the entrance¦117156 of the city gate.
\v 41 Then¦117159 Abimelek¦117160 settled in Arumah¦117161, \add ≈but\add* Zebul¦117163 drove¦117162 Ga'al¦117166 and his brothers away from living in Shekem¦117171.
\p
\v 42 Now it so happened that the next day¦117174, the people¦117176 \add of Shekem\add* went¦117175 out into the countryside¦117177, and \add ≈it was reported¦117178\add* to Abimelek¦117179.
\v 43 So¦117181 he took¦117181 \add ≈his men\add* and split them into three¦117186 units. Then¦117181 he waited in ambush in the countryside¦117189. When¦117182 he saw¦117190 and wow, the people¦117192 were going¦117193 out of the city¦117196, then he \add ≈attacked\add* and killed¦117199 them.
\v 44 Abimelek¦117201 and the units that were with him had spread out and they stood¦117206 at the entrance¦117207 of the city¦117209 gate, and two¦117210 units spread out against everyone who was in the field¦117218 and killed¦117219 them.
\v 45 Abimelek¦117221 \add ≈spent that whole day attacking Shekem\add*. He captured¦117227 the city and \add #they\add* killed¦117237 the people¦117233 who were in it. Then¦117221 he tore \add *it\add* down, and scattered salt on \add @the land\add*.
\p
\v 46 When all the lords of the tower¦117250 of Shekem¦117252 heard¦117246, they went¦117253 into the citadel of the temple for El-Berit¦117259,
\v 47 \add ≈but\add* it was reported to Abimelek¦117262 that all the lords of the Shekem¦117270 tower¦117268 had gathered¦117264 there.
\v 48 So¦117272 Abimelek¦117273 and all the people with him, went up to Mt. Tsalmon¦117276. \add *He\add* took¦117284 axes and cut a branch¦117291 down from the trees, then lifted¦117293 it onto his shoulder¦117297 and said¦117298 to the people who were with him, “\add ≈What I just did, you all quickly do the same\add*.”
\v 49 So¦117312 all the people also each cut off a branch¦117319 and then \add ≈followed¦117320\add* Abimelek¦117322. They piled them on top of the underground chamber, \add ≈and that's how\add* they burnt out the underground chamber. As a result, all the distinguished people in the tower¦117338 of Shekem¦117340 also died—about¦117341 a thousand¦117341 men and women¦117343.
\p
\v 50 Then Abimelek¦117347 went¦117346 to Tebets and set up camp around \add *the city\add* and captured¦117353 it.
\v 51 \add ≈But¦117355\add* there¦117363 was a strong tower in the middle¦117359 of the city, so all of the men and the women¦117367 and all the prominent citizens¦117369 fled to it. \add ≈Once they were all in, they barricaded it up\add* and they went up onto the tower roof.
\v 52 Then¦117379 Abimelek¦117380 \add and his men\add* approached¦117386 the tower and fought¦117384 against it, and he came¦117379 in as close as the tower entrance¦117389 in order to \add ≈set fire¦117392 to it\add*,
\v 53 \add ≈but\add* a woman¦117395 threw¦117394 an upper¦117398 millstone down onto Abimelek's¦117404 head and¦117403 it crushed¦117403 his skull¦117406.\x + \xo 9:53: \xt 2Sam 11:21.\x*
\v 54 Then¦117408 he cried out hurriedly to the young man bearing his armour, “Draw out your sword¦117419 and put me to death, \add ≈because I don't want it to be said afterwards that I was killed¦117426 by\add* a woman¦117425.” \add ≈So¦117408\add* his young man stabbed him so that he died.
\v 55 \add ≈When\add* the \add ≈Israeli warriors\add* saw¦117431 that Abimelek¦117437 was dead¦117436, they¦117431 all returned to their own homes.
\p
\v 56 Thus God¦117443 avenged the evil¦117445 of Abimelek¦117446 that he had done to his father¦117449 \add Gideon\add* by killing¦117450 his seventy¦117453 brothers¦117454,
\v 57 and God¦117463 \add ≈caused all the evil¦117459 done by Shekem's men¦117460\add* to return back upon their¦117464 own heads¦117464, and the curse¦117467 of \add ≈Gideon's\add* \add youngest\add* son Yotam, came¦117465 true on them.

\p
\v 6 The \add ≈Israelis¦117555\add* continued to do \add ≈what Yahweh considered evil\add*: they worshipped the Ba'als, the Ashtorets, the gods of Aram¦117570, the gods of Sidon¦117574, the gods of Moab¦117578, the gods of the sons of Ammon¦117583, and the gods of the Philistines¦117586. They forsook Yahweh and didn't¦117591 serve¦117560 him.
\v 7 Yahweh¦117597 \add ≈was very angry with\add* Yisrael¦117598, so he \add ≈allowed the Philistines¦117602 and the Ammonites¦117605 to harass them\add*.
\v 8 They shattered and oppressed the \add ≈Israelis\add* that year¦117613, \add ≈but it went on\add* for eighteen¦117615 years for all the \add ≈Israelis\add* who were on the opposite side of the Yordan¦117626 in the land of the Amorites¦117628, which¦117629 is in the Gilead¦117630.
\v 9 Then¦117632 the \add ≈Ammonites¦117635\add* also crossed¦117632 over the Yordan¦117638 to fight¦117639 against Yehudah¦117642, against Benyamin¦117643, and against the \add ≈half-tribe\add* of Efrayim¦117645.
\p This caused incredible distress¦117646 for the \add ≈Israelis\add*
\v 10 \add ≈so\add* \add *they\add* cried¦117650 out to Yahweh¦117655, “We have sinned¦117657 against you, because¦117659 we have abandoned¦117660 our God¦117663 and we have served¦117664 the Ba'als.”
\p
\v 11 “Wasn't it from the Egyptians,” Yahweh¦117671 \add ≈responded¦117670\add*, “from the Amorites¦117680, from the \add ≈Ammonites¦117684\add*, from the Philistines¦117687,
\v 12 the Sidonians and Amalek and Maon, when they oppressed¦117692 you that you cried¦117694 out to me, and I \add ≈rescued you all from them\add*?
\v 13 \add ≈Yet\add* you've all abandoned¦117701 me and served¦117703 other¦117705 gods¦117704. Therefore, I won't¦117707 not continue to rescue you.
\v 14 Go and cry¦117714 out to the gods that you've all chosen¦117719 for yourselves. They should¦117722 deliver¦117722 you all at the time¦117724 of your distress¦117725.”
\p
\v 15 Then¦117727 the \add ≈Israelis¦117730\add* said¦117727 to Yahweh¦117733, “We've sinned¦117734. You do to us according to all that is good¦117741 in your¦117742 eyes¦117742. Only please¦117745 rescue us today.”
\v 16 They removed the foreign¦117753 gods¦117752 from among¦117754 them, and they worshipped Yahweh¦117758 and \add ≈so he became¦117759 concerned\add* with Yisrael's¦117762 suffering.

\p
\v 1 Now¦117798 Yiftah¦117812 the Gileadite¦117799 was a fierce warrior, \add ≈but\add* he was a \add ≈prostitute's¦117807\add* son and his father¦117808 was Gilead¦117809.
\v 2 Gilead's¦117817 wife also gave birth¦117814 to sons for him, and \add when\add* those sons of the wife grew up, they drove¦117824 Yiftah¦117827 out and told him, “You¦117825 won't¦117830 \add ≈get any inheritance¦117832 from our father's¦117835 estate\add* because you're a son of another¦117840 woman.”
\v 3 So¦117843 Yiftah fled from the presence of his \add half-\add*brothers and he settled in the Tob¦117849 region. Unprincipled men¦117854 associated around Yiftah and went¦117856 around with him.
\p
\v 4 \add ≈Some time later\add*, the \add ≈Ammonites¦117865 battled against\add* Yisrael¦117868.
\v 5 and \add ≈that was when\add* the elders¦117881 of Gilead¦117882 went¦117880 to summon Yiftah¦117886 from the Tob¦117888 region.
\v 6 Then¦117890 \add ≈requested\add* Yiftah¦117891, “Come and be our commander¦117895 so we can fight¦117896 against the \add ≈Ammonites¦117898\add*.”
\p
\v 7 “Don't you all hate¦117906 me? Yiftah¦117901 asked \add *them\add*. “Didn't you yourselves drive¦117908 me out of my father's¦117910 house¦117909? \add ≈So¦117900\add* why have you all come¦117912 to me now when you have \add #troubles\add*?”
\p
\v 8 “\add ≈Well, true\add*,” the Gilead elders¦117920 \add ≈replied\add*, “\add But¦117919\add* now we've turned back to you. \add ≈So¦117919 join\add* with us and fight¦117931 against the \add ≈Ammonites¦117933\add*, and you'll become¦117934 commander over all of who lives in Gilead.”
\p
\v 9 “If you bring¦117949 me back to fight¦117952 against the \add ≈Ammonites¦117954\add*,” Yiftah¦117942 \add ≈asked\add* \add *them\add*, “and if Yahweh¦117956 \add ≈helps me defeat them\add*, \add is it correct that\add* I'll actually become¦117960 your leader?”
\p
\v 10 “Yahweh¦117971 will be a witness between¦117974 us,” the Gilead¦117967 elders¦117965 \add ≈responded¦117964\add*, “\add ≈that we'll most certainly do what you¦117978 just said¦117964\add*.”
\v 11 \add ≈So¦117982\add* Yiftah went¦117982 with the Gilead¦117987 elders¦117986, and the people¦117989 set him¦117990 as commander¦117993 and leader over themselves. (Yiftah had spoken¦117994 all those words¦118000 before Yahweh¦118002 at Mitspah.)
\p
\v 12 Then Yiftah¦118007 sent¦118006 messengers¦118008 to the \add ≈Ammonite\add* king¦118011, demanding, “What's happened with respect to me and to you, that you've come¦118022 against me to fight¦118024 over my land?”
\p
\v 13 The \add ≈Ammonite\add* king¦118028 \add ≈responded¦118027\add* to Yiftah's messengers¦118034, “Because \add ≈the Israelis\add* seized my land \add ≈when they¦118043 came¦118043\add* out of Egypt¦118044. It went¦118043 from the Arnon¦118045 \add river\add* up to the Yabbok¦118048 \add river\add*, and over to the Yordan¦118051 \add river\add*. Now return \add @the land\add* peaceably¦118055.”
\p
\v 14 Then¦118057 Yiftah sent¦118060 messengers¦118061 back to the \add ≈Ammonite\add* king¦118064
\v 15 to tell him, “Yiftah¦118072 \add ≈wants you to know that\add* Yisrael¦118076 didn't¦118073 take land from Moab¦118080 nor from \add ≈you Ammonites¦118085\add*.
\v 16 However in their coming up from Egypt¦118089, Yisrael¦118091 went¦118090 through the wilderness¦118092 as far as the \add ≈Red Sea\add* until arriving at Kadesh¦118099.
\v 17 When Yisrael \add (Israel)\add* sent messengers¦118103 to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please may \add #we\add* pass through your land,’ the king of Edom wouldn't listen¦118116. \add @Yisrael\add* likewise sent to the king of Moab¦118123, but he wasn't willing¦118126 \add either\add*, so Yisrael stayed at Kadesh¦118129.\x + \xo 11:17: \xt Num 20:14-21.\x*
\v 18 Then¦118131 \add #we\add* went through the wilderness¦118132 and turned away from the land of Edom¦118137 and the land of Moab, then went \add the long way\add* \add ≈around¦118133 the eastern border\add* of Moab. They camped¦118148 on the other¦118149 side of the Arnon \add river\add*, but they didn't¦118151 go within Moab's¦118141 borders, because the Arnon was the border of Moab.\x + \xo 11:18: \xt Num 21:4.\x*
\v 19 Yisrael¦118162 sent messengers¦118163 to the Amorite¦118169 King Sihon¦118166, the king of Heshbon¦118171 \add ≈and asked\add* him, ‘Please, let us pass through your land as far as \add #our\add* place.’\x + \xo 11:19-22: \xt Num 21:21-24.\x*
\v 20 But¦118183 \add King\add* Sihon¦118186 didn't¦118183 trust¦118185 Yisrael passing through within his border, \add ≈so\add* \add *he\add* assembled all of his people¦118198 together and they camped at Jahaz, and he battled with Yisrael.
\v 21 Then¦118206 Yisrael's¦118210 God¦118208, Yahweh¦118207, handed \add King\add* Sihon¦118213 and all his people¦118218 over to Yisrael and \add ≈we\add* defeated¦118221 them. Thus Yisrael took possession of all of the land of the Amorites¦118228 inhabiting that region—
\v 22 everything within the Amorite¦118238 territory¦118237 from the Arnon¦118239 \add river\add* to the Yabbok¦118242, and from the wilderness¦118245 as far as the Jordan¦118248.
\v 23 \add ≈So¦118250\add* since it was Yisrael's¦118254 God¦118253 Yahweh¦118251 that expelled the Amorites¦118258 out of the presence of his people¦118260 Yisrael, \add ≈do you actually think that you can take\add* it \add now\add*?
\v 24 Wouldn't you take possession if your god Chemosh¦118269, allowed you to? \add ≈So\add* \add too\add* all that our God¦118270 Yahweh¦118278 has dispossessed¦118277 ahead of us, we'll possess that.
\v 25 Are you really better¦118285 now than Zippor's¦118291 son, King Balak¦118288 of Moab¦118293? Did he dare contend with Yisrael¦118298 or did he ever wage war against them?\x + \xo 11:25: \xt Num 22:1-6.\x*
\v 26 Yisrael¦118306 lived¦118305 in Heshbon¦118307 and in its villages for three¦118319 hundred¦118320 years, and in Aroer¦118309 and in its villages, and in all the cities that are along the banks of the Arnon¦118318—\add ≈so\add* why didn't¦118323 you repossess \add <them\add* during that time¦118326?
\v 27 I haven't \add ≈done anything wrong to\add* you, \add ≈but\add* you're doing¦118335 wrong in dealing with me by fighting against me. Yahweh¦118341, the judge, will decide today between the \add ≈Israelis¦118346\add* and the \add ≈Ammonites¦118349\add*.”
\v 28 \add ≈But¦118351\add* the \add ≈Ammonite\add* king¦118353 didn't¦118351 \add ≈take any notice of Yiftah's message\add* to him.
\rem /s1 Jephthah's Vow
\p
\v 29 Then Yahweh's spirit¦118369 \add ≈empowered\add* Yiftah¦118368, and he passed through the Gilead and Manashsheh¦118377, and through Mizpah¦118381 of Gilead, and from \add *there\add* he passed through the \add ≈Ammonite region\add*,
\v 30 and \add *he\add* \add ≈made a promise\add* to Yahweh¦118392, “If¦118390 you really¦118396 give \add ≈me victory over the Ammonites¦118401\add*,

\v 32 \add ≈So\add* Yiftah¦118422 \add ≈went to the Ammonite territory\add* to fight¦118427 against them, and Yahweh¦118433 \add ≈enabled them to defeat them\add*.
\v 33 Then¦118436 he attacked them from Aroer¦118437 and as far as \add ≈the entrance¦118440\add* to Minnith¦118443, twenty¦118444 cities, and then up to Abel¦118447-Keramim¦118448, \add ≈slaughtering a huge¦118450 number\add*. \add ≈So¦118436\add* the \add ≈Ammonites¦118454\add* were subdued¦118452 by the presence of the \add ≈Israelis¦118457\add*.

\v 34 \add ≈When\add* Yiftah got back to his house in the Mizpah¦118462 area, look, his daughter was coming¦118468 out to meet him with tambourines¦118470 and with dancing¦118471. She was \add &their\add* only child¦118474—he didn't¦118475 have any son or daughter apart from her.
\v 35 When he saw¦118485 her, he tore his clothes¦118490 and said¦118491, “Oh no! My¦118499 daughter¦118493! Indeed, you've made me bow in grief, and you're¦118497 among those who cause me pain, because I \add ≈made a vow\add* to Yahweh¦118506 and I \add ≈can't¦118507 go back on it\add*.”
\p
\v 36 Then¦118511 she said¦118511 to him, “My father¦118513, you've \add ≈made a vow\add* to Yahweh. Do to me \add ≈whatever you promised\add*, after¦118526 what Yahweh has done for you—total vengeance¦118531 against¦118532 your¦118525 \add ≈Ammonite\add* enemies¦118532.”
\v 37 \add ≈But¦118536\add* she \add ≈asked\add* her¦118539 father¦118539, “\add ≈Just do this one thing¦118542\add* for me: release me for two¦118546 months¦118547, so I can go¦118548 away \add ≈and take some companions¦118558\add*.

\v 38 He \add ≈agreed\add* and then sent¦118563 her¦118569 away for two¦118565 months¦118566. She went¦118567 \add ≈with some\add* companions¦118569, and she wept on the hills \add ≈because she'd never be a mother\add*.
\v 39 Then¦118578 at the end of the two¦118581 months¦118582, she returned¦118583 to her father¦118586 and he carried out his vow with respect to her \add ≈so indeed\add* she \add ≈never had a chance to marry\add*.

\p
\v 1 Now the men of Efrayim¦118622 were summoned¦118637 and they passed northward and they said¦118625 to Yiftah¦118626, “Why did you pass¦118629 through in order to fight¦118631 against the \add ≈Ammonites¦118634\add*, but you didn't¦118636 call us to go¦118638 with you?

\v 4 Then¦118692 Yiftah¦118693 assembled all of the men of Gilead and \add ≈they battled against\add* Efrayim.

\v 5 The Gileadites captured¦118721 the crossing places of the Jordan along Efrayim. Then¦118721 when any of the survivors from Efrayim would say, “May I cross over,” the men¦118736 of Gilead¦118722 would \add ≈ask\add*, “Are you an Efrayimite?” If he said, “No,”
\v 6 then they'd \add ≈demand\add*, “\add ≈Now¦118758\add* say: Shibboleth¦118750.” But¦118745 if he said “Sibboleth¦118752” because he \add ≈didn't¦118753 have time to think\add* to pronounce¦118755 it correctly, they would seize¦118757 him and would slaughter him at those crossing places of the Yordan¦118763.

\rem /s1 Samson's Riddle; Samson's Marriage; Samson and the Woman from Timnah
\p
\v 1 \add One time when\add* Shimshon¦119392 went to Timnah¦119393, he \add ≈noticed\add* a young, Philistine woman¦119395 \add there\add*,
\v 2 and he went \add ≈back home\add* and he reported to his \add ≈parents\add*, “I saw a Philistine woman in Timnah¦119407 \add ≈that I'd like you to get for me as my\add* wife.”
\p
\v 3 “Isn't there a woman¦119427 among your relatives¦119423?” his \add ≈parents asked\add* him, “Or among all of \add #our\add* people¦119426? Why take a wife from the uncircumcised¦119435 Philistines¦119434?”
\p “Get her for me,” Shimshon¦119437 said to his father, “because \add ≈I feel she's right for me\add*.”
\p
\v 4 \add ≈Now his¦119452 parents\add* didn't¦119453 know that Yahweh \add ≈was arranging this\add*, because he was seeking¦119463 an opportunity against¦119464 the Philistines¦119464 who were \add ≈oppressing\add* Yisrael¦119469 at that time¦119465.
\p
\v 5 Then¦119481 Shimshon¦119473 went¦119477 to Timnah¦119476 with his¦119475 \add ≈parents\add* and \add when\add* they got to the vineyards¦119480 \add *there\add*, wow, a young¦119483 lion¦119483 roared \add ≈when it saw\add* him.
\v 6 Yahweh's¦119491 spirit¦119490 \add ≈rose up in\add* \add @Shimshon\add*, and he tore \add @the lion\add* to pieces \add ≈with his bare hands\add* like butchering a young¦119494 goat¦119494, \add ≈but\add* he didn't¦119496 \add ≈mention to his parents\add* what he'd done.
\p
\v 7 Then¦119511 he \add ≈continued on\add* and talked with the woman¦119508, and \add ≈he really liked her\add*.
\v 8 \add ≈Some¦119518 time later when he returned¦119513 for the wedding\add*, he turned¦119516 off the path to look for the lion's carcass, and \add ≈to his surprise\add*, a swarm¦119522 of bees had nested in the carcass and \add there was\add* honey¦119526 \add there\add*.
\v 9 He \add ≈filled his cupped hands¦119531 with honey¦119553\add*, and \add ≈continued\add* along—walking and eating¦119534 as he went to \add ≈where his parents were\add*. He even gave¦119542 some to them \add ≈to try\add*, but he didn't¦119545 tell them that he had scooped \add *it\add* out of the carcass¦119550 of a dead lion¦119551.
\v 10 Then¦119555 his father¦119556 went \add ≈to visit\add* the woman¦119559, and¦119560 \add ≈in the custom of the young¦119567 men¦119567\add* \add of the time\add*, Shimshon¦119562 \add ≈held\add* a party \add there¦119561\add*.
\v 11 \add ≈When¦119571\add* they saw¦119570 him, they brought thirty¦119573 close¦119574 friends to join him.\f + \fr 14:11 \ft Although we can understand the words here, we're not certain of the implications, or perhaps the cultural traditions. Did Shimshon appear too alone? Too intimidating? Or was it just bringing more friends for good food and drink?\f*
\v 12 Samson¦119580 said¦119578 to them, “Let me suggest a riddle for you all. If you're \add able to\add* explain it to me during the seven¦119592 days¦119593 of the party and \add ≈you've worked it out correctly\add*, I'll give¦119596 you all thirty linen¦119599 coats and thirty sets of clothes.
\v 13 But¦119604 if you all can't¦119606 \add ≈explain it\add* to me, then you yourselves must give¦119610 me thirty linen¦119614 coats and thirty sets of clothes.”
\p “\add ≈Okay, we're listening. Tell us the riddle¦119621\add*.” they \add ≈answered\add*.
\p
\v 14 \add ≈So¦119624\add* he said,
\q1 “Food came out of the eater¦119626,
\q1 ≈and sweetness¦119631 came out of the strong¦119629 one.”
\m But¦119624 three¦119636 days¦119637 later, they \add ≈still couldn't solve his\add* riddle¦119635.
\p
\v 15 Then¦119639 on the seventh day,\f + \fr 14:15 \ft The Greek Septuagint translation says ‘the \em fourth\em* day’, which perhaps might fit better into the narrative, but ‘seventh’ is in the Hebrew that we have and not necessarily incorrect.\f* they \add ≈pressured\add* Shimshon's¦119646 wife¦119644, “Get your husband \add ≈to tell you the answer of\add* the riddle¦119656, otherwise we'll burn¦119659 \add down\add* your father' house¦119663 and you \add as well\add*. \add ≈Did you invite¦119667 us to the party just to impoverish\add* us?”
\p
\v 16 Then¦119671 Shimshon's¦119673 wife¦119672 \add ≈put on a crying act\add* and said, “You must hate¦119678 me—you don't¦119679 love¦119680 me \add because\add* you've \add ≈created\add* a riddle \add ≈for my relatives\add*, yet you haven't \add ≈even told me the answer\add*.”
\p “Listen,” he \add ≈replied\add*, “I haven't \add even\add* \add ≈told my own parents\add*. Should I tell you?”
\v 17 She continued to cry beside him throughout the seven-day party, and then \add finally\add* on the seventh¦119700 day, he \add gave in and\add* told her because she kept nagging him, \add so in the end\add* she \add ≈was able to reveal the answer to her relatives\add*.
\v 18 Then¦119721 the men¦119723 of the city¦119724 said to \add @Shimshon\add* before¦119727 the sun¦119729 went¦119728 down on the seventh¦119726 day¦119725,
\q1 “What is sweeter¦119732 than honey¦119733?
\q1 And what's stronger¦119735 than a lion¦119736?”
\m \add ≈So¦119721\add* he said to them,
\q1 “If you all hadn't ploughed with my heifer¦119741,
\q1 you wouldn't have been able to solve my riddle¦119744.”
\p
\v 19 Then¦119746 Yahweh's spirit¦119748 \add ≈rose up in\add* him, and he went to Ashkelon¦119751 and killed¦119752 thirty¦119755 men \add there\add*. He took¦119757 their¦119760 possessions, and he gave¦119761 the changes of clothes for the riddle¦119764. \add ≈But¦119746 he was very angry, so\add* he went \add ≈back to his parent's home\add*.
\v 20 Then \add (unknown to Shimshon¦119774)\add*, \add *his\add* wife¦119773 \add ≈was given to the man who'd been\add* his close friend¦119777 and¦119772 companion¦119775.

\p
\v 1 Some days¦119781 later during the wheat¦119785 harvest¦119783, Shimshon¦119787 visited¦119786 his wife with a young¦119791 goat¦119791 \add as a present for the family, because\add* he said, “I'll go into the bedroom with my wife.” \add ≈But¦119780\add* her¦119802 father¦119802 wouldn't allow him to go in,
\v 2 and \add ≈pleaded\add*, “Truly, I \add ≈I thought¦119808 that you must\add* hate¦119811 her, so I gave¦119813 her to your close friend. \add ≈But¦119805 wouldn't\add* her younger¦119817 sister¦119816 be better \add anyway\add*? Please, \add ≈would you take her instead¦119824\add*.”
\p
\v 3 Shimshon¦119828 \add ≈responded¦119826\add*, “This time¦119830 I'm blameless concerning the Philistines¦119831 when I \add ≈cause trouble for\add* them.”
\v 4 Then¦119839 \add *he\add* went¦119839 and captured three¦119842 hundred¦119844 foxes¦119845 and \add ≈tied them in pairs\add*—tail to tail. He¦119840 took¦119846 torches, and \add ≈tied\add* one torch between¦119856 \add ≈the tails¦119859 of each pair\add*.
\v 5 He \add ≈lit\add* the torches¦119865 and let \add @the foxes\add* loose into the grain \add ≈crops\add* of the Philistines¦119868. As a result, he burnt both the standing grain \add plants\add* and also the \add harvested\add* \add #stacks\add* of sheaves, and even a vineyard¦119876 and an olive¦119877 orchard.
\v 6 \add ≈So¦119879\add* the Philistines¦119880 \add ≈asked\add*, “Who did this?”
\p “Shimshon,” they \add ≈replied\add*, “the son-in-law of the \add ≈man from Timnah\add*, because he took \add @Shimshon's\add* wife and gave¦119893 her to his close friend.” As a result, the Philistines went¦119895 \add to Timnah\add* and they burnt \add both\add* \add @the woman\add* and her father¦119901.
\v 7 Then¦119904 Shimshon¦119906 told them, “Since you actually did that \add horrible thing\add*, I certainly \add ≈won't\add* stop until I've avenged¦119914 myself¦119914 against you all.”
\v 8 Then¦119919 he attacked the Philistines and \add ≈crippled many of them, before going to\add* Etam's¦119931 rock¦119930 where he lived in a cave.

\v 9 \add ≈However\add*, the Philistine \add warriors\add* went¦119934 and camped¦119936 in Yehudah¦119937, and spread out \add around the town of\add* Lehi¦119939.
\v 10 \add ≈But¦119941\add* the men of Yehudah¦119943 \add ≈asked\add* \add <them\add*, “Why have you all come \add ≈here to attack\add* us?”
\p “We've come to \add ≈capture\add* Shimshon¦119951,” they \add ≈replied\add*. “To \add ≈give him some of his own back\add*.”
\v 11 Then¦119959 three¦119960 thousand¦119961 men from Yehudah¦119963 went¦119959 down to the cleft¦119966 of Etam's¦119968 rock¦119967, and told Shimshon¦119970, “Don't you realise that the Philistines¦119977 are ruling¦119975 over us? \add ≈Why are you causing more trouble for\add* us?”
\p “Just as they've done to me,” he \add ≈replied\add*, “so I've done to them.”
\p
\v 12 “We've come¦119995 \add ≈here to tie you up so we can hand\add* you over to the Philistines¦119999,” they said.
\p “\add Okay,\add*” Shimshon¦120002 \add ≈responded¦119992\add*. “\add But¦119992\add* promise me that you all won't \add ≈injure\add* me yourselves.”
\p
\v 13 “No, however, we'll certainly tie you up,” they \add ≈replied\add*, “and we'll hand you over to them. But¦120011 truly we won't¦120024 kill you.” Then¦120011 they tied him up with two new ropes¦120028 and brought¦120030 him up from the \add #rocks\add*.
\p
\v 14 \add ≈When they'd taken him\add* as far as Lehi¦120040, the Philistines¦120041 shouted¦120045 \add triumphantly\add* \add ≈when they saw\add* him.

\v 15 He saw a fresh¦120070 donkey's¦120069 jawbone¦120067 \add lying on the ground\add*, and he reached¦120071 out his hand¦120072 and \add ≈grabbed\add* it, and he slaughtered a thousand¦120077 \add Philistine\add* men with it.
\v 16 Then¦120080 Shimshon¦120081 \add ≈declared\add*,
\q1 “With a donkey's jawbone, one heap, two¦120085 heaps¦120085,

\m
\v 17 When he finished¦120093 \add ≈reciting that\add*, he hurled the jawbone \add ≈away\add*, and he called¦120098 that place¦120099 ‘Ramat¦120101-Lehi¦120102’ \add (which means ‘jawbone hill’)\add*.

\v 18 Then¦120104 he was very thirsty and cried out to Yahweh¦120109, “You yourself have given¦120112 your servant¦120115 this great victory¦120118, \add ≈but\add* now must I die¦120122 with this thirst and \add ≈get captured by those\add* uncircumcised¦120126 \add Philistines\add*?”

\p
\v 8 \add ≈So¦120315\add* the Philistine¦120319 leaders brought¦120315 her seven¦120320 green cords¦120321 that hadn't been dried¦120326, and¦120327 she tied him¦120327 up with them.
\v 9 Now she had an ambush¦120330 \add group\add* \add ≈ready\add* in the \add next\add* room when she said¦120334 to him, “The Philistines¦120336 are \add ≈here to get\add* you, Shimshon¦120338!” But¦120330 he tore the cords to shreds just like a strip of flax fiber¦120347 is torn to shreds when \add ≈the fire¦120349 reaches it\add*, \add ≈thus\add* \add ≈they didn't¦120350 find out\add* \add the secret of\add* his strength¦120352.
\v 10 Then¦120354 Delilah¦120355 said¦120354 to \add *him\add*, “Listen, you deceived¦120360 me and lied to me. Now tell me, please¦120368, \add ≈how could someone tie you up?\add*”

\v 11 “Actually, if they would tie me with new ropes¦120379 \add ≈which¦120381 have never been used\add*,” he \add ≈replied\add*, “I'd become¦120387 weak and be just like any other \add #man\add*.”
\p
\v 12 \add ≈So¦120392\add* Delilah¦120393 took¦120392 new cords and tied him up with them.

\v 24 When the people¦120653 saw him, they praised¦120654 their¦120657 god, saying, “Our¦120673 god has \add ≈helped us capture\add* our enemy¦120665—the devastator of our region who \add ≈killed so many of us\add*.”
\v 25 \add ≈Later in the celebration when the drink had liberated their¦120692 thinking\add*, they said¦120680, “Call for Shimshon so he can \add ≈entertain¦120683 us\add*.” So¦120675 they \add ≈brought\add* Shimshon in from the \add ≈prison¦120689\add* and \add taunted him\add* \add ≈to get them all laughing\add*. They made him stand¦120693 among the pillars¦120696 \add of the building\add*
\v 26 and \add *he\add* \add ≈asked\add* the servant¦120702 who was \add ≈guiding him\add* by the hand¦120704, “Place my hands against¦120717 the two pillars¦120711 holding up the building \add ≈so\add* I can lean on them.”
\v 27 The building was full of the men and the women, \add ≈including\add* the Philistine leaders. On the roof there¦120723 were about¦120730 three¦120730 thousand¦120731 men and women watching¦120734 the entertainment with Shimshon¦120736.
\p
\v 28 Then¦120738 Shimshon¦120739 called¦120738 out to Yahweh, “My master¦120744 Yahweh, please remember¦120746 me. Strengthen me please, just this time¦120751, oh God¦120753, so that I can avenge myself by one \add last\add* act of vengeance¦120755 on the Philistines¦120760 \add to make them pay for\add* my two¦120758 eyes¦120759.”
\v 29 Then¦120762 \add *he\add* took hold of the two¦120766 centre pillars¦120768 on which¦120770 the building depended, and \add ≈pressed out\add* against¦120775 them—one in his right¦120777 hand¦120777 and one in his left.
\v 30 Then¦120781 \add *he\add* \add ≈exclaimed\add*, “\add ≈Let me\add* die with the Philistines¦120787!” He stretched out with his strength and the building fell on \add &their\add* leaders and all of the people in it. \add ≈So¦120781\add* he killed more people at his death¦120807 than he had killed during his life.
\p
\v 31 Then¦120813 his brothers¦120814 and all his father's household¦120817 went¦120813 \add to Gaza\add* and carried \add @his body\add* back. They buried¦120823 him¦120824 between Zorah¦120826 and Eshtaol¦120828 in the burial place of his father Manoah¦120830. He had \add ≈helped\add* Yisrael¦120836 for twenty¦120837 years.

\p
\v 1 \add ≈Now\add* there was a man¦120843 named Micah¦120848 from the hill country of Ephraim¦120846
\v 2 who \add ≈admitted\add* to his mother, “Those \add ≈eleven\add* hundred¦120853 silver coins that were taken¦120856 from you—\add ≈when you made\add* a curse¦120861, and \add ≈even said it when I was listening\add*, \add well\add* listen, \add ≈I've got it all\add*—I took it myself.”
\p His mother said, “May Yahweh¦120875 bless¦120873 you, my son.”
\v 3 Then¦120877 he brought back the \add ≈eleven\add* hundred¦120882 silver coins to his mother and \add *she\add* \add ≈declared\add*, “I will certainly consecrate the money to Yahweh¦120892 \add ≈for my son's benefit\add*. \add ≈Take it and we'll use it to have one statue carved¦120896 and another cast\add*.”
\v 4 \add ≈So¦120902 after the money had been returned¦120902,\add* his mother gave two hundred¦120909 silver coins to a silversmith. He made a carved¦120914 figure and one cast \add from a mould\add*, and \add they were placed\add* in Micah's house¦120917.
\p
\v 5 Now¦120929 that Micah¦120921 had a \add ≈shrine with gods in it\add*, he made \add ≈some priestly robes\add* and \add ≈some household¦120923 gods\add*, and consecrated one of his sons¦120933 as his priest¦120937.
\v 6 In those¦120940 days¦120939, Yisrael¦120943 didn't¦120941 have a king¦120942—each \add ≈person\add* would do whatever \add ≈seemed right¦120945 to them\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add ≈Now\add* there¦120963 was a young¦120952 Levite¦120959 man¦120952 from the family of Yehudah\f + \fr 17:7 \ft Maybe one parent was from the tribe of Levi and one from Yehudah?\f* who'd been staying in Bethlehem (in Yehudah).
\v 8 \add *He\add* left Bethlehem to find another place to say, and on his way, he \add ≈ended up arriving\add* at Micah's¦120981 place in the Efrayimite hill country¦120975.
\v 9 “Where have you¦120990 come¦120990 from?” Micah¦120988 \add ≈asked\add* him.
\p “I'm a Levite¦120993 from Bethlehem in Yehudah¦120997,” he \add ≈replied\add*, “and I'm \add ≈trying to find a good place to stay¦121000 a while\add*.”
\p
\v 10 “Stay with me,” said¦121004 Micah¦121006, “and be like a father¦121012 and a priest¦121013 to me. I'll give¦121015 you ten¦121018 silver¦121019 coins a year¦121020 as well as \add ≈board and clothing\add*.” So¦121004 the Levite¦121025 \add man\add* went¦121024 in
\v 11 and¦121033 agreed¦121027 to stay¦121029 with \add @Micah\add*, \add eventually\add* becoming like one of Micah's¦121028 \add own\add* sons¦121037.
\v 12 Micah¦121040 ordained the Levite¦121044, and the young¦121048 man¦121048 became like a priest¦121049 to him, and lived in \add *his\add* house¦121051.
\v 13 “Now I know¦121057 that Yahweh¦121061 will \add ≈make everything go well\add* for me,” Micah¦121055 said¦121054, “because I have this Levite¦121067 as a priest¦121068.”

\s1 The Danites settle in Layish
\rem /s1 The Danites settle in Layish; Micah and the Tribe of Dan; Idolatry in the Tribe of Dan; The Migration of Dan
\p
\v 1 In those days, Yisrael¦121074 \add ≈didn't¦121072 have a\add* king. The tribe of Dan was looking¦121079 for¦121079 land to settle in, because up \add ≈until¦121089 then\add*, \add ≈they hadn't been able to claim their allocated region\add* among the Israeli tribes.
\v 2 \add ≈So\add* the Danites sent out five capable men (from Zorah¦121113 and from Eshtaol¦121114) to scout out the region and explore it. They had told them, “Go \add and\add* explore the area.” They came to the Efrayimite hill country¦121128, as far as Micah's¦121134 house¦121133, and spent¦121135 the night¦121135 there¦121136.
\v 3 They'd been near Micah's¦121142 house¦121141 \add ≈when\add* they recognized¦121144 the voice¦121147 of the young¦121148 Levite¦121149 man. So they'd \add ≈gone in\add* there¦121151 and they \add ≈asked\add* him, “Who brought¦121156 you here? What are you doing¦121161 in this \add place\add*? What do you \add ≈get\add* here?”
\p
\v 4 Then¦121168 he told them what Micah¦121174 had done for him, and how he'd hired¦121175 him to be like his priest¦121179.
\p
\v 5 \add ≈So¦121181\add* they¦121181 \add ≈asked\add* him, “Please find out from God¦121186 if we'll have success¦121188 on this expedition we're on.”
\p
\v 6 “\add ≈Continue on\add* in peace¦121199,” the priest¦121197 said¦121195. “Yahweh¦121201 has \add ≈prepared everything ahead\add* of you all.”
\p
\v 7 Then the five¦121210 men¦121211 left and \add ≈went¦121212 on\add* to Layish¦121213. They saw¦121214 that the people¦121217 \add ≈there\add* were living¦121221 in confidence \add ≈just like\add* the Tsidonians were—\add ≈peacefully¦121226\add* and \add feeling\add* secure¦121223. No one in the region was causing \add ≈trouble\add* for them and \add ≈they were very settled\add*. They were far away from the Tsidonians and \add ≈didn't¦121240 interact with others\add*.
\v 8 Then¦121247 they went¦121247 \add back\add* to their relatives in Tsorah¦121251 and Eshtaol¦121252, who \add ≈asked\add* them, “How \add ≈did it go\add*?”
\v 9 “Get \add ≈ready immediately\add*,” they \add ≈said\add*, “so that we can go \add to battle\add* against¦121262 them! Because we've seen the land and listen, it's incredible good. \add ≈Don't just still there\add*—you all \add ≈need to take action\add* to go in to \add ≈take possession¦121278 of\add* the land.
\p
\v 10 When you go¦121283, you'll all come¦121284 to a people¦121288 living \add ≈without suspicion of attack\add*, and the land is spacious in \add ≈all directions\add*, because God¦121296 \add ≈will hand it¦121295 over to you\add*—a place¦121298 where¦121299 there's no lack of anything that's on the earth.”
\p
\v 11 So¦121310 six¦121316 hundred¦121318 Danite¦121313 \add ≈warriors\add* left Tsorah¦121314 and¦121315 Eshtaol¦121315, carrying their weapons¦121321.
\v 12 They \add ≈set off\add* and¦121325 camped at Kiriat-Yearim in Yehudah¦121328. \add ≈That's why\add* they¦121332 call that place¦121333 Mahaneh¦121335-Dan \add (meaning ‘Dan's¦121337 camp’)\add* to this day¦121339—it's back behind¦121342 Kiriat-Yearim.
\v 13 From there¦121347, they¦121351 crossed over into the Efrayimite hill country¦121348, \add eventually\add* \add ≈arriving near\add* Micah's¦121355 house¦121354.
\p
\v 14 Then¦121357 the five¦121358 men¦121359 who had \add ≈been here previously\add* scouting out the land said¦121366 to their¦121369 \add ≈group\add*, “Do¦121365 you know¦121370 that there's¦121372 \add ≈a house¦121373 here\add* with a \add ≈gear for priests\add*, family idols, a carved¦121377 image, and a cast image? So¦121357 now, consider¦121380 what you should do.”
\v 15 So¦121385 they turned¦121385 \add ≈off the main path\add* and they came to the place with the young¦121392 Levite¦121393 man in Micah's¦121395 house, and they asked¦121396 about his welfare¦121399.
\v 16 The six¦121401 hundred¦121403 Danite men stayed outside at the gate, holding their¦121407 weapons¦121406.
\p
\v 17 The five men who'd gone to scout out the land went in \add around the back\add*. They took the carved¦121429 image, the priest's gear, the family idols, and the cast image, while the priest was standing¦121440 at the entrance¦121441 of the gate along with the six hundred¦121445 armed¦121447 men.
\v 18 When the priest¦121468 saw them bringing out \add ≈all the religious objects\add*, he \add ≈demanded\add*, “\add ≈What's going on\add*?”
\p
\v 19 “Stay quiet¦121475,” they told him. “Put your hand¦121478 over your mouth¦121481 and come with us, and be like a father¦121487 and a priest for us. Is it better¦121489 to be a priest for \add only\add* \add ≈one household¦121493\add*, or to be a priest for a \add whole\add* related tribe¦121499 in Yisrael¦121501?”
\v 20 The priest \add ≈liked that idea\add*, so he went¦121516 along with them—taking the \add ≈priestly gear\add* and the \add ≈household idols\add*, and the carved¦121515 image¦121515.
\p
\v 21 Then¦121520 they \add went back to the main path\add* and continued on their¦121532 way with the children, animals, and \add those carrying\add* the valuable property going in front¦121532.
\v 22 When they'd already gone \add ≈quite some\add* distance from Micah's¦121537 house¦121540, Micah and \add ≈his neighbours\add* gathered together¦121546, then the men¦121538 ran \add in a group\add* and caught up with the \add ≈Danites\add*.
\v 23 They called¦121568 \add ≈out to the Danites\add* who turned¦121560 around \add ≈to face¦121561 them\add* and \add ≈asked\add* Micah¦121563, “What's \add ≈the matter? Why has this group come\add* together¦121568?”
\v 24 “You all took my gods¦121573 that I made,” Micah \add ≈replied\add*, “And the priest¦121580. Then¦121570 you \add ≈disappeared and I had nothing left\add*. \add ≈So¦121570\add* how can you all \add ≈ask\add* me what \add ≈the matter is\add*!”
\p
\v 25 “\add ≈I wouldn't say too much if I was you,” he was told. “Otherwise some of our more fiery men¦121609 might start to get a bit hostile, then you'd bring about your own death, and that of your companions\add*!”
\v 26 Then¦121617 Micah¦121623 realised that they were too strong¦121626 for \add #them\add*, so \add #they\add* turned¦121629 back around and went home¦121633.
\rem /s1 The Danites Settle in Layish
\p \add ≈So¦121617\add* the Danites¦121620 continued onward,
\v 27 taking with them the things that Micah¦121641 had made, as well as his priest¦121644. They came¦121649 to Layish¦121652 where the unsuspecting¦121657 people¦121655 were living peaceably¦121656, and they slaughtered them with their swords¦121662 and burnt down the city¦121665.
\v 28 \add ≈No one came to rescue them\add* because it was \add ≈a long way\add* from Tsidon and \add ≈they did have much involvement with them anyway\add*. (\add @Layish\add* was in the valley¦121684 near Beyt-Rehob.) They rebuilt¦121689 the city¦121692 and then \add ≈moved into\add* it.
\v 29 They named the \add rebuilt\add* city Dan (instead of Layish¦121708) in honour of their¦121703 ancestor¦121703 Dan who was one of Yisrael's¦121706 sons.
\v 30 The Danites \add ≈mounted\add* the carved¦121721 image¦121721 for themselves \add to worship\add*. Yonatan (Gershom's¦121725 son from Manashsheh) became the priest for the Danites (and then his descendants¦121716 until¦121736 when the people were \add eventually\add* exiled from the region).
\v 31 \add ≈So¦121742\add* they set up the carved¦121746 image¦121746 that Micah¦121747 had made \add and worshipped it\add* \add ≈the whole time that God's¦121744 tent\add* was at Shiloh¦121757.

\v 1 In those¦121762 days¦121761 when there was no king¦121763 over Yisrael¦121765, there was a Levite¦121769 man who was staying in the remotest¦121771 parts of the hill country¦121772 of Efrayim¦121774. He took a slave-wife for himself from Bethlehem in Yehudah¦121782.
\v 2 \add ≈However\add*, \add *she\add* started sleeping around, and then she left him¦121788 and went¦121787 to her¦121792 father's¦121792 house¦121791 in Bethlehem \add where she ended up\add* staying for four¦121802 months¦121803.
\v 3 Then¦121805 her husband \add ≈got organised\add* and went¦121807 after¦121808 her—to \add ≈sweet-talk\add* her and persuade her to return with him. He took a young \add servant¦121815\add* man and a team of donkeys¦121818. She invited \add @her husband\add* into her father's house¦121820, and when \add *her\add* father saw¦121822 him, he was glad to meet him.
\v 4 His father-in-law (her father) insisted \add ≈on offering hospitality\add*, so they ate¦121838 and drank¦121839, and he stayed the night¦121840, and \add ended up\add* staying for three¦121836 days¦121837.
\v 5 Then¦121843 on the fourth¦121845 day¦121844, they got up early¦121846 and \add @the Levite\add* prepared to leave, but his father-in-law \add ≈urged him to eat before they left\add*.

\v 6 \add ≈So¦121864\add* the two of them ate¦121865 and drank¦121868 together¦121867, and then the woman's father¦121870 said¦121869, “Please stay \add another\add* night¦121878. \add ≈Relax and have a good time\add*.”
\p
\v 7 The man¦121883 got ready to leave, however his father-in-law persisted, so he stayed \add another\add* night¦121890 there¦121891.
\v 8 He got up early¦121893 in the morning¦121894 on the fifth¦121896 day to get ready to leave, but the father¦121900 of the young woman said, “\add ≈Get some energy first\add*.” So¦121893 they waited until¦121907 later in the day, and then the two of them ate.
\p
\v 9 \add ≈When\add* the man stood up to go with his slave-wife and his young man, his father-in-law said, “Listen, the day's \add ≈coming to an end soon\add*. Please stay the night.

\p
\v 10 \add ≈But¦121946\add* the man¦121949 from the tribe of Levi didn't¦121946 want to stay another night¦121950. He put saddles¦121963 on his two donkeys¦121962, and started to go with his slave-wife and his servant toward Yebus¦121957 city (now called Yerushalem¦121959).
\p
\v 11 They got close to Yebus¦121987 and the daylight had \add ≈mostly gone, so\add* the young man said¦121974 to his master¦121978, “Come, please¦121981, we should turn¦121982 aside¦121982 into this city¦121985 of the Yebusites so we can spend¦121989 the night¦121989 there.”

\v 25 But¦122289 the men¦122279 weren't willing¦122278 to listen¦122280 to him, so the man¦122283 \add ≈pushed his slave-wife out\add* to them and they \add ≈raped\add* her and abused¦122290 her the whole night¦122295 until¦122296 the morning¦122298, \add ≈when\add* they \add ≈discarded\add* her \add ≈as it began to\add* dawn.

\v 26 The woman¦122305 \add ≈managed to get herself back to\add* the house¦122310 where¦122313 her¦122315 master¦122315 was, and¦122308 \add ≈collapsed\add* at the entrance¦122309 until¦122317 \add ≈it got light¦122319\add*.
\v 27 \add ≈When\add* her master¦122322 got up and he opened¦122324 the door to go¦122328 \add ≈and continue on his trip\add*, look, his slave-wife had fallen at the entrance¦122334 and her hands¦122336 were on the threshold¦122339.
\v 28 “Get up,” he told her. “Let's go¦122344.” But¦122341 she didn't answer¦122346, so he put her on his donkey¦122350 and \add ≈headed\add* home¦122354.

\v 1 Then all the Israelis¦122410 from Dan¦122415 \add in the north\add* to Beer¦122418-Sheva \add in the south\add*, and \add even\add* from Gilead¦122421 \add across the Yordan\add*, came and assembled¦122411 before Yahweh¦122424 at Mitspah with \add ≈one single, united purpose\add*.
\v 2 The leaders of all the Israeli tribes¦122433 \add ≈also came out to show their agreement with\add* the assembly¦122435 of the people of the true God¦122437: four hundred¦122439 thousand¦122440 warriors all carrying swords¦122444.
\p
\v 3 \add ≈Meanwhile,\add* the \add ≈Benyamites\add* had heard¦122447 that the \add ≈Israelis¦122455\add* had gathered at Mitspah, and \add ≈everyone¦122453 asked\add*, “Explain how this wicked thing \add ≈came to happen\add*.”
\p
\v 4 \add ≈So¦122466\add* the Levite¦122468 man (the husband¦122469 of the woman¦122470 who had been murdered¦122471) answered¦122466, “I went¦122476 to the Gibeah¦122473 \add region\add* (in Benyamin¦122475) with my slave-wife to spend¦122479 the night¦122479.
\v 5 The citizens¦122483 of Gibeah¦122484 \add ≈conspired\add* \add together\add* against¦122482 me.

\v 6 I took¦122500 my slave-wife's \add body\add* back \add home\add* and cut her in pieces, and I sent¦122503 \add #them\add* out into every \add ≈section of the territory that God gave\add* Yisrael, because they've committed a heinous crime, and a disgrace to Yisrael.
\v 7 Listen, all of you Israelis¦122518, \add ≈what's your¦122516 advice? What should we do about it?\add*.”
\p
\v 8 All the people¦122528 \add ≈agreed together and¦122536\add* started saying, “We won't go¦122533 back to our \add ≈families\add*. We won't return to our houses¦122539.
\v 9 \add ≈rather\add* this is what we¦122545 must do to Gibeah¦122546: \add ≈choose by lot who will fight against\add* \add #them\add*.
\v 10 \add ≈Choose¦122574 a tenth of our men¦122552\add* to \add go and\add* get supplies \add for the other warriors to travel\add* to Gibeah¦122567 in Benyamin¦122568 \add after what they¦122566 did that\add* outraged¦122571 Yisrael¦122557.
\v 11 \add ≈So¦122576\add* all Yisrael¦122580 was united¦122586 together against that city¦122583.
\p
\v 12 Then the Israeli tribes sent¦122589 men¦122592 \add ≈across the Benyamite region to ask\add*, “What's this \add ≈evil thing\add* that's been done among you¦122603?

\v 14 \add *They\add* came¦122631 out of their cities¦122637 \add and assembled\add* at Gibeah¦122638 to the battle¦122640 against the \add ≈Israelis¦122644\add*.
\v 15 The \add ≈Benyamites \add* mobilised together twenty-six thousand¦122654 men from their cities¦122651 on that day¦122649, all carrying \add #swords\add*. In addition, seven¦122662 hundred¦122663 chosen¦122665 men had been mobilised from the Gibeah¦122660 \add region\add*.

\p
\v 18 The \add ≈Israelis¦122717\add* got ready and went¦122709 to Beyt-El and asked God¦122714, “Who should \add ≈lead us into\add* battle¦122723 with the \add ≈Benyamites\add*?”
\p “It should be Yehudah¦122730 \add ≈out front,\add*” Yahweh¦122729 \add ≈responded¦122715\add*.
\p
\v 19 \add ≈So¦122733\add* the \add ≈Israelis¦122736 set out\add* in the morning¦122737 and¦122738 made camp near Gibeah¦122741.
\v 20 Then \add *they\add* went¦122744 out to battle against the Benyamites—setting themselves up for the battle against them at Gibeah¦122759.
\p
\v 21 \add ≈But¦122761 the Benyamites led a surprise attack\add* out of Gibeah¦122767 and killed twenty-two thousand¦122774 of the \add ≈Israeli warriors\add*.
\v 22 \add ≈However the Israelis¦122781\add* strengthened themselves and¦122782 they¦122788 continued to set up for battle¦122784 \add ≈the next\add* day¦122790 at the \add ≈same\add* place¦122785.
\p
\v 23 Then¦122793 the \add ≈Israelis¦122796 assembled\add* and wept before Yahweh until¦122801 evening¦122803. They asked \add *him\add*, “Should \add #we\add* continue to attack and battle¦122809 against \add #our\add* \add ≈cousins the Benyamites\add*?”
\p “Go \add ≈back\add* against \add #them\add*,” Yahweh \add ≈replied\add*.
\v 24 \add ≈So the Israelis¦122824 went back to battle against the Benyamites\add* \add again\add* on the second¦122830 day¦122829.
\v 25 \add Again\add* the Benyamites came out from Gibeah¦122839, and \add this time\add* they killed eighteen¦122846 thousand¦122848 \add ≈Israeli swordsmen¦122855\add*.
\v 26 Then¦122857 the \add ≈Israeli warriors\add* and all the people¦122860 went¦122857 \add ≈back\add* to Beyt-El. They wept, and they sat there¦122871 before Yahweh. They fasted¦122874 that day¦122875 until¦122878 the evening¦122880, then they offered burnt¦122882 offerings and peace offerings to Yahweh.
\v 27 \add *They\add* asked Yahweh (because the box¦122893 containing the agreement with the true God¦122895 was there¦122892 in those¦122897 days¦122896
\v 28 and Finehas (son of Aharon's son Eleazar¦122902) was serving before¦122908 it in those¦122910 days¦122909), “Should \add #we\add* continue to go to the battle¦122915 once more against the our \add ≈cousins the Benyamites\add*, or should \add #we\add* stop?”
\p “Go \add ≈back\add* \add again\add*, because tomorrow¦122929 I'll give¦122930 \add ≈you victory over them\add*,” Yahweh¦122926 \add ≈responded¦122925\add*.
\p
\v 29 \add ≈So¦122933 the Israelis¦122934\add* placed \add ≈groups of warriors in ambush¦122935\add* \add all\add* around Gibeah¦122938.

\v 31 \add ≈When the Benyamites\add* came out from the city¦122968, they were lured away as they began¦122969 to strike down their enemies like the time before.

\v 32 Then¦122990 the \add ≈Benyamites\add* said, “\add ≈We're starting to defeat¦122993 them\add*, just \add ≈like before¦122995\add*.”
\p But¦122990 the \add ≈Israelis¦122998\add* had said, “Let's flee so that we can draw \add #them\add* away from the city¦123004 \add and\add* onto the roads.”
\v 33 Then¦123009 \add the main group\add* of \add ≈Israelis¦123012 retreated\add* and set up battle lines at Baal-Tamar, \add ≈as\add* the ones hiding in ambush¦123018 \add ≈made a surprise attack\add* from \add #their places¦123014\add* in Maareh-Gibeah.
\v 34 Ten thousand¦123030 \add ≈chosen¦123032 Israeli warriors\add* came¦123026 out in the sight of the Gibeah¦123028 region, and the battle¦123036 was fierce, \add ≈but\add* \add @the Benyamites\add* hadn't yet realised that \add ≈disaster¦123045 was about¦123043 to hit them\add*.
\v 35 Yahweh¦123049 \add helped the Israelis¦123058 to defeat¦123048 the Benyamites\add* that day¦123060, and \add ≈over\add* twenty-five thousand¦123064 \add Benyamite\add* \add ≈swordsmen¦123071 were killed\add*
\v 36 and \add *they\add* saw¦123073 that they were defeated¦123078.
\rem /s1 How the Israelites Won
\p The \add ≈Israelis¦123082\add* had given ground to the \add ≈Benyamites\add* because they had relied on the ambush¦123089 placed¦123083 around Gibeah¦123094.
\v 37 Then¦123096 the group hiding in ambush had rushed¦123098 out and spread out around Gibeah¦123101, then had gone in and \add ≈attacked the entire¦123107 city¦123109 with their swords¦123112\add*.
\v 38 Then¦123117 they¦123122 \add started a fire\add* as the \add ≈prearranged signal\add* was to be the rising¦123123 column of smoke¦123124 up out of the city¦123127.
\p
\v 39 Meanwhile the \add main\add* \add ≈Israeli force\add* had retreated, and the Benyamites had attacked and killed around thirty¦123141 men¦123138, thinking that they were winning like they'd done \add twice\add* before¦123149.
\v 40 \add ≈But¦123153 when\add* the pillar¦123159 of smoke began¦123154 to rise from the city, the \add ≈Benyamites¦123162\add* looked¦123161 behind¦123163 them and were shocked to see \add ≈their city going up in smoke\add*.
\v 41 Then¦123171 the \add main\add* \add ≈Israeli force\add* \add stopped retreating and¦123174\add* turned¦123173 back \add to attack again\add*. The \add ≈Benyamites\add* were horrified because \add #they\add* \add now\add* saw¦123178 that disaster¦123183 had struck them.
\v 42 They retreated¦123185 away from the \add ≈Israelis\add* into the wilderness¦123192, but the battle¦123193 overtook¦123194 \add #them\add*, plus \add @the Israelis\add* were coming \add back\add* out of the cities¦123196 \add ≈getting right in amongst them\add* \add to fight\add*.
\v 43 They surrounded¦123201 \add ≈the Benyamites as they tried to flee\add*, and easily ran \add #them\add* down as \add ≈they tried to escape from the Gibeah¦123210 region towards¦123211 the east\add*.
\v 44 Eighteen thousand¦123220 strong \add ≈Benyamite warriors were killed\add*,

\v 3 \add ≈asking\add*, “Oh Yahweh¦123354, God¦123355 of Yisrael \add (Israel)\add*, why has this happened¦123357 to Yisrael—for one tribe¦123363 \add ≈to be missing¦123360\add* from Yisrael \add ≈now\add*?”
\p
\v 4 The next day¦123367, the people¦123369 got up early¦123368 and built¦123370 an altar¦123373 there¦123372, and they offered up burnt¦123375 offerings and peace offerings.
\v 5 Then the \add ≈Israelis¦123381 asked\add*, “Among all the Israeli tribes¦123390 serving Yahweh, \add ≈was there any group who didn't join the battle\add*?” (\add They asked that\add* because they¦123379 had \add ≈previously decided that anyone¦123383 who didn't go to Mitspah to fight for Yahweh would\add* be put to death¦123409.)
\v 6 \add ≈Now the Israelis¦123413 felt sorry for their Benyamite cousins\add*, saying, “An \add entire\add* tribe¦123421 has been \add ≈hacked off\add* Yisrael¦123413 today.
\v 7 \add ≈How can we find wives for any\add* \add Benyamite\add* men that are left because we've promised to Yahweh not to give our daughters¦123438 to them \add ≈to marry\add*?
\p
\v 8 \add ≈So¦123441\add* they¦123441 \add ≈asked\add*, “Is there any \add ≈from our tribes¦123444\add* who didn't¦123447 \add ≈show up for\add* Yahweh¦123452 at Mitspah?” Then¦123441 listen, no one from Yabesh-Gilead had \add ≈joined their assembly¦123466\add* \add there\add*.
\v 9 (\add ≈When\add* the people¦123469 had \add ≈checked around\add* themselves, \add they'd realised that\add* no one from Yabesh¦123477-Gilead was there.)
\v 10 \add ≈So¦123479 the Israelis\add* sent¦123479 twelve thousand¦123486 \add ≈warriors\add* there¦123481, commanding¦123490 them to use their swords¦123502 to kill the inhabitants¦123497 of Yabesh¦123499-Gilead, including \add married\add* women¦123503 and \add ≈children\add*—
\v 11 \add specifically\add* they had to kill¦123520 every male, and every woman¦123515 who's \add ≈slept with\add* a male.
\v 12 \add That way\add* they discovered four¦123527 hundred¦123528 young¦123529 virgin¦123530 women among¦123523 the inhabitants¦123523 of Yabesh¦123526-Gilead, and brought¦123538 them \add back\add* to their camp at Shiloh¦123543 (in the Canaan¦123546 \add region\add*).
\p
\v 13 Then the entire¦123550 assembly sent¦123549 a message to the \add ≈Benyamites\add* at Rimmon¦123560 rock¦123559, \add ≈saying that they¦123553 were now ready for peace¦123563\add*.
\v 14 So¦123565 the \add ≈Benyamites\add* returned¦123565 and were given the young women from Yabesh¦123576-Gilead, \add ≈but\add* there wasn't enough of them.
\p
\v 15 The people¦123583 \add still\add* felt sorry for the \add ≈Benyamites\add*, because Yahweh¦123589 had \add ≈caused\add* a gap among Yisrael's¦123592 tribes¦123591,

\p
\v 19 They said¦123639, “Listen, there's a celebration for Yahweh¦123643 from time to time at Shiloh¦123644, which¦123648 is on the north¦123649 of Beyt-El, east of the road that goes¦123656 from Beyt-El uphill to Shechem¦123660, and on the south¦123661 of Lebonah¦123662.”
\v 20 \add ≈So¦123664\add* they \add ≈told the Benyamites\add*, “Go and¦123673 hide in those vineyards¦123674
