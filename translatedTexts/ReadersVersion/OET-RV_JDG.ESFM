\mt2 The accounts of
\mt1 Various Heroes and Guides
\mt3 commonly called ‘Judges’
\is1 Introduction
\ip This document commonly called ‘\bk Judges\bk*’, contains a collection of accounts of ‘\bk Various Heroes and Guides\bk*’ who helped to rescue the Israeli people from their oppressors. It covers the times from their invasion of Canaan through to just before their first king. Most of these heroes or guides were actually warriors. Shimshon (commonly called ‘Samson’) is the best-known of all of them, and his story can be read in chapters 13–16.
\ip From this document we can learn that Israel prospered when they obeyed Yahweh's instructions, but when they disobeyed, then God allowed other peoples and nations to oppress them. However, God is always ready and prepared to save his people whenever they turn away from their disobedience and return again to obeying the instructions that he'd given them.
\ip The previous book was named after the main character Yehoshua (Joshua) and the following books (Ruth and 1 Shemuel/Samuel) are named after their main characters, but this document with somewhere around a dozen important characters, has no single prominent character that it could be named after. Instead it's traditionally named ‘Judges’ in English because of around twenty uses of the Hebrew root ‘שָׁפַט’ (shafat) often in roots normally translated as ‘judged’. Despite that, there's not a single account in this document of these leaders judging the cases and conflicts of the common people. This dilemma offers two possible interpretations: 1/ that these leaders (often military leaders) did judge cases for the common people, but those details aren't recorded, or 2/ (which we've leaned more towards) that this Hebrew word has a wider range of meaning, and so we've leaned towards the English word ‘guided’ or ‘led’ in these contexts.

\p
\v 1 After Yehoshua's death¦111579, the Israelis¦111583 asked Yahweh, “\add ≈Which tribe should go¦111587 first¦111593 to attack the Canaanites\add*?”
\v 2 “Yehudah will go¦111600 first,” Yahweh \add ≈answered\add*. “Listen, I've \add ≈already determined that they'll conquer\add* the land.”
\p
\v 3 Then the Yehudah¦111609 \add leaders\add* said¦111608 to \add the tribe of\add* Simeon¦111610, “\add ≈Come\add* with \add #us\add* into the region that we've been allocated and we can fight¦111615 together against the Canaanites. Then we'll do the same in your area.” So¦111608 \add ≈the warriors from the two tribes worked together\add*.
\v 4 When \add *they\add* attacked, Yahweh \add ≈gave¦111629 them victory over\add* the Canaanites and the Perizzites and they killed ten¦111638 thousand¦111639 men at Bezek¦111637.
\v 5 They \add ≈confronted\add* Adoni-Bezek in Bezek and fought¦111648 against him (then eventually defeating¦111650 the Canaanites and the Perizzites).
\v 6 Adoni-Bezek \add tried to\add* flee but they chased him and captured him, cutting off his thumbs¦111668 and big¦111670 toes.
\v 7 “Seventy kings¦111678 had their thumbs¦111679 and big¦111681 toes chopped off,” Adoni-Bezek said¦111672, “and were gathering¦111684 scraps of food beneath my table¦111686. Just as I have done, so God¦111693 has repaid¦111690 to me.” Then¦111672 they took him to Yerushalem and he died¦111696 there¦111697.

\v 8 The warriors from Yehudah¦111703 attacked Yerushalem and captured¦111705 the city, killing the inhabitants and setting the city on fire.
\v 9 Then¦111717 they¦111718 fought against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country¦111724, in the southern \add wilderness\add*, and in the \add western\add* foothills.
\v 10 \add *They\add* also fought the Canaanites in Kiriath-Arba (now known as Hebron) and killed Sheshai¦111744, Ahiman, and Talmai.

\v 13 Otniel (son of Caleb's younger brother¦111790 Kenaz) captured¦111785 it so \add @Caleb\add* gave¦111794 his daughter¦111800 Aksah to him to become his wife.
\v 14 \add ≈After the wedding\add*, she urged¦111805 \add @Otniel\add* to ask¦111806 her father¦111809 for a field¦111810. When she got off her donkey¦111813, Caleb asked her, “What can I do for you?”
\v 15 “Give me a blessing¦111827,” she \add ≈requested\add*. “Although you've given¦111831 me land in the southern wilderness, give¦111832 me some springs of water¦111835 as well.” So¦111822 Caleb gave¦111836 her the upper¦111842 springs and the lower¦111845 springs.

\v 16 The Kenites (descendants of Mosheh's¦111851 father-in-law), left the city¦111853 of palm trees \add (Yericho)\add* and went with Yehudah's descendants to the southern wilderness¦111859 near Arad and lived with the people¦111868 \add there\add*.
\v 17 Then¦111870 the warriors of Yehudah¦111871 and Simeon¦111874 conquered the Canaanites living¦111880 at Tsefat and destroyed \add @the city¦111889\add*. \add Now\add* it's called¦111884 Hormah \add (which means ‘complete destruction’)\add*.
\v 18 \add *They\add* also captured Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron and \add all\add* their surrounding territories.

\v 19 Yahweh helped Yehudah¦111917 and¦111921 \add #they\add* took¦111921 possession¦111921 of the hill country¦111924, although they weren't able to conquer the people living down in the plains¦111931 because they had iron on their chariots¦111934.
\v 20 They gave¦111938 Hebron to Caleb just as Mosheh¦111945 had directed, and he dispossessed the three¦111950 sons¦111951 of the Anak from there¦111947.\x + \xo 1:20: \xt Josh 15:13-14.\x*
\v 21 \add ≈However\add* Benyamin's descendants didn't drive the Yebusites living¦111957 in Yerushalem out, so \add *they\add* have lived among the Benyamites in Yerushalem to this day¦111971.\x + \xo 1:21: \xt Josh 15:63; 2Sam 5:6; 1Ch 11:4.\x*

\v 22 Also Yosef's descendants attacked Bethel, and Yahweh \add ≈helped\add* them.
\v 23 \add *They\add* sent spies out to Bethel (previously called Luz)
\v 24 and \add *they\add* saw a man coming¦112004 out of the city and told him, “Please¦112012 show us an entrance¦112014 into the city, and we'll be kind to you.”
\v 25 \add ≈So¦112020\add* he showed¦112020 them an entrance¦112023, and \add @their warriors\add* \add attacked and\add* \add ≈killed the inhabitants\add*, but they let the man¦112034 and his family¦112039 go¦112040 free.
\v 26 The man¦112043 went¦112042 to the land of the Hittites and \add ≈founded\add* a city¦112047 and called it Luz (which it's still called to this day¦112054).

\p
\v 27 \add ≈However\add* Manashsheh's \add descendants\add* didn't drive out those living in Beyt-Shan, Taanak, Dor, Yibleam, or Meggidon, because the Canaanites were determined¦112098 \add ≈to keep living there\add*.\x + \xo 1:27-28: \xt Josh 17:11-13.\x*
\v 28 (\add Later,\add* the Israelis became¦112107 stronger¦112107 and \add ≈they forced¦112113 the Canaanites to work for them as their slaves\add*, but they didn't drive¦112114 them out.)
\v 29 Nor did Efraim's \add descendants\add* drive the Canaanites out of Gezer, so \add *they\add* continued to live among them.\x + \xo 1:29: \xt Josh 16:10.\x*
\p
\v 30 Zebulun's \add descendants\add* didn't drive the Canaanites out of Kitron or Nahalol, so they¦112147 continued to live among them and were \add ≈forced¦112148 to work as slaves\add*.
\p
\v 31 Asher's \add descendants\add* didn't drive out those who were living in Akko, Tsidon, Ahlab, Aczib¦112167, Helbah, Afek, or Rehob,
\v 32 \add ≈So¦112178\add* the Asherites lived with the Canaanites who \add still\add* lived in the region because they didn't drive¦112186 them out.
\p
\v 33 Naftali's \add descendants\add* didn't drive out those who were living in Beyt-Shemesh or Beyt-Anat, so they¦112216 continued to live among them and were \add ≈forced¦112218 to work as slaves\add*.
\p
\v 34 The Amorites forced Dan's descendants¦112225 to live in the hill country¦112228, because they didn't allow¦112232 them to come¦112233 down to the plains¦112234.
\v 35 The Amorites were determined¦112236 to live¦112238 at Mt. Heres, in Ayyalon and Shaalbim (but when Yosef's descendants became stronger, they¦112249 forced¦112250 the Amorites \add ≈to work as slaves\add*).

\rem /s1 The Angel of the Lord at Bochim; Result of disobedience; Israel's Disobedience; The Angel of the Lord at Bokim; The Lord's Messenger Comes to Bokim
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh's messenger went from Gilgal¦112266 to Bokim and told \add the Israelis\add*, “I brought¦112272 you all out of Egypt¦112274 and led you here to this land that I promised to your ancestors¦112282. I had said that I wouldn't ever break¦112286 my agreement with you all,

\v 3 \add ≈So¦112310\add* I'm telling you that I won't drive¦112314 your enemies out ahead of you, \add ≈but\add* they'll be like thorns in your sides¦112319 and you'll all end up being enslaved to their¦112320 \add ≈idols\add*.”
\v 4 When Yahweh's messenger finished saying that, the people wept loudly,
\v 5 so they called¦112346 that place¦112349 Bokim¦112351 \add (which means ‘weeping’)\add* and¦112352 they \add ≈offered sacrifices¦112352\add* to Yahweh¦112355 there¦112354.

\v 6 Then Yehoshua dismissed¦112358 the people and the \add ≈tribes went to their various regions\add* to take possession¦112369 of the land.

\v 13 They abandoned¦112502 Yahweh and \add ≈worshipped\add* the Baal and Ashtarot \add idols\add*.

\rem /s1 The Lord Rescues His People; The first judges
\p
\v 16 Then¦112555 Yahweh¦112556 \add ≈gave them\add* leaders\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Traditionally called ‘judges’ in most English translations, but that modern term doesn't fit their various functions in this account at all well.

\v 17 \add ≈However\add* they wouldn't listen¦112567 to \add those\add* leaders \add either\add*—continuing to prostitute¦112569 themselves to other¦112572 gods¦112571 and bowing down to idols. They rapidly turned¦112575 away from their ancestors' ways and \add ≈showed no interest\add* in obeying Yahweh's instructions.
\v 18 Whenever Yahweh \add ≈gave them\add* a leader, he would \add ≈support\add* that leader and would save them from their enemies¦112606 during that leader's life, because¦112592 he pitied \add @the people\add* when they groaned¦112614 \add ≈from being tormented and oppressed¦112616\add*.
\v 19 \add ≈But¦112619 then at the death of that leader\add*, they would turn back and behave more corruptly¦112624 than their ancestors¦112625—following other¦112629 gods¦112628 and bowing¦112631 down to \add @idols\add*. They didn't stop any of their evil activities or their shameless behaviour
\v 20 \add ≈so\add* Yahweh \add ≈was very angry\add* at Israel and said¦112644, “This nation¦112648 has broken the agreement that I made with their¦112657 ancestors¦112657 and haven't \add ≈done what I told them to\add*.
\v 21 I won't keep driving the people groups away that \add remained\add* when Yehoshua died¦112677,

\v 7 \add ≈So\add* the \add ≈Israelis¦112827 did things considered evil¦112830 by\add* Yahweh and they¦112824 forgot¦112833 about their¦112837 god¦112837 Yahweh, \add ≈instead\add* serving the Baal and Asherot \add idols\add*.
\v 8 \add Because of that,\add* Yahweh \add ≈was very angry\add* with Israel, so he \add ≈handed them over to\add* King Cushan-Rishathaim of Aram-Naharaim \add (Mesopotamia)\add*. The Israelis¦112861 served¦112858 him for eight¦112866 years¦112867

\v 12 \add Once\add* again the Israelis¦112931 started doing¦112932 things considered evil by Yahweh, \add ≈so\add* because of that, \add *he\add* strengthened¦112936 King Eglon of Moab against Israel.
\v 13 \add @King Eglon\add* \add ≈enlisted warriors from\add* the Ammonites¦112962 and the Amalekites¦112963, and they attacked Israel and captured \add Yericho,\add* the city¦112972 of palm trees,

\v 15 \add ≈But\add* the Israelis cried¦112990 out to Yahweh, \add *he\add* \add ≈sent them\add* a \add ≈leader to rescue\add* them: the left-hander Ehud, son of Gera the Benyamite. The Israelis sent him to carry the tribute¦113020 payment to King Eglon of Moab.
\v 16 \add ≈Now\add* Ehud had made himself a double-edged sword¦113028—a short one about half a metre long—and he strapped it to his right¦113040 thigh¦113039 beneath his clothes¦113037.
\v 17 Then¦113042 he presented¦113042 the tribute¦113045 to King Eglon of Moab, who was a very fat man¦113050,
\v 18 and after leaving \add for home\add*, he sent¦113061 off the people¦113064 who'd \add actually\add* carried¦113065 it \add all\add*.
\v 19 Then¦113068 from the stone quarries \add that they'd reached\add* near Gilgal¦113076, he returned¦113069 and told the king that he had a private message¦113078 for him. The king told his attendants¦113090 to be quiet then sent them out of the room.
\p
\v 20 \add ≈So¦113093\add* Ehud approached where the king was sitting¦113099 alone¦113105 in the coolness of his upper room and told him, “I have a message¦113108 for you¦113112 from God¦113110.” \add @The king\add* stood up from \add &his\add* seat¦113115
\v 21 and then Ehud reached¦113117 with his left hand¦113121 and pulled the sword from his right¦113129 thigh¦113128 and plunged it into \add @the king's\add* belly¦113131.
\v 22 Even the handle went in after¦113137 the blade and the fat closed¦113139 up over the handle because \add @Ehud\add* didn't pull the sword out of his belly¦113147.

\v 24 After¦113173 he'd left, the servants¦113162 came¦113163 and found the doors¦113166 locked¦113168, so they thought \add @the king\add* must be relieving himself¦113175 in \add *there\add*.
\v 25 They¦113194 waited¦113179 until¦113180 they \add ≈became worried\add* that he hadn't opened the doors¦113189, \add ≈so\add* they got a key and opened \add them\add*, only to find their¦113199 master¦113199 lying¦113200 dead¦113202 on the floor.
\p
\v 26 While \add @the servants\add* had been waiting, Ehud had escaped and passed¦113209 beyond the quarries, then fleeing to Seirah.
\v 27 When he got there, he blew a trumpet¦113219 \add ≈throughout\add* the Efraimite hill country, and \add so\add* the \add ≈Israelis¦113226 assembled under his direction\add* down \add in the valley\add*.
\v 28 “Follow after me,” he told them, “because Yahweh \add ≈will enable you all to defeat your enemies¦113243, the Moabites\add*.” So¦113233 they followed him down to the Yordan \add river\add* and captured the fords¦113253 opposite Moab, thus preventing anyone¦113259 from crossing¦113260.

\v 3 The Israelis¦113352 cried¦113349 out to Yahweh because \add @Sisera\add* had nine¦113357 hundred¦113358 chariots¦113359 with iron on them, and he cruelly¦113369 oppressed¦113364 \add *them\add* for twenty¦113370 years.
\p
\v 4 \add ≈Now\add* the prophetess¦113376 Deborah (Lappidot's¦113378 wife¦113377) was leading Israel at that time¦113384.
\v 5 She \add ≈would sit\add* under¦113389 the palm tree¦113391 between Ramah and Bethel (in the Efraimite hill country¦113399), and \add ≈people¦113403\add* would come to her \add ≈to have their disputes settled\add*.
\v 6 \add One day\add* she summoned Barak (Abinoam's son from Kedesh in Naftali) and told him, “Israel's God¦113421, Yahweh commands¦113418 you¦113429 to draft ten¦113430 thousand¦113431 men from Naftali and Zebulun and \add assemble\add* at Mt. Tabor.
\v 7 Yahweh will lure King Yabin's army commander¦113447, Sisera bring his warriors and chariots¦113453 to the Kishon river, and \add ≈Yahweh will enable you¦113439 to defeat them there\add*.”
\p
\v 8 “I'll go if you'll come with me,” \add ≈replied\add* Barak, “\add ≈but\add* if you won't come with me, I won't go.”
\p
\v 9 “I'll certainly¦113477 go with you,” she said, “but it won't be you that's honoured \add ≈afterwards\add*, but \add rather\add* Yahweh \add ≈will use a woman¦113494 to defeat\add* Sisera.” So¦113476 Deborah \add ≈accompanied\add* Barak to Kedesh.
\v 10 \add There\add* \add *he\add* summoned¦113511 \add warriors from\add* Zebulun and Naftali and ten¦113522 thousand¦113523 men came, and \add they all went¦113525 together\add* with Deborah \add to Mt. Tabor\add*.
\p
\v 11 \add ≈Now\add* Heber had moved \add with his wife Yael and their family\add* \add ≈away from the other\add* Kenites (and from Mosheh's¦113536 father-in-law Hobab's descendants) and set up his tent by the oak tree¦113541 at Zaanannim near Kedesh.
\p
\v 12 \add ≈When\add* Sisera was told that Barak (Abinoam's son) had gone to Mt. Tabor,
\v 13 \add *he\add* assembled his warriors and their nine¦113569 hundred¦113570 chariots¦113568 (with iron on them) \add and went from\add* Haroshet-Haggoyim to the Kishon riverbed.
\p
\v 14 “Get going,” Deborah told Barak, “because it's today that Yahweh has gone ahead of you and \add ≈will help you defeat\add* Sisera.” So¦113587 Barak led his ten¦113611 thousand¦113612 warriors down from Mt. Tabor.
\v 15 Then¦113616 Yahweh \add ≈caused Sisera and all his warriors and chariots¦113625 to be confused as Barak advanced\add*, \add ≈so\add* Sisera jumped down from his chariot¦113639 and took off on foot¦113641.
\v 16 Barak pursued¦113644 the men and chariots¦113646 as far as Haroshet-Haggoyim and they killed them all—not a single one survived.
\p
\v 17 \add ≈But¦113666\add* Sisera had fled on foot¦113668 \add and ran to\add* Yael's tent (Heber the Kenite's wife¦113673) because there was peace¦113680 between King Yabin of Hatsor and the house¦113687 of Heber the Kenite.
\v 18 Yael went out to meet Sisera and told him, “\add ≈Stop and rest\add*, my master¦113698. \add ≈Stop and rest here\add*. Don't be afraid¦113703.” So¦113691 he turned¦113704 and went into her tent, and she covered¦113707 him with a blanket.
\p
\v 19 “I'm thirsty¦113719,” he said. “Could you get me a little¦113715 water¦113717 to drink.” \add @Yael\add* opened¦113720 a goatskin container and gave him milk to drink, then she covered¦113726 him \add again\add*.
\v 20 “Stand at the tent doorway,” he said¦113728, “and if anyone comes and asks¦113738 you if \add ≈you've seen a man\add*, say¦113744, ‘No.’ ”
\p
\v 21 Then¦113747 Heber's wife¦113749 Yael got a hammer¦113759 and a tent peg and \add ≈crept in silently\add*, driving the peg through his temple¦113768 and pounding it into the ground,. He'd been tired and was sleeping¦113773 soundly, and \add ≈it killed him\add*.
\v 22 \add ≈Meanwhile\add* Barak \add ≈had been searching for\add* Sisera, and Yael went out to meet him. “Come in here,” she told him, “and I'll show you the man¦113792 you've been searching for.” He \add ≈followed her into the tent\add* and wow—Sisera was lying¦113801 there dead with the peg \add still\add* through his temple¦113804.
\p
\v 23 \add ≈So¦113806\add* that day¦113808 God¦113807 defeated Canaanite King Yabin's \add army\add* \add ≈in front¦113815 of the Israelis¦113817\add*,
\v 24 and as \add *they\add* became stronger¦113825 against \add *him\add*, they destroyed King Yabin of Canaan¦113830.

\v 2 and the \add ≈Midianites oppressed\add* \add *them\add* badly. \add ≈It was so bad that the Israelis¦114286\add* made dens for themselves up in the hills, in caves¦114294, and \add ≈in small, fortified settlements\add*.
\v 3 Whenever the Israelis planted a crop, the Midianites or the Amalekites¦114306, or eastern groups would¦114304 attack \add #them\add*.
\v 4 They would set up their camps around them and destroy¦114315 the crops as far away as Gaza—they¦114326 left \add ≈nothing for the Israelis to eat\add*, and \add ≡no\add* \add #sheep, cattle, or donkeys¦114331\add*.
\v 5 It was like a swarm¦114340 of locusts¦114342 when they'd \add all\add* come with their tents¦114337 and their livestock¦114335—you couldn't even count their camels¦114345! They entered the region to \add ≈totally ravage\add* it¦114350.

\v 7 When the Israelis¦114372 cried¦114369 out to Yahweh concerning Midian¦114378,

\p
\v 13 “With me, my master¦114482?” Gideon¦114480 \add ≈asked\add*. “If Yahweh is with us, then why's all of this happened¦114487 to us?

\p
\v 14 Then¦114513 Yahweh turned¦114513 to him and said¦114516, “Use your strength¦114518 to set Israel free from the grasp of Midian¦114525. Haven't I sent you \add to do that\add*?”
\p
\v 15 “Please, my master¦114532,” Gideon replied, “how could \em I\em* save Israel? Look, my clan is the weakest¦114540 in Manashsheh and¦114542 \add on top of that\add*, I'm the youngest¦114543 in my \add ≈family\add*.”

\p
\v 1 Then Gideon¦115105 (\add also known as\add* Yerub-Baal) and the warriors with him got up early¦115102 and \add went to\add* Harod spring. The Midianite camp was north¦115121 of them in the valley¦115124 below¦115122 the Moreh hill.
\p
\v 2 Then¦115126 Yahweh told Gideon¦115130, “\add ≈You've got too many warriors with you¦115134 for me to give¦115135 victory over the Midianites, because what if Israel takes the glory for themselves thinking that their¦115139 own strength saved them\add*.
\v 3 \add ≈So¦115150\add* tell the men that anyone who's afraid or trembling¦115159 can leave¦115161 Mt. Gilead¦115163 and go¦115160 back home.” Twenty-two thousand of them went back, leaving \add only\add* ten¦115171 thousand.\x + \xo 7:3: \xt Deu 20:8.\x*

\v 4 “That's still¦115181 too many,” Yahweh told Gideon¦115180. “Bring them down to the \add ≈spring\add* and I'll short-list them there¦115191. Whoever I tell you to go with you, can do so, but anyone that I say won't go with you, won't go.”
\v 5 \add ≈So¦115217\add* he took them down to the water and Yahweh told \add *him\add*, “\add ≈Separate out those\add* who lap up the water with \add #their tongues¦115234\add* like a dog would, \add ≈along with those\add* who kneel down to drink¦115251.”
\v 6 \add ≈It turned out\add* that \add only\add* three¦115260 hundred¦115261 men used their hands¦115256 to bring water to their mouths¦115259, and all the rest knelt down to drink¦115270 the water.
\v 7 “I'll \add ≈rescue\add* you¦115284 all from Midian¦115288 with the three¦115279 hundred¦115280 men who lapped¦115282 the water \add from their hands\add*,” Yahweh told Gideon¦115278. “Let all the others go¦115293 back to their homes.”
\v 8 Then¦115297 the three-hundred warriors \add ≈collected\add* the food and ram's horns from the others before \add @Gideon\add* sent¦115310 the others back to their own \add ≈homes\add*.
\p The Midian¦115319 camp was below \add #them\add* \add down\add* in the valley¦115323
\v 9 and during the night¦115327 Yahweh told \add @Gideon\add*, “\add ≈Get ready\add* and \add lead them\add* down into the camp, because I have \add ≈made you victorious\add*.
\v 10 \add ≈But¦115339\add* if you're afraid¦115341 to \add ≈attack\add*, take your¦115347 servant¦115347 Purah¦115346 down to \add &their\add* camp
\v 11 and you'll hear¦115352 what they're saying, then \add ≈you'll have the courage to go¦115359 down\add* \add and attack\add* the camp.” So¦115352 \add @Gideon\add* and his servant¦115364 Purah¦115363 went \add quietly\add* down to the \add ≈unit\add* at the edge of the camp.
\p
\v 12 The Midianites and Amalekites¦115373 and others from the east covered the valley¦115380 like a swarm of locusts¦115381. \add Even\add* their¦115383 camels¦115383 were as numerous as sand grains on the beach.
\v 13 \add ≈When\add* Gideon¦115394 \add ≈got close\add*, a man was telling his companion about his dream. “Listen,” he said, “I had a dream and wow, a round¦115406 loaf of barley¦115409 bread¦115408 was tumbling¦115410 into \add ≈our\add* camp. It came as far as the tent and struck¦115417 it so that it fell and turned¦115419 it upside down, and collapsed¦115421 \add completely\add*.”
\p
\v 14 “\add ≈That could only be\add* the sword¦115432 of Yoash's son Gideon¦115433 from Israel,” \add ≈the other man¦115437\add* replied. “The true God¦115440 has \add ≈caused Midian¦115444 and all of the camp to be defeated by him\add*.”
\p
\v 15 When Gideon¦115454 heard¦115453 the account of the dream¦115458 and its interpretation¦115461, he \add ≈thanked God\add*, then \add #they\add* returned¦115463 to \add *their\add* camp and \add ≈commanded\add*, “\add ≈Get ready to go\add* because Yahweh has given¦115472 \add ≈you all victory over\add* the Midianite camp.”
\v 16 Then¦115481 he divided¦115480 the three hundred¦115485 men into three units, and gave¦115489 each of them rams' horns and \add clay\add* jars with \add burning\add* torches¦115496 inside them,
\v 17 and instructed them, “Watch me and do what I do. See, when I get to the edge of \add &their\add* camp, do the same as me.
\v 18 When I blow the ram's horn trumpet¦115519, all of you¦115529 with horns should blow them and \add everyone\add* will shout, ‘For Yahweh and for Gideon¦115536!’ ”
\p
\v 19 \add ≈When\add* Gideon and the hundred¦115541 men with him got to the edge of the camp, it was the beginning¦115549 of the middle¦115551 nightwatch and \add ≈the fresh guards had just gotten into their places\add*. \add @Gideon and his unit\add* blew their trumpets¦115559 and smashed¦115560 the jars \add ≈that they¦115554 were carrying\add*.
\v 20 Then¦115565 \add all\add* three¦115566 units blew the trumpets and smashed their jars. They held the torches¦115576 in their left hands and the trumpets in their right¦115579 hands, and they shouted out, “A sword¦115583 for Yahweh and for Gideon¦115585.”
\v 21 Then¦115587 everyone¦115588 stood¦115587 in their place¦115589 around the camp, \add ≈but\add* the \add Midianite\add* army cried¦115596 out \add in alarm\add* and \add ≈took off\add*.
\v 22 When the three¦115601 hundred¦115603 ram's horns \add ≈sounded\add*, Yahweh \add ≈caused the Midianite army to start fighting each other with their swords¦115608\add*, and the army fled as far as Beyt-Shittah (towards Tsererah) and towards the border¦115622 of Abel-Meholah (towards Tabbat).
\p
\v 23 Then¦115630 the \add ≈warriors\add* from Naftali, Asher, and from all of Manashsheh were summoned \add ≈to help with pursuing¦115643 the Midianites\add*.

\p
\v 2 “What \add ≈have I achieved compared¦115752 to you¦115752 guys\add*?” \add ≈answered\add* \add @Gideon\add*. “Aren't the \add ≈seconds\add* of Efraim's grapes better than the \add whole\add* grape¦115757 harvest¦115757 of Abiezer¦115758?

\p

\v 5 \add When they arrived at the town\add* of Sukkot, Gideon asked the \add ≈leaders\add*, “Please give¦115803 my men¦115801 some bread¦115807 to eat because they're exhausted¦115813, \add ≈but we're chasing¦115816\add* Zebah and Zalmunna, the Midianite kings¦115820.”
\p
\v 6 \add ≈However, the Sukkot officials¦115824 asked\add* \add cautiously\add*, “\add ≈Do you already have Zebah and Zalmunna in your grasp\add* that we¦115833 should give¦115833 \add ≈food\add* to \em your\em* army?”
\p
\v 7 “Let me assure you all,” Gideon¦115838 \add ≈responded¦115837\add*, “that when Yahweh has \add ≈helped us capture Zebah and Zalmunna\add*, I will rip off your¦115852 flesh¦115852 with the wilderness¦115856 thorns¦115855 and briers¦115859.”
\p
\v 8 From there they climbed up to Penuel, and he \add ≈asked them for food in a similar manner\add*, and the \add ≈leaders there\add* responded similarly to the \add ≈leaders\add* of Sukkot.
\v 9 \add ≈So¦115876\add* he said¦115876 to the men¦115879 of Penuel as well, “When I return¦115882 \add ≈safely\add*, I'll tear down this tower¦115887.”
\p
\v 10 \add ≈Now\add* Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with around fifteen thousand warriors—all that remained out of all of that allied Midianite camp of eastern people¦115903, because one hundred¦115907 and twenty¦115908 thousand of their¦115894 warriors had already been killed.
\v 11 Gideon¦115915 approached them \add unexpectedly\add* via the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck their camp when they were feeling secure¦115928.

\v 13 The Gideon¦115954 (Yoash's son) \add and his warriors\add* returned¦115953 from battle¦115960, going through the Heres pass.
\v 14 He captured¦115964 a young¦115966 man from Sukkot and questioned¦115969 him—writing down the names of the seventy-seven leaders and elders¦115978 of Sukkot.

\v 16 He took¦116007 the city¦116011 elders¦116010 and \add had them punished\add* with wilderness¦116015 thorns¦116014 and briers¦116018 \add ≈to teach them a lesson\add*,

\v 19 “They were my brothers¦116060—the sons¦116061 of my mother¦116063,” he said¦116059. “As Yahweh lives, if only you had let them live¦116069, I wouldn't have killed¦116072 you.”

\v 26 Now the weight¦116197 of the gold earrings¦116198 of gold came to twenty kilograms, and then there were the crescent-shaped ornaments¦116210, the pendants¦116211, the dyed purple¦116213 garments¦116212 that the Midianite kings¦116215 had been wearing, as well as the collars that had been around their¦116223 camels' necks¦116222.

\v 21 Then¦116792 Yotam fled away and escaped and went¦116795 to Be'er and settled there¦116798 away from the presence of his \add half-\add*brother Abimelek¦116800.
\rem /s1 Shechem's Revolt against Abimelech; The Downfall of Abimelech
\p
\v 22 Abimelek¦116805 ruled¦116804 over Israel¦116808 for three¦116809 years¦116810,
\v 23 then God¦116813 sent¦116812 an evil¦116815 spirit¦116814 between \add *him\add* and the citizens of Shekem¦116820, \add ≈so\add* the citizens \add *there\add* dealt¦116821 treacherously¦116821 with Abimelek¦116817.
\v 24 The violent¦116828 treatment of \add ≈Gideon's\add* seventy¦116829 sons¦116830 \add ≈kept getting brought up\add*, and by \add ≈it was all blamed on\add* their brother¦116838 Abimelech who had killed¦116840 them, and on \add those of\add* Shekem's citizens¦116843 who \add ≈assisted him in\add* the killing of his brothers¦116854.
\v 25 \add ≈So¦116856\add* the Shekem¦116859 citizens¦116858 placed men in ambush¦116860 along the tops of the hills \add ≈to get him\add*, \add ≈but\add* they robbed¦116864 everyone¦116866 who went passed¦116870 them along the road¦116872, and \add so\add* it was reported¦116873 to Abimelech¦116865.
\p
\v 26 Then Gaal (Ebed's son) came¦116877 along with his brothers and \add ≈moved into\add* Shekem¦116884, and the citizens¦116888 \add *there\add* \add began to\add* trust \add #them\add*.
\v 27 They went out into the field¦116892, and they picked grapes from their vineyards¦116896 and pressed them. They celebrated harvest festivals and they went into the house¦116901 of their gods, then they ate¦116903 and drank¦116904, and they cursed¦116905 Abimelek¦116908.
\v 28 Then¦116910 Gaal (Ebed's son) said¦116910, “Who's Abimelek, and who's Shekem, that we should serve him? Isn't \add @Abimelek\add* \add ≈Gideon's\add* son, and Zebul is his deputy? Serve the descendants of Shekem's father¦116935 Hamor, \add ≈but\add* why should we serve \add @Abimelek\add*?
\v 29 Who will \add ≈fight with me to defeat those\add* people¦116945 and depose Abimelek? Then¦116941 he said¦116952 to Abimelek, ‘\add ≈Gather\add* your army and come¦116956 \add ≈and fight\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 30 When Zebul, the prince of the city¦116962, heard \add ≈what Ga'al (Ebed's son) had said\add*, \add ≈he got very angry\add*
\v 31 and he sent¦116973 messengers¦116974 to Abimelek¦116977 in secret, saying, “Listen, Ebed's son Gaal and his brothers are coming¦116986 to Shekem¦116987, and wow, they're inciting the city¦116992 against¦116993 you.
\v 32 You and the people who're with you \add ≈should go out at night¦116997\add* and lie in ambush in the countryside¦117004.
\v 33 Then¦117006 \add ≈when the sun¦117009 rises\add* in the morning¦117007, you all should set out early¦117010 and spread out in an attack against¦117023 the city¦117014. Keep watch, then when \add @Ga'al\add* and the people with him are coming out toward you \add to fight\add*, then you \add can overpower them and\add* \add ≈treat him however you think fit\add*.”
\p
\v 34 \add ≈So\add* Abimelek¦117032 and all the people with him \add ≈went out in the night¦117039\add* and they set up four¦117044 units in an ambush against Shekem¦117043.
\v 35 \add In the morning,\add* Ga'al (Ebed's son) went¦117047 out and he stood at the entrance¦117053 of the city¦117055 gate. Then¦117047 Abimelek¦117057 and \add ≈his men stood up from their hiding places\add*.
\v 36 \add ≈When\add* Ga'al saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, a group of people is coming¦117079 down from the tops of the hills!”
\p “You are seeing¦117089 the shadow¦117086 of the hills as men¦117090,” Zebul \add ≈responded¦117072\add*.
\p
\v 37 \add ≈But\add* Ga'al said again¦117094, “Look, groups of people¦117100 are coming down from beside the \add ≈top of the hill\add*, and \add ≈another group\add* is coming from the way of the ‘oak of the diviners’.”
\p
\v 38 Then¦117113 Zebul said to him, “\add ≈Well, you were the one who\add* said, ‘Who is Abimelek¦117122 that we should serve¦117124 him?’ Aren't these the people who you \add ≈were scorning\add*? Indeed now, go¦117131 out and fight¦117135 against \add #them\add*.”
\v 39 \add ≈So\add* Ga'al went¦117139 out in front¦117141 of Shekem's citizens¦117142 and fought¦117144 against Abimelek¦117145.
\v 40 Abimelek¦117148 pursued him, and he \add ≈had to flee away from him\add*. Many \add of their men\add* fell fatally¦117152 wounded¦117152 as far as the entrance¦117156 of the city gate.
\v 41 Then¦117159 Abimelek¦117160 settled in Arumah, \add ≈but\add* Zebul drove¦117162 Ga'al and his brothers away from living in Shekem¦117171.
\p
\v 42 Now it so happened that the next day¦117174, the people¦117176 \add of Shekem\add* went¦117175 out into the countryside¦117177, and \add ≈it was reported¦117178\add* to Abimelek¦117179.
\v 43 So¦117181 he took¦117181 \add ≈his men\add* and split them into three¦117186 units. Then¦117181 he waited in ambush in the countryside¦117189. When¦117182 he saw¦117190 and wow, the people¦117192 were going¦117193 out of the city¦117196, then he \add ≈attacked\add* and killed¦117199 them.
\v 44 Abimelek¦117201 and the units that were with him had spread out and they stood¦117206 at the entrance¦117207 of the city¦117209 gate, and two¦117210 units spread out against everyone who was in the field¦117218 and killed¦117219 them.
\v 45 Abimelek¦117221 \add ≈spent that whole day attacking Shekem\add*. He captured¦117227 the city and \add #they\add* killed¦117237 the people¦117233 who were in it. Then¦117221 he tore \add *it\add* down, and scattered salt on \add @the land\add*.
\p
\v 46 When all the lords of the tower of Shekem¦117252 heard¦117246, they went¦117253 into the citadel of the temple for El-Berit,
\v 47 \add ≈but\add* it was reported to Abimelek¦117262 that all the lords of the Shekem tower had gathered¦117264 there.
\v 48 So¦117272 Abimelek¦117273 and all the people with him, went up to Mt. Tsalmon. \add *He\add* took¦117284 axes and cut a branch¦117291 down from the trees, then lifted¦117293 it onto his shoulder¦117297 and said¦117298 to the people who were with him, “\add ≈What I just did, you all quickly do the same\add*.”
\v 49 So¦117312 all the people also each cut off a branch¦117319 and then \add ≈followed¦117320\add* Abimelek¦117322. They piled them on top of the underground chamber, \add ≈and that's how\add* they burnt out the underground chamber. As a result, all the distinguished people in the tower of Shekem¦117340 also died—about¦117341 a thousand¦117341 men and women¦117343.
\p
\v 50 Then Abimelek¦117347 went¦117346 to Tebets and set up camp around \add *the city\add* and captured¦117353 it.
\v 51 \add ≈But¦117355\add* there¦117363 was a strong tower in the middle¦117359 of the city, so all of the men and the women¦117367 and all the prominent citizens¦117369 fled to it. \add ≈Once they were all in, they barricaded it up\add* and they went up onto the tower roof.
\v 52 Then¦117379 Abimelek¦117380 \add and his men\add* approached¦117386 the tower and fought¦117384 against it, and he came¦117379 in as close as the tower entrance¦117389 in order to \add ≈set fire¦117392 to it\add*,
\v 53 \add ≈but\add* a woman¦117395 threw¦117394 an upper¦117398 millstone down onto Abimelek's¦117404 head and¦117403 it crushed¦117403 his skull¦117406.\x + \xo 9:53: \xt 2Sam 11:21.\x*
\v 54 Then¦117408 he cried out hurriedly to the young man bearing his armour, “Draw out your sword¦117419 and put me to death, \add ≈because I don't want it to be said afterwards that I was killed¦117426 by\add* a woman¦117425.” \add ≈So¦117408\add* his young man stabbed him so that he died.
\v 55 \add ≈When\add* the \add ≈Israeli warriors\add* saw¦117431 that Abimelek¦117437 was dead¦117436, they¦117431 all returned to their own homes.
\p
\v 56 Thus God¦117443 avenged the evil¦117445 of Abimelek¦117446 that he had done to his father¦117449 \add Gideon\add* by killing¦117450 his seventy¦117453 brothers¦117454,
\v 57 and God¦117463 \add ≈caused all the evil¦117459 done by Shekem's men¦117460\add* to return back upon their¦117464 own heads¦117464, and the curse¦117467 of \add ≈Gideon's\add* \add youngest\add* son Yotam, came¦117465 true on them.

\v 6 The \add ≈Israelis¦117555\add* continued to do \add ≈what Yahweh considered evil\add*: they worshipped the Ba'als, the Ashtorets, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the sons of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines¦117586. They forsook Yahweh and didn't serve¦117560 him.
\v 7 Yahweh \add ≈was very angry with\add* Israel, so he \add ≈allowed the Philistines¦117602 and the Ammonites¦117605 to harass them\add*.
\v 8 They shattered and oppressed the \add ≈Israelis\add* that year¦117613, \add ≈but it went on\add* for eighteen¦117615 years for all the \add ≈Israelis\add* who were on the opposite side of the Yordan in the land of the Amorites, which¦117629 is in the Gilead¦117630.
\v 9 Then¦117632 the \add ≈Ammonites¦117635\add* also crossed¦117632 over the Yordan¦117638 to fight¦117639 against Yehudah, against Benyamin, and against the \add ≈half-tribe\add* of Efraim¦117645.
\p This caused incredible distress¦117646 for the \add ≈Israelis\add*
\v 10 \add ≈so\add* \add *they\add* cried¦117650 out to Yahweh, “We have sinned¦117657 against you, because¦117659 we have forsaken¦117660 our God¦117663 and we have served¦117664 the Ba'als.”
\p
\v 11 “Wasn't it from the Egyptians,” Yahweh \add ≈responded¦117670\add*, “from the Amorites, from the \add ≈Ammonites¦117684\add*, from the Philistines¦117687,
\v 12 the Sidonians and Amalek and Maon, when they oppressed¦117692 you that you cried¦117694 out to me, and I \add ≈rescued you all from them\add*?
\v 13 \add ≈Yet\add* you've all abandoned me and served¦117703 other¦117705 gods¦117704. Therefore, I won't not continue to rescue you.
\v 14 Go and cry¦117714 out to the gods that you've all chosen¦117719 for yourselves. They should¦117722 deliver¦117722 you all at the time¦117724 of your distress¦117725.”
\p
\v 15 Then¦117727 the \add ≈Israelis¦117730\add* said¦117727 to Yahweh, “We've sinned¦117734. You do to us according to all that is good¦117741 in your¦117742 eyes¦117742. Only please¦117745 rescue us today.”
\v 16 They removed the foreign¦117753 gods¦117752 from among¦117754 them, and they worshipped Yahweh and \add ≈so he became¦117759 concerned\add* with Israel's suffering.

\v 3 So¦117843 Yiftah fled from the presence of his \add half-\add*brothers and he settled in the Tob region. Unprincipled men¦117854 associated around Yiftah and went¦117856 around with him.
\p

\v 7 “Don't you all hate¦117906 me? Yiftah¦117901 asked \add *them\add*. “Didn't you yourselves drive¦117908 me out of my father's¦117910 house¦117909? \add ≈So¦117900\add* why have you all come¦117912 to me now when you have \add #troubles\add*?”

\p
\v 9 “If you bring¦117949 me back to fight¦117952 against the \add ≈Ammonites¦117954\add*,” Yiftah¦117942 \add ≈asked\add* \add *them\add*, “and if Yahweh \add ≈helps me defeat them\add*, \add is it correct that\add* I'll actually become¦117960 your leader?”

\v 34 \add ≈When\add* Yiftah got back to his house in the Mizpah area, look, his daughter was coming¦118468 out to meet him with tambourines¦118470 and with dancing¦118471. She was \add &their\add* only child—he didn't have any son or daughter apart from her.
\v 35 When he saw¦118485 her, he tore his clothes¦118490 and said¦118491, “Oh no! My daughter¦118493! Indeed, you've made me bow in grief, and you're¦118497 among those who cause me pain, because I \add ≈made a vow\add* to Yahweh and I \add ≈can't go back on it\add*.”
\p
\v 36 Then¦118511 she said¦118511 to him, “My father¦118513, you've \add ≈made a vow\add* to Yahweh. Do to me \add ≈whatever you promised\add*, after¦118526 what Yahweh has done for you—total vengeance¦118531 against¦118532 your \add ≈Ammonite\add* enemies¦118532.”
\v 37 \add ≈But¦118536\add* she \add ≈asked\add* her father¦118539, “\add ≈Just do this one thing¦118542\add* for me: release me for two¦118546 months¦118547, so I can go¦118548 away \add ≈and take some companions¦118558\add*. I'll fall prostrate on the hills and I'll weep \add ≈because I'll never have a chance to marry\add*.”
\v 38 He \add ≈agreed\add* and then sent¦118563 her away for two¦118565 months¦118566. She went¦118567 \add ≈with some\add* companions¦118569, and she wept on the hills \add ≈because she'd never be a mother\add*.
\v 39 Then¦118578 at the end of the two¦118581 months¦118582, she returned¦118583 to her father¦118586 and he carried out his vow with respect to her \add ≈so indeed\add* she \add ≈never had a chance to marry\add*.

\p
\v 1 Now the men of Efraim¦118622 were summoned¦118637 and they passed northward and they said¦118625 to Yiftah¦118626, “Why did you pass¦118629 through in order to fight¦118631 against the \add ≈Ammonites¦118634\add*, but you didn't call us to go¦118638 with you?

\v 2 “\add ≈I've been involved in very intense disputes\add*—my people¦118652 against the \add ≈Ammonites¦118655\add*,” Yiftah¦118646 told them. “When I summoned you all, you didn't \add come and\add* rescue me from \add ≈them\add*.
\v 3 \add ≈When\add* I could see that you weren't coming to assist, I took¦118673 my life¦118674 into my own hands¦118675.

\v 4 Then¦118692 Yiftah¦118693 assembled all of the men of Gilead and \add ≈they battled against\add* Efraim.

\v 5 The Gileadites captured¦118721 the crossing places of the Jordan along Efraim. Then¦118721 when any of the survivors from Efraim would say, “May I cross over,” the men¦118736 of Gilead¦118722 would \add ≈ask\add*, “Are you an Efraimite?” If he said, “No,”
\v 6 then they'd \add ≈demand\add*, “\add ≈Now¦118758\add* say: Shibboleth¦118750.” But¦118745 if he said “Sibboleth¦118752” because he \add ≈didn't have time to think\add* to pronounce¦118755 it correctly, they would seize¦118757 him and would slaughter him at those crossing places of the Yordan¦118763.

\v 1 The \add ≈Israelis¦118896\add* continued to do \add ≈what Yahweh considered as evil¦118898\add*, so \add *he\add* \add ≈allowed the Philistines¦118905 to oppress them\add* for forty¦118906 years.

\p
\v 6 Then¦118989 the woman¦118990 went¦118989 and explained to her husband, “A man of God came to me. \add ≈He looked like one of God's messengers\add*—\add ≈extremely terrifying\add*—\add ≈so\add* I didn't \add like to\add* ask him \add ≈where¦119006 he'd come from\add*, and he didn't \add ≈tell\add* me his name.
\v 7 Then¦119018 he told me, ‘You're definitely pregnant¦119021 and you'll \add ≈give birth to\add* a son.

\p
\v 8 Then Manoah¦119053 prayed¦119052 to Yahweh¦119059, “Oh please, my master¦119059, please let the man¦119060 of God¦119061 that you sent¦119063 \add before\add*, come¦119064 \add back\add* to us again¦119067 so he can instruct us about what we must do for this boy¦119073 who's going to be born.”
\v 9 The true God listened¦119076 to Manoah's \add ≈request\add*, and God's messenger came¦119080 to the woman¦119086 again¦119083 when she¦119087 was sitting¦119088 \add out\add* in the field¦119089, \add ≈but\add* her husband¦119091 Manoah wasn't with her,

\v 3 “Isn't there a woman¦119427 among your relatives¦119423?” his \add ≈parents asked\add* him, “Or among all of \add #our\add* people¦119426? Why take a wife from the uncircumcised¦119435 Philistines¦119434?”
\p “Get her for me,” Shimshon¦119437 said to his father, “because \add ≈I feel she's right for me\add*.”
\p
\v 4 \add ≈Now his parents\add* didn't know that Yahweh \add ≈was arranging this\add*, because he was seeking¦119463 an opportunity against¦119464 the Philistines¦119464 who were \add ≈oppressing\add* Israel at that time¦119465.
\p
\v 5 Then Shimshon¦119473 went¦119477 to Timnah with his \add ≈parents\add* and \add when\add* they got to the vineyards¦119480 \add *there\add*, wow, a young¦119483 lion¦119483 roared \add ≈when it saw\add* him.
\v 6 Yahweh's spirit¦119490 \add ≈rose up in\add* \add @Shimshon\add*, and he tore \add @the lion\add* to pieces \add ≈with his bare hands\add* like butchering a young¦119494 goat¦119494, \add ≈but\add* he didn't \add ≈mention to his parents\add* what he'd done.

\v 8 \add ≈Some¦119518 time later when he returned¦119513 for the wedding\add*, he turned¦119516 off the path to look for the lion's carcass, and \add ≈to his surprise\add*, a swarm¦119522 of bees had nested in the carcass and \add there was\add* honey¦119526 \add there\add*.
\v 9 He \add ≈filled his cupped hands¦119531 with honey¦119553\add*, and \add ≈continued\add* along—walking and eating¦119534 as he went to \add ≈where his parents were\add*.

\p “Listen,” he \add ≈replied\add*, “I haven't \add even\add* \add ≈told my own parents\add*. Should I tell you?”
\v 17 She continued to cry beside him throughout the seven-day party, and then \add finally\add* on the seventh¦119700 day, he \add gave in and\add* told her because she kept nagging him, \add so in the end\add* she \add ≈was able to reveal the answer to her relatives\add*.
\v 18 Then¦119721 the men¦119723 of the city¦119724 said to \add @Shimshon\add* before¦119727 the sun¦119729 went¦119728 down on the seventh¦119726 day¦119725,

\v 9 \add ≈However\add*, the Philistine \add warriors\add* went¦119934 and camped¦119936 in Yehudah, and spread out \add around the town of\add* Lehi.
\v 10 \add ≈But¦119941\add* the men of Yehudah¦119943 \add ≈asked\add* \add <them\add*, “Why have you all come \add ≈here to attack\add* us?”
\p “We've come to \add ≈capture\add* Shimshon¦119951,” they \add ≈replied\add*. “To \add ≈give him some of his own back\add*.”
\v 11 Then¦119959 three¦119960 thousand¦119961 men from Yehudah¦119963 went¦119959 down to the cleft¦119966 of Etam's rock¦119967, and told Shimshon¦119970, “Don't you realise that the Philistines¦119977 are ruling¦119975 over us? \add ≈Why are you causing more trouble for\add* us?”
\p “Just as they've done to me,” he \add ≈replied\add*, “so I've done to them.”
\p
\v 12 “We've come¦119995 \add ≈here to tie you up so we can hand\add* you over to the Philistines¦119999,” they said.
\p “\add Ok,\add*” Shimshon¦120002 \add ≈responded¦119992\add*. “\add But¦119992\add* promise me that you all won't \add ≈injure\add* me yourselves.”
\p
\v 13 “No, however, we'll certainly tie you up,” they \add ≈replied\add*, “and we'll hand you over to them. But¦120011 truly we won't kill you.” Then¦120011 they tied him up with two new ropes¦120028 and brought¦120030 him up from the \add #rocks\add*.
\p
\v 14 \add ≈When they'd taken him\add* as far as Lehi, the Philistines¦120041 shouted¦120045 \add triumphantly\add* \add ≈when they saw\add* him. Then Yahweh's spirit¦120049 \add ≈rose in\add* \add @Shimshon\add* and the ropes¦120052 \add ≈around\add* his arms \add ≈just seemed as weak as burnt\add* flax stalks \add ≈when he simply snapped them off him\add*.
\v 15 He saw a fresh¦120070 donkey's¦120069 jawbone¦120067 \add lying on the ground\add*, and he reached¦120071 out his hand¦120072 and \add ≈grabbed\add* it, and he slaughtered a thousand¦120077 \add Philistine\add* men with it.
\v 16 Then¦120080 Shimshon¦120081 \add ≈declared\add*,
\q1 “With a donkey's jawbone, one heap, two¦120085 heaps¦120085,
\q1 ≈with a donkey's jawbone, I've slaughtered a thousand¦120089 men.”
\m
\v 17 When he finished¦120093 \add ≈reciting that\add*, he hurled the jawbone \add ≈away\add*, and he called¦120098 that place¦120099 ‘Ramat-Lehi’ \add (which means ‘jawbone hill’)\add*.
\p
\v 18 Then¦120104 he was very thirsty and cried out to Yahweh, “You yourself have given¦120112 your servant¦120115 this great victory¦120118, \add ≈but\add* now must I die¦120122 with this thirst and \add ≈get captured by those\add* uncircumcised¦120126 \add Philistines\add*?”
\v 19 \add ≈So¦120128\add* God¦120129 split¦120128 open the \add little\add* hollow¦120132 that's at Lehi, and water¦120138 came out of it.

\v 5 The Philistine leaders came¦120253 to her and \add ≈requested\add*, “Make him open up. \add ≈Find out what makes him strong, and how we can beat\add* him, so that we can tie him up \add ≈to keep him in our power\add*. Then¦120253 we'll each give¦120271 you one thousand¦120275 one hundred¦120276 silver¦120277 coins.”
\p
\v 6 So¦120279 Delilah¦120280 \add ≈asked\add* Shimshon¦120283, “Please, tell me \add ≈what makes you so strong\add*, and how \add ≈could someone tie you up to keep you in their power\add*?”
\p
\v 7 “If they'd tie me up with seven¦120301 green cords¦120302 that haven't been dried¦120307,” \add *he\add* \add ≈replied\add*, “then I'd become¦120310 weak and be just like any other \add #man\add*.”
\p
\v 8 \add ≈So¦120315\add* the Philistine¦120319 leaders brought¦120315 her seven¦120320 green cords¦120321 that hadn't been dried¦120326, and¦120327 she tied him¦120327 up with them.
\v 9 Now she had an ambush¦120330 \add group\add* \add ≈ready\add* in the \add next\add* room when she said¦120334 to him, “The Philistines¦120336 are \add ≈here to get\add* you, Shimshon¦120338!” But¦120330 he tore the cords to shreds just like a strip of flax fiber¦120347 is torn to shreds when \add ≈the fire¦120349 reaches it\add*, \add ≈thus\add* \add ≈they didn't find out\add* \add the secret of\add* his strength¦120352.
\v 10 Then¦120354 Delilah¦120355 said¦120354 to \add *him\add*, “Listen, you deceived¦120360 me and lied to me. Now tell me, please¦120368, \add ≈how could someone tie you up?\add*”
\p
\v 11 “Actually, if they would tie me with new ropes¦120379 \add ≈which¦120381 have never been used\add*,” he \add ≈replied\add*, “I'd become¦120387 weak and be just like any other \add #man\add*.”
\p
\v 12 \add ≈So¦120392\add* Delilah¦120393 took¦120392 new cords and tied him up with them.

But¦120392 he flicked them off his arms like they were \add just\add* thread¦120409.
\p
\v 13 Then¦120411 Delilah¦120412 said to Shimshon¦120415, “\add ≈So far\add* you've \add just\add* \add ≈been deceitful¦120419 to\add* me and told me lies. \add Now\add* Tell me how you can be tied up.”

\p
\v 14 \add ≈So¦120442\add* \add she did it and\add* fastened¦120442 it with the pin, and \add ≈called out\add*, “The Philistines¦120446 are \add ≈here to get\add* you, Shimshon¦120448!” Then¦120442 he woke up and \add ≈ripped\add* out the pin, the loom, and \add his hair from\add* the fabric.
\p
\v 15 Then¦120460 she said¦120460 to him, “How can you say¦120463, ‘I love¦120464 you,’ when your heart¦120465 isn't with me? You've \add ≈been deceitful¦120471 to\add* me three¦120469 times¦120470 \add now\add*, and you haven't revealed to me \add ≈the secret of your amazing\add* strength¦120478.”
\v 16 \add ≈Day after day she nagged and pestered¦120490 him until he was sick to death¦120493 of hearing it\add*.
\v 17 \add ≈So¦120495\add* \add finally\add* he told her \add ≈his secret\add*, “\add ≈My hair has never been cut\add* because I've been a Nazirite¦120514 to God¦120515 \add ≈since my birth\add*.

\p
\v 18 When Delilah¦120532 perceived that he'd told her \add ≈his deepest secret\add*, she summoned the Philistine leaders, “Come \add ≈here\add* one more time¦120550, because he's told me \add ≈his secret\add*.” \add ≈So¦120531\add* the Philistine leaders came¦120561, bringing the silver \add coins\add* \add ≈with them\add*.
\v 19 Then¦120576 she made him fall asleep¦120569 on her knees, and she called¦120573 in a man¦120574 to shave¦120575 off his seven¦120578 locks \add ≈of hair\add*, causing him to start to weaken, and his \add additional\add* strength¦120584 left him.
\v 20 Then¦120587 she said, “The Philistines¦120588 are \add ≈here to get\add* you, Shimshon¦120590!” He woke up and \add ≈thought to himself\add*, “I'll escape like \add ≈all the other times\add* and I'll shake¦120597 myself loose.” But¦120587 he didn't know that Yahweh had left him.
\v 21 \add ≈So¦120606\add* the Philistines¦120607 seized¦120606 him, and they gouged¦120608 out his eyes¦120611. They brought¦120612 him to Gaza and chained him with a pair of bronze¦120616 shackles¦120616, then \add ≈they put him to work in prison¦120620\add* grinding¦120618 \add grain\add*.

\v 23 \add Some time later,\add* the Philistine leaders gathered¦120634 together for a celebration and to offer¦120636 a large sacrifice¦120637 to their¦120641 god Dagon¦120640, saying, “Our god has \add ≈helped us capture\add* our terrible enemy¦120649, Shimshon¦120648.”

\v 25 \add ≈Later in the celebration when the drink had liberated their thinking\add*, they said¦120680, “Call for Shimshon so he can \add ≈entertain¦120683 us\add*.” So¦120675 they \add ≈brought\add* Shimshon in from the \add ≈prison¦120689\add* and \add taunted him\add* \add ≈to get them all laughing\add*. They made him stand¦120693 among the pillars¦120696 \add of the building\add*
\v 26 and \add *he\add* \add ≈asked\add* the servant¦120702 who was \add ≈guiding him\add* by the hand¦120704, “Place my hands against¦120717 the two pillars¦120711 holding up the building \add ≈so\add* I can lean on them.”
\v 27 The building was full of the men and the women, \add ≈including\add* the Philistine leaders. On the roof there¦120723 were about¦120730 three¦120730 thousand¦120731 men and women watching¦120734 the entertainment with Shimshon¦120736.
\p
\v 28 Then¦120738 Shimshon¦120739 called¦120738 out to Yahweh, “My master¦120744 Yahweh, please remember¦120746 me. Strengthen me please, just this time¦120751, oh God¦120753, so that I can avenge myself by one \add last\add* act of vengeance¦120755 on the Philistines¦120760 \add to make them pay for\add* my two¦120758 eyes¦120759.”
\v 29 Then¦120762 \add *he\add* took hold of the two¦120766 centre pillars¦120768 on which¦120770 the building depended, and \add ≈pressed out\add* against¦120775 them—one in his right¦120777 hand¦120777 and one in his left.
\v 30 Then¦120781 \add *he\add* \add ≈exclaimed\add*, “\add ≈Let me\add* die with the Philistines¦120787!” He stretched out with his strength and the building fell on \add &their\add* leaders and all of the people in it. \add ≈So¦120781\add* he killed more people at his death¦120807 than he had killed during his life.

\p His mother said, “May Yahweh bless¦120873 you, my son.”
\v 3 Then¦120877 he brought back the \add ≈eleven\add* hundred¦120882 silver coins to his mother and \add *she\add* \add ≈declared\add*, “I will certainly consecrate the money to Yahweh \add ≈for my son's benefit\add*. \add ≈Take it and we'll use it to have one statue carved¦120896 and another cast\add*.”

\p
\v 5 Now¦120929 that Micah¦120921 had a \add ≈shrine with gods in it\add*, he made \add ≈some priestly robes\add* and \add ≈some household¦120923 gods\add*, and consecrated one of his sons¦120933 as his priest¦120937.

\v 1 In those days, Israel \add ≈didn't have a\add* king. The tribe of Dan was looking¦121079 for¦121079 land to settle in, because up \add ≈until¦121089 then\add*, \add ≈they hadn't been able to claim their allocated region\add* among the Israeli tribes.
\v 2 \add ≈So\add* the Danites sent out five capable men (from Zorah and from Eshtaol) to scout out the region and explore it.

\p
\v 4 Then¦121168 he told them what Micah¦121174 had done for him, and how he'd hired¦121175 him to be like his priest¦121179.

\v 5 \add ≈So¦121181\add* they¦121181 \add ≈asked\add* him, “Please find out from God¦121186 if we'll have success¦121188 on this expedition we're on.”
\p
\v 6 “\add ≈Continue on\add* in peace¦121199,” the priest¦121197 said¦121195. “Yahweh has \add ≈prepared everything ahead\add* of you all.”

No one in the region was causing \add ≈trouble\add* for them and \add ≈they were very settled\add*. They were far away from the Tsidonians and \add ≈didn't interact with others\add*.
\v 8 Then¦121247 they went¦121247 \add back\add* to their relatives in Tsorah and Eshtaol, who \add ≈asked\add* them, “How \add ≈did it go\add*?”
\v 9 “Get \add ≈ready immediately\add*,” they \add ≈said\add*, “so that we can go \add to battle\add* against¦121262 them!

\v 19 “Stay quiet¦121475,” they told him. “Put your hand¦121478 over your mouth¦121481 and come with us, and be like a father¦121487 and a priest for us. Is it better¦121489 to be a priest for \add only\add* \add ≈one household¦121493\add*, or to be a priest for a \add whole\add* related tribe¦121499 in Israel?”
\v 20 The priest \add ≈liked that idea\add*, so he went¦121516 along with them—taking the \add ≈priestly gear\add* and the \add ≈household idols\add*, and the carved¦121515 image¦121515.
\p
\v 21 Then¦121520 they \add went back to the main path\add* and continued on their way with the children, animals, and \add those carrying\add* the valuable property going in front¦121532.
\v 22 When they'd already gone \add ≈quite some\add* distance from Micah's house¦121540, Micah and \add ≈his neighbours\add* gathered together¦121546, then the men¦121538 ran \add in a group\add* and caught up with the \add ≈Danites\add*.
\v 23 They called¦121568 \add ≈out to the Danites\add* who turned¦121560 around \add ≈to face¦121561 them\add* and \add ≈asked\add* Micah¦121563, “What's \add ≈the matter? Why has this group come\add* together¦121568?”
\v 24 “You all took my gods¦121573 that I made,” Micah \add ≈replied\add*, “And the priest¦121580. Then¦121570 you \add ≈disappeared and I had nothing left\add*. \add ≈So¦121570\add* how can you all \add ≈ask\add* me what \add ≈the matter is\add*!”
\p
\v 25 “\add ≈I wouldn't say too much if I was you,” he was told. “Otherwise some of our more fiery men¦121609 might start to get a bit hostile, then you'd bring about your own death, and that of your companions\add*!”
\v 26 Then¦121617 Micah¦121623 realised that they were too strong¦121626 for \add #them\add*, so \add #they\add* turned¦121629 back around and went home¦121633.
\rem /s1 The Danites Settle in Layish
\p \add ≈So¦121617\add* the Danites¦121620 continued onward,
\v 27 taking with them the things that Micah¦121641 had made, as well as his priest¦121644. They came¦121649 to Layish¦121652 where the unsuspecting¦121657 people¦121655 were living peaceably¦121656, and they slaughtered them with their swords¦121662 and burnt down the city¦121665.
\v 28 \add ≈No one came to rescue them\add* because it was \add ≈a long way\add* from Tsidon and \add ≈they did have much involvement with them anyway\add*. (\add @Layish\add* was in the valley¦121684 near Beyt-Rehob.) They rebuilt¦121689 the city¦121692 and then \add ≈moved into\add* it.
\v 29 They named the \add rebuilt\add* city Dan (instead of Layish¦121708) in honour of their¦121703 ancestor¦121703 Dan who was one of Israel's sons.
\v 30 The Danites \add ≈mounted\add* the carved¦121721 image¦121721 for themselves \add to worship\add*. Yonatan (Gershom's son from Manashsheh) became the priest for the Danites (and then his descendants¦121716 until¦121736 when the people were \add eventually\add* exiled from the region).
\v 31 \add ≈So¦121742\add* they set up the carved¦121746 image¦121746 that Micah¦121747 had made \add and worshipped it\add* \add ≈the whole time that God's¦121744 tent\add* was at Shiloh¦121757.

\s1 The Levite and his slave-wife
\rem /s1 The Levite and His Concubine; A Levite and His Concubine; The Levite's Concubine
\p
\v 1 In those¦121762 days¦121761 when there was no king¦121763 over Israel, there was a Levite man who was staying in the remotest¦121771 parts of the hill country¦121772 of Efraim¦121774. He took a slave-wife for himself from Bethlehem in Yehudah.
\v 2 \add ≈However\add*, \add *she\add* started sleeping around, and then she left him and went to her father's¦121792 house in Bethlehem \add where she ended up\add* staying for four months¦121803.
\v 3 Then¦121805 her husband \add ≈got organised\add* and went¦121807 after¦121808 her—to \add ≈sweet-talk\add* her and persuade her to return with him. He took a young \add servant¦121815\add* man and a team of donkeys¦121818. She invited \add @her husband\add* into her father's house¦121820, and when \add *her\add* father saw¦121822 him, he was glad to meet him.
\v 4 His father-in-law (her father) insisted \add ≈on offering hospitality\add*, so they ate¦121838 and drank¦121839, and he stayed the night¦121840, and \add ended up\add* staying for three¦121836 days¦121837.
\v 5 Then¦121843 on the fourth¦121845 day¦121844, they got up early¦121846 and \add @the Levite\add* prepared to leave, but his father-in-law \add ≈urged him to eat before they left\add*.
\p
\v 6 \add ≈So¦121864\add* the two of them ate¦121865 and drank¦121868 together¦121867, and then the woman's father¦121870 said¦121869, “Please stay \add another\add* night¦121878. \add ≈Relax and have a good time\add*.”
\p
\v 7 The man¦121883 got ready to leave, however his father-in-law persisted, so he stayed \add another\add* night¦121890 there¦121891.
\v 8 He got up early¦121893 in the morning¦121894 on the fifth¦121896 day to get ready to leave, but the father¦121900 of the young woman said, “\add ≈Get some energy first\add*.” So¦121893 they waited until¦121907 later in the day, and then the two of them ate.
\p
\v 9 \add ≈When\add* the man stood up to go with his slave-wife and his young man, his father-in-law said, “Listen, the day's \add ≈coming to an end soon\add*. Please stay the night. See, \add ≈it'll be getting dark soon\add*. Spend the night here and \add ≈be happy\add*. Then¦121914 make an early¦121940 start tomorrow¦121941 for your journey¦121942 \add ≈home¦121944\add*.”
\p
\v 10 \add ≈But¦121946\add* the man¦121949 from the tribe of Levi didn't want to stay another night¦121950. He put saddles¦121963 on his two donkeys¦121962, and started to go with his slave-wife and his servant toward Yebus city (now called Yerushalem).
\p
\v 11 They got close to Yebus¦121987 and the daylight had \add ≈mostly gone, so\add* the young man said¦121974 to his master¦121978, “Come, please¦121981, we should turn¦121982 aside¦121982 into this city¦121985 of the Jebusites so we can spend¦121989 the night¦121989 there.”
\v 12 “We won't \add ≈go¦122007\add* into a into a city¦121999 of \add #foreigners\add*, his master¦121994 \add ≈replied\add*. “There's no \add ≈Israelis¦122005 there\add*. \add ≈Better to keep going until we¦121996\add* reach Gibeah.”
\v 13 Then¦122012 he \add ≈added\add*, “\add ≈Yes, let's keep going to reach¦122017\add* either Gibeah or Ramah to spend¦122020 the night¦122020 in.”
\v 14 So¦122025 they passed¦122025 \add Yebus\add* and went on, \add ≈but\add* the sun¦122029 went down as they neared Gibeah (in Benyamite \add territory\add*)
\v 15 \add ≈so\add* they went into Gibeah to spend the night there¦122036. They went and sat in the open plaza of the city¦122043, \add ≈but\add* no one \add ≈invited them into their home¦122049 for the night\add*.
\p
\v 16 \add ≈But¦122052\add* then in \add late\add* evening¦122063, an old man came in from his work in the field¦122062. \add *He\add* was from the Efraimite hill country \add ≈but\add* \add currently\add* staying in the Gibeah area \add ≈where\add* the \add ≈residents\add* were Benyamites.
\v 17 He \add ≈looked up\add* and \add ≈noticed them\add* in the open plaza of the city¦122084 and \add ≈asked\add* the man, “Where are you going¦122091, and where have you come from?”
\p
\v 18 “We're passing¦122097 through from Bethlehem in Yehudah¦122116,” \add @the Levite\add* \add ≈replied\add*. “Going to the remote¦122105 parts¦122105 of the Efraimite hill country¦122106 \add ≈where I'm from\add*.

\v 19 \add We have our own\add* food and straw¦122131 for our donkeys¦122136, and \add enough\add* food and wine for \add ≈the three of us\add* \add so\add* we don't¦122148 need anything else.
\p
\v 20 “Peace to you all,” said¦122154 the old man¦122155. “\add ≈Let me supply\add* everything you need—only don't¦122166 spend¦122168 the night¦122168 \add here\add* in the square¦122165.”
\v 21 Then¦122170 he took \add #them\add* to his house¦122171 and fed \add &their\add* donkeys¦122176. They¦122176 washed¦122177 their feet¦122178, and they \add all\add* ate¦122179 and drank¦122180.
\rem /s1 Gibeah's Crime
\v 22 They were \add ≈having a good time\add*, but suddenly the men of the city¦122189—wicked men—had \add ≈surrounded¦122194\add* the house—pounding repeatedly on the door¦122201.

\v 25 But¦122289 the men¦122279 weren't willing¦122278 to listen¦122280 to him, so the man¦122283 \add ≈pushed his slave-wife out\add* to them and they \add ≈raped\add* her and abused¦122290 her the whole night¦122295 until¦122296 the morning¦122298, \add ≈when\add* they \add ≈discarded\add* her \add ≈as it began to\add* dawn.

\v 1 Then all the Israelis¦122410 from Dan¦122415 \add in the north\add* to Beersheba \add in the south\add*, and \add even\add* from Gilead¦122421 \add across the Yordan\add*, came and assembled¦122411 before Yahweh at Mitspah with \add ≈one single, united purpose\add*.

\p
\v 4 \add ≈So¦122466\add* the Levite man (the husband¦122469 of the woman¦122470 who had been murdered¦122471) answered¦122466, “I went¦122476 to the Gibeah \add region\add* (in Benyamin) with my slave-wife to spend¦122479 the night¦122479.

\v 27 \add *They\add* asked Yahweh (because the box¦122893 containing the agreement with the true God¦122895 was there¦122892 in those¦122897 days¦122896

\v 41 Then¦123171 the \add main\add* \add ≈Israeli force\add* \add stopped retreating and¦123174\add* turned¦123173 back \add to attack again\add*. The \add ≈Benyamites\add* were horrified because \add #they\add* \add now\add* saw¦123178 that disaster¦123183 had struck them.
\v 42 They retreated¦123185 away from the \add ≈Israelis\add* into the wilderness¦123192, but the battle¦123193 overtook¦123194 \add #them\add*, plus \add @the Israelis\add* were coming \add back\add* out of the cities¦123196 \add ≈getting right in amongst them\add* \add to fight\add*.
\v 43 They surrounded¦123201 \add ≈the Benyamites as they tried to flee\add*, and easily ran \add #them\add* down as \add ≈they tried to escape from the Gibeah region towards¦123211 the east\add*.
\v 44 Eighteen thousand¦123220 strong \add ≈Benyamite warriors were killed\add*,
\v 45 and \add the rest\add* turned¦123231 and fled into the wilderness¦123233 towards¦123233 the Rimmon rock¦123236. \add ≈Another five¦123240 thousand men were killed\add* along the trails. They chased them \add ≈all the way\add* to Gidom, and killed \add another\add* two¦123250 thousand men,
\v 46 \add ≈so the total number of Benyamite swordsmen¦123263 who were killed came to\add* twenty-five thousand¦123260—all strong \add ≈warriors\add*.
\p
\v 47 \add ≈But¦123275\add* six hundred¦123283 men \add ≈made it\add* to Rimmon rock, and they stayed there for four months¦123289.
\v 48 \add ≈Meanwhile, the Israelis¦123292\add* went back to the Benyamite \add region\add* and killed the people with their swords¦123301—entire¦123312 cities including cattle and everything¦123308 else—then the cities were set on fire.

\v 1 \add ≈Now\add* \add back\add* in Mitspah, the Israeli men¦123320 had promised never to allow their daughters¦123330 \add ≈to marry\add* a Benyamite man.
\v 2 \add ≈But¦123334\add* \add now\add* the Israelis went¦123334 to Bethel and sat there¦123340 before God¦123345 until¦123341 evening¦123343—calling out and crying loudly,
\v 3 \add ≈asking\add*, “Oh Yahweh, God¦123355 of Israel, why has this happened¦123357 to Israel—for one tribe¦123363 \add ≈to be missing¦123360\add* from Israel \add ≈now\add*?”
\p
\v 4 The next day¦123367, the people¦123369 got up early¦123368 and built¦123370 an altar¦123373 there¦123372, and they offered up burnt¦123375 offerings and peace offerings.
\v 5 Then the \add ≈Israelis¦123381 asked\add*, “Among all the Israeli tribes¦123390 serving Yahweh, \add ≈was there any group who didn't join the battle\add*?” (\add They asked that\add* because they¦123379 had \add ≈previously decided that anyone who didn't go to Mitspah to fight for Yahweh would\add* be put to death¦123409.)
\v 6 \add ≈Now the Israelis¦123413 felt sorry for their Benyamite cousins\add*, saying, “An \add entire\add* tribe¦123421 has been \add ≈hacked off\add* Israel today.
\v 7 \add ≈How can we find wives for any\add* \add Benyamite\add* men that are left because we've promised to Yahweh not to give our daughters¦123438 to them \add ≈to marry\add*?
\p
\v 8 \add ≈So¦123441\add* they¦123441 \add ≈asked\add*, “Is there any \add ≈from our tribes¦123444\add* who didn't \add ≈show up for\add* Yahweh at Mitspah?” Then¦123441 listen, no one from Yabesh-Gilead had \add ≈joined their assembly¦123466\add* \add there\add*.
\v 9 (\add ≈When\add* the people¦123469 had \add ≈checked around\add* themselves, \add they'd realised that\add* no one from Yabesh-Gilead was there.)
\v 10 \add ≈So¦123479 the Israelis\add* sent¦123479 twelve thousand¦123486 \add ≈warriors\add* there¦123481, commanding¦123490 them to use their swords¦123502 to kill the inhabitants¦123497 of Yabesh-Gilead, including \add married\add* women¦123503 and \add ≈children\add*—
\v 11 \add specifically\add* they had to kill¦123520 every male, and every woman¦123515 who's \add ≈slept with\add* a male.
\v 12 \add That way\add* they discovered four¦123527 hundred¦123528 young¦123529 virgin¦123530 women among¦123523 the inhabitants¦123523 of Yabesh-Gilead, and brought¦123538 them \add back\add* to their camp at Shiloh¦123543 (in the Canaan¦123546 \add region\add*).
\p
\v 13 Then the entire¦123550 assembly sent¦123549 a message to the \add ≈Benyamites\add* at Rimmon rock¦123559, \add ≈saying that they¦123553 were now ready for peace¦123563\add*.
\v 14 So¦123565 the \add ≈Benyamites\add* returned¦123565 and were given the young women from Yabesh-Gilead, \add ≈but\add* there wasn't enough of them.
\p
\v 15 The people¦123583 \add still\add* felt sorry for the \add ≈Benyamites\add*, because Yahweh had \add ≈caused\add* a gap among Israel's tribes¦123591,
\v 16 \add ≈so the leaders asked\add*, “How can we¦123599 provide wives¦123601 for the remaining \add @Benyamite men\add* since \add the other\add* Benyamite women \add ≈were wiped out\add*?”
\v 17 \add Because\add* they¦123608 said¦123608, “\add ≈They must be able to procreate so that\add* an entire Israeli tribe¦123615 isn't blotted out.
\v 18 \add ≈But¦123618 we can't be the ones to give¦123621 our daughters¦123625 to them to marry because we made an oath that anyone who did that would\add* be cursed¦123633.”
\p
\v 19 They said¦123639, “Listen, there's a celebration for Yahweh from time to time at Shiloh¦123644, which¦123648 is on the north¦123649 of Bethel, east of the road that goes¦123656 from Bethel uphill to Shechem, and on the south¦123661 of Lebonah.”
\v 20 \add ≈So¦123664\add* they \add ≈told the Benyamites\add*, “Go and¦123673 hide in those vineyards¦123674
\v 21 and watch¦123676. \add ≈When\add* the Shiloh girls come out to \add ≈perform\add* in the dances¦123684, come out of the vineyards¦123689 and you can each catch a wife for yourselves, then go \add back home\add* to Benyamin.
\v 22 \add ≈When\add* their fathers¦123704 or brothers¦123706 complain¦123707 to us, we'll tell them, “\add ≈Let them have them since we didn't find you for them. And you all won't be guilty¦123727 of giving them to the Benyamites\add* \add because they stole them\add*.
\p
\v 23 \add ≈So that's what the Benyamites\add* did—they grabbed enough dancing girls to be their wives¦123736, then they returned¦123744 to their \add ≈allocated land\add* and rebuilt¦123748 their cities¦123751 and lived¦123752 in them.
\v 24 The \add other\add* \add ≈Israelis¦123759\add* went¦123765 back to their tribes¦123763 and their families¦123764 in the areas that \add ≈had been allocated to them\add*.
\p
\v 25 In those¦123771 days¦123770, there¦123772 was no king¦123773 in Israel—everyone would \add just\add* do \add ≈what seemed right¦123776 to them\add*.\x + \xo 21:25: \xt Jdg 17:6.\x*
