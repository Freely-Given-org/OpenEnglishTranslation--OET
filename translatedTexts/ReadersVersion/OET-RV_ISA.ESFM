\rem /s1 The Suffering and Glory of the Servant; The Suffering Servant; The Lord's Suffering Servant
\p
\v 13 Listen, my servant¦300164 will prosper¦300163—
\q1 ≈he'll be \add ≈promoted and highly honoured\add*.
\q1
\v 14 Many people were horrified at you¦300172—his appearance¦300178 was so disfigured
\q1 ≈and¦300179 his body \add ≡was so disfigured\add* \add ≈that he no longer looked like a man¦300177\add*.
\q1
\v 15 So he'll startle¦300184 many nations¦300185.
\q1 Kings will shut their¦300190 mouths¦300190 because even if they hadn't been told about it,
\q1 ≈they'll see¦300197 and understand¦300202 what they hadn't heard¦300201 about.\x + \xo 52:15: \xt Rom 15:21.\x*
\c 53
\p
\v 1 Who has believed¦300205 our¦300206 message¦300206,\x + \xo 53:1: \xt Rom 10:16; Yhn 12:38.\x*
\q1 ≈and¦300207 who has Yahweh's \add ≈power\add* been revealed¦300212 to?
\q1
\v 2 He grew in front of him like a young¦300215 plant¦300215,
\q1 ≈and like a root out of the dry ground¦300218.
\q1 He had no \add fancy\add* form or splendour¦300225 to look¦300226 at,
\q1 ≈and his appearance¦300229 \add ≈didn't¦300220 attrack us to him\add*.
\q1
\v 3 He was despised and rejected¦300233 by people—
\q1 ≈a man¦300235 \add ≈with a lot of\add* pain and familiar with sickness¦300238
\q1 like someone that \add ≈most people would look away from\add*
\q1 ≈and despise him, \add ≈rather than to\add* esteem¦300244 him.
\b
\q1
\v 4 \add ≈Despite that\add*, he's borne our sicknesses¦300247
\q1 ≈and carried¦300251 our sorrows¦300250.
\q1 We \add ≈thought\add* that he'd been struck¦300255 down by God¦300256—
\q1 ≈attacked and made to suffer.\x + \xo 53:4: \xt Mat 8:17.\x*
\q1
\v 5 \add ≈But¦300259\add* he was pierced¦300260 for our disobedience,
\q1 ≈and crushed¦300262 for our wicked actions.
\q1 The punishment that \add gave us\add* peace¦300265 was on him,
\q1 ≈and we were healed¦300268 \add thanks\add* to his wounds¦300267.\x + \xo 53:5: \xt 1Pe 2:24.\x*
\q1
\v 6 We've all strayed away like sheep¦300273—
\q1 ≈\add ≈everyone's gone in their own direction\add*
\q1 and¦300278 Yahweh¦300278 has placed all our¦300283 disobedience onto him.\x + \xo 53:6: \xt 1Pe 2:25.\x*
\b
\q1
\v 7 He was oppressed¦300285 and tormented
\q1 \add ≈but\add* like a lamb being led away to be slaughtered¦300293, he didn't open his mouth,
\q1 ≈and like a sheep¦300295 that's silent in front¦300296 of its shearers¦300297, he didn't open his mouth.\x + \xo 53:7: \xt Rev 5:6.\x*
\q1
\v 8 \add ≈After\add* oppression¦300303 and judgement¦300304, he was taken¦300305 away,
\q1 \add ≈but how many of his peers even cared\add* that he was cut off from the land of the living¦300314?
\q1 He was wounded¦300317 because of the disobedience of my people¦300316.
\q1
\v 9 His burial place was among the criminals,
\q1 and a rich man at his death¦300328,
\q1 although he'd committed no violent¦300332 acts,
\q1 and \add ≈had never spoken deceitfully¦300335\add*.\x + \xo 53:9: \xt 1Pe 2:22.\x*
\b
\q1
\v 10 \add ≈But¦300338\add* Yahweh¦300352 desired¦300339 to crush¦300340 him—
\q1 he made him sick¦300341 if it would make his life¦300346 a guilt-offering.
\q1 He will live long and see¦300347 offspring¦300348,
\q1 and Yahweh' plans will prosper¦300354 \add ≈through his work\add*.
\q1
\v 11 Due to his internal anguish¦300356, he'll be able to see¦300358.
\q1 He'll be satisfied¦300359 with his knowledge¦300360.
\q1 My \add ≈obedient\add* servant¦300363 will justify¦300361 many,
\q1 and he will carry¦300367 their¦300365 disobedience.
\q1
\v 12 \add ≈Because of that,\add* I'll allocate a portion¦300370 for him.
\q1 He'll divide out the plunder¦300378 to a powerful people
\q1 because¦300379 he poured¦300381 out his life¦300383 \add ≈resulting in\add* his death¦300382.
\q1 He was included with the wicked,
\q1 and he bore the disobedience of many people,
\q1 and he intervened on behalf of the disobedient.\x + \xo 53:12: \xt Luk 22:37.\x*
