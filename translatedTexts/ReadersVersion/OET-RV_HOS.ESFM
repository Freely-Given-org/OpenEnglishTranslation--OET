\v 2 When Yahweh first spoke¦363595 through Hoshea¦363598, \add *he\add* told \add *him\add*, “Go and \add ≈get yourself¦363608 a prostitute for a wife¦363609\add* and have children¦363611 \add ≈from her\add*, because the \add ≈country\add* is committing flagrant prostitution by forsaking Yahweh.”
\p
\v 3 So¦363621 he went¦363621 and \add ≈married\add* Divlayim's¦363628 daughter¦363626 Gomer¦363625, and she \add ≈got pregnant¦363629\add* and bore him a son.
\v 4 Then¦363635 Yahweh¦363636 told him, “Name him Yizre'el, because in a little¦363644 while I'll avenge the blood¦363648 \add shed\add* in the Yizre'el \add valley\add* on Yehu's¦363653 \add ≈family\add*, and I'll put an end¦363654 to the kingdom¦363655 of Yisrael.\x + \xo 1:4: \xt 2Ki 10:11.\x*
\v 5 \add ≈At that time\add* in the Yizre'el valley¦363667, I'll break¦363662 Yisrael's \add ≈military power\add*.
\p
\v 6 Then¦363670 \add @Gomer\add* conceived¦363670 again and bore a daughter¦363673, and \add @Yahweh\add* told \add @Hoshea\add*, “Name her Lo-Ruhamah¦363679 \add (which means ‘No mercy’)\add*, because I'll no longer have mercy on the \add ≈Israelis¦363687, and I won't¦363681\add* forgive them at all.
\v 7 But¦363695 I'll have mercy on the Yehudah's¦363698 \add ≈descendants\add*, and I'll save them \add so they'll be able to see that it was\add* their¦363702 God¦363702 Yahweh. (I won't¦363703 save them using \add #bows, swords¦363706, battles\add*, horses¦363708, or horsemen.)”
\p
\v 8 After she'd weaned¦363711 Lo-Ruhamah¦363715, she got pregnant¦363716 \add again\add* and bore a \add second\add* son.
\v 9 Then¦363720 Yahweh said, “Name him Lo-Ammi \add (which means ‘Not my people’)\add* because you're not my people and I'm not your God.”

\v 11 The people from \add both\add* Yehudah and Yisrael will be gathered together. They'll appoint one leader for themselves, and they'll \add ≈come out of the countries\add* \add where they'd been exiled\add*, because the day of Yizre'el \add (which means ‘planted by God’)\add* will be great.

\v 2 Contend with your mother, contend, because she's not my wife,

\q1 Let her \add ≈turn her face away from\add* prostitution,
\q1 and \add ≡cease\add* her adultery from between her breasts.
\q1
\v 3 If she doesn't, I'll strip her naked

\q1 I will make her like the wilderness,
\q1 ≈and make her like a sun-baked land,
\q1 →and I'll make her die from thirst.
\q1
\v 4 I¦363805 won't¦363803 have mercy on her¦363809 children,
\q1 →because they're \add ≈the products\add* of prostitution,

\v 5 because their mother has \add ≈dabbled in prostitution\add*—

\q1 \add ≈Yes,\add* she¦363823 had said, “I'll go after my lovers,

\q1
\v 6 Therefore, I'll \add ≈fence her paths in\add* with thorns.

\q1
\v 7 She'll \add try to\add* pursue her lovers¦363854, \add ≈but\add* she won't \add be able to\add* \add ≈catch up to\add* them.
\q1 ≈She'll search for them, \add ≈but\add* she won't \add be able to\add* find them.
\q1 Then she'll say, “I'll go¦363852 and return to my first husband,

\q1
\v 8 \add ≈No,\add* she¦363878 hadn't known that it was me who gave her the grain, the new wine and the oil,
\q1 ≈and who lavished gold and silver on her,
\q1 →which they then used for Baal.
\q1
\v 9 Therefore I'll take my grain back in its time,
\q1 ≈and my new wine in its season.
\q1 I'll take away my wool and my flax
\q1 →that were used to cover her¦363884 nakedness.
\q1
\v 10 Now I'll uncover her lewdness \add ≈as her lovers watch\add*,
\q1 \add ≈but\add* no one can rescue her \add ≈from my punishment\add*.
\q1
\v 11 I'll¦363925 also put an end to all her mirth,
\q1 her feasts, her new-moon celebrations, her rest days, and all her scheduled festivals.
\q1
\v 12 “I'll destroy her grapevines and her fig trees,
\q1 of which she said, ‘Those are my wages that my lovers¦363946 gave me.’
\q1 I'll make them \add ≈grow wild\add*,
\q1 →and then the animals in the countryside will devour them.
\q1
\v 13 I'll punish her for the feast days for the Baals,
\q1 when she burned incense to them.
\q1 When she adorned herself with her rings and jewelry,
\q1 and went after her lovers and forgot me.”

\v 14 Therefore, listen, I'm going to entice her.

\v 16 Yahweh declares you'll call me, ‘My husband,’ \add ≈at the time\add*
\q1 ^and no longer call me, ‘My master \add (Heb. Baal)\add*,’
\q1
\v 17 because I'll remove the names of the Baals from her¦364026 mouth,
