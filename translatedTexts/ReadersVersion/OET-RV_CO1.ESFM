\mt2 Paul's first letter to the believers in
\mt1 Corinth
\is1 Introduction
\ip This is Paul's first letter to the believers in Corinth that we have in our Bibles, but could easily have been his second letter to them. We deduce this from his reference to other letters, e.g., see https://www.GotQuestions.org/how-many-letters-Corinthians.html, but we don't have copies of them.
\ip In this letter from Paul to the believers in Corinth, he wrote about his time preaching in Ephesus. He wrote this in order to help with problems experienced by various groups of believers that he founded there in Corinth. Corinth was the mother city of province of Achaia and Achaia was a province of Rome. At that time, Corinth was a large city that Greeks, Romans, and Jews all lived in, and because it was at the edge of the ocean, many buyers and sellers travelled there to board ships. So the city became famous because of its wealth, and many religions thrived there. There was also a lot of sexual immorality there as well as other ancient traditions. Paul lived there for almost two years in order to preach, and many people believed (Acts 18).
\ip After around three years had passed while Paul was there in Ephesus preaching, he received a letter from the believers in Corinth (1 Cor. 7:1). Again he heard about the persecution of the believers and of other problems that faced the assembly of believers. In this letter, he advised them about those, and stressed to need to removal sexual offenders from their assembly. Then he answered questions concerning marriage, widows, spiritual gifts, and the dead coming back to life.
\ip In chapter 13, it tells how love is an amazing gift from God to his people, in fact that's the overall theme of this document.
\ip It's helpful to understand that this letter (and most Biblical documents) were dictated to scribes (who didn't have word processors) so in terms of sentence structure, the discourses are often not edited or placed in their time sequences more correctly as we would do with modern documents, but rather we notice a lot of long, rambling, run-on sentences (like this one) which we sometimes break into shorter sentences to help our readers, but try not to do it too often as it tends to remove the connections between the thoughts and can even lead to the bad habit of people quoting verses out of the context in which they were written.

\rem /s1 Greetings from Paul

\p
\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul, a missionary of \nd Messiah Yeshua\nd* by God's will, and from our brother, Sosthenes.
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 1:2: \xt Acts 18:1.\x*\add It's written\add* to God's assembly there in Corinth—to those believers in Messiah Yeshua who've been declared guiltless \add and\add* who've been called to live holy lives, along with all those who appeal to the power of our and their \nd master Yeshua Messiah\nd*, everywhere.
\p
\v 3 Grace and peace to you all from \nd God\nd* our father and from the \nd master Yeshua Messiah\nd*.
\s1 Paul thanks God for what he's done
\rem /s1 Paul Gives Thanks to God; Blessings in Christ; Thanksgiving
\p
\v 4 I always thank my \nd God\nd* for you because of his grace that he's given you in \nd Messiah Yeshua\nd*—
\v 5 \add thanking him\add* that through him, you've all been enriched in every way: in all speech and in all knowledge
\v 6 as \add our\add* testimony about the messiah\f + \fr 1:6 \ft Or alternatively: as the messiah's testimony…\f* was confirmed in you all
\v 7 so that you all aren't missing out on any \add spiritual\add* gift as you eagerly wait for our \nd master Yeshua Messiah\nd* to be revealed.
\v 8 He will sustain you to the end, so that you all will be blameless at the \add return\add* of our \nd master Yeshua Messiah\nd*.
\v 9 The \nd God\nd* who called you into fellowship with his son \nd Yeshua Messiah\nd*, our \nd master\nd*, is faithful.
\s1 Follow Yeshua, not your leaders
\rem /s1 True and false wisdom; Divisions in the Church
\p
\v 10 Now brothers and sisters, I appeal to you in the name of our \nd master Yeshua Messiah\nd*, that you all agree together \add so\add* that there'll be no divisions among you, but rather that you'll be united in your thinking and in your purpose,
\v 11 because, my brothers and sisters, it's been made clear to me by some from Chloe's household, that you are quarrelling among yourselves.
\v 12 What I am talking about is how many of you are claiming that you belong to Paul's group, \add for example,\add* or that you belong to Apollos' group, or that you belong to Cephas' group, or that you belong to Messiah's group.\x + \xo 1:12: \xt Acts 18:24.\x*
\v 13 Has the \nd messiah\nd* been divided? Was it Paul who was executed for you? Or were you immersed \add in water\add* in the Paul's name?
\p
\v 14 I thank God that I didn't immerse any of you other than Crispus and Gaius,\x + \xo 1:14: a \xt Acts 18:8; \xo b \xt Acts 19:29; Rom 16:23.\x*
\v 15 so that no one can say that I had immersed you into my \add own\add* name.
\v 16 (\add Oh yes,\add* I also immersed Stephanas and his household, but I don't think I immersed anyone else.)\x + \xo 1:16: \xt 1Cor 16:15.\x*
\v 17 Because \nd Messiah\nd* didn't send me to immerse people \add in water\add*, but to preach the good message—\add but\add* not with words of wisdom just in case the messiah's \add execution on the\add* post gets deprived of importance.
\s1 The messiah is God's power and wisdom
\rem /s1 Christ the Power and Wisdom of God; The Wisdom of God
\p
\v 18 Because the account about the execution on a post seems just stupid to non-believers, but on the contrary to us being saved, it's God's power,
\v 19 because it was written:\x + \xo 1:19: \xt Isa 29:14 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘I will destroy the wisdom of the wise,
\q1 and I will nullify the understanding of the intelligent.’
\m
\v 20 Where is the wise \add person\add*? Where is the scholar? Where is the debater of this age? Hasn't \nd God\nd* turned the wisdom of the world into foolishness?\x + \xo 1:20: a \xt Yob 12:17; Isa 19:12; 33:18; \xo b \xt Isa 44:25.\x*
\p
\v 21 Because since the world, in God's wisdom, didn't know \add about\add* God through \add their\add* wisdom, God was pleased to save those who believe through the ‘foolish’ message that was preached.
\v 22 Jews ask for miraculous signs and Greeks search for wisdom,
\v 23 but we preach \add about how \add* \nd Messiah\nd* was executed—something the Jews can't logic out, and which the Greeks see as \add total\add* foolishness.
\v 24 Yet to those who \add God\add* calls, whether Jews or Greeks, \nd Messiah\nd* is \add both\add* God's power and his wisdom,
\v 25 because God's foolishness is better than humankind's wisdom, and God's weakness is greater than humankind's strength.
\p
\v 26 So brothers and sisters, think about how \add God\add* called you. Not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, and not many were of noble birth,
\v 27 but \nd God\nd* chose the foolish things of the world to shame those \add considered to be\add* wise, and he chose the weak things of the world to shame those \add considered to be\add* strong.
\v 28 He chose the lowly and despised things of the world, and the things that are not, to nullify the things that are,
\v 29 so that no human can boast to \nd God\nd*.
\v 30 But because of him, you are in \nd Messiah Yeshua\nd*, who was made to become wisdom from \nd God\nd* for us, and to become righteousness, and also sanctification and redemption,
\v 31 so that, as per the scriptures: ‘Let anyone who boasts, boast about \nd Yahweh\nd*.’\x + \xo 1:31: \xt Jer 9:24.\x*

\s1 Paul's preaching based on God's power
\rem /s1 Proclaiming Christ Crucified; The Message about the Crucified Christ; Paul Preaches Wisdom
\p
\v 1 Brothers and sisters, when I visited you all, I didn't try to impress you with flowery words or great wisdom when I taught you about God's \add incredible plan\add*,
\v 2 because I had decided \add in advance\add* to display knowledge about nothing else other than \nd Yeshua Messiah\nd* and his execution.
\v 3 And so I \add came\add* to you all in weakness and fear and with a lot of trembling,\x + \xo 2:3: \xt Acts 18:9.\x*
\v 4 and my message and my preaching wasn't delivered with persuasive words of wisdom, but \add rather\add* demonstrating \add God's\add* \nd spirit\nd* and power,
\v 5 so that your faith wouldn't be based on human wisdom, but on God's power.
\s1 Spiritual vs human wisdom
\rem /s1 The True Wisdom of God; Wisdom From the Spirit; God's Wisdom
\p
\v 6 However, \add when we're with\add* mature \add believers\add*, we speak wisdom—not the wisdom of this age, and not the wisdom of the rulers of this age who will come to nothing.
\v 7 Instead we speak about God's mysterious and hidden wisdom, which he had planned before \add creation to enable us to enter his kingdom\add*.
\v 8 None of the rulers of this \add present\add* age understood it, because if they had, they wouldn't have crucified the \nd master\nd* of \add that kingdom\add*,
\v 9 but as scripture says:\x + \xo 2:9: \xt Isa 64:4.\x*
\q1 ‘No eye has seen and no ear has heard,
\q1 and it's never entered any person's mind,
\q1 \add all\add* the things that \nd God\nd* has prepared for those who love him.’
\m
\v 10 But God has revealed it to us through his spirit, because \add his\add* spirit \add strives to know the meaning of everything\add*, even the deep things of God.
\v 11 \add Yes,\add* what person knows what \add other\add* people are thinking. Only the spirit of the person themself knows that. So too, no one knows God's thoughts other than God's \add own\add* spirit.
\v 12 \add No,\add* we haven't received the world's spirit, but \add rather\add* God's spirit so that we can recognise everything that God has freely given to us.
\p
\v 13 We don't speak about these things from our human wisdom, but rather, saying what \add God's\add* \nd spirit\nd* teaches—teaching spiritual things from spiritual \add sources\add*.
\v 14 Secular people don't accept things about God's \nd spirit\nd* because they seem foolish to them, and they can't understand them because it requires spiritual awareness,
\v 15 but spiritual people \add can\add* discern all \add these\add* things, even though others \add can't correctly\add* discern about them.
\v 16 \add This was stated in scripture:\add*\x + \xo 2:16: \xt Isa 40:13 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Who can understand Yahweh's mind?
\q1 Who's able to instruct him?’
\m But we \em do\em* \add know\add* the \nd messiah's\nd* mind!

\s1 Build solidly with godly wisdom
\rem /s1 On Divisions in the Church; On Divisions in the Corinthian Church; Paul and Apollos, Servants of Christ; Servants of God
\p
\v 1 So brothers and sisters, because you were baby Christians \add when I visited\add*, I wasn't able to speak to you all like spiritual \add people\add*, but \add only\add* like worldly \add people\add*.
\v 2 I gave you all milk to drink, because you weren't ready for solid food, in fact, you still aren't\x + \xo 3:2: \xt Heb 5:12-13.\x*
\v 3 because you're still worldly, because \add seeing\add* the jealousy and dissension among you \add tells us\add* that you're all still worldly and just living by human \add values\add*.
\v 4 Yes, when one person says, ‘I follow Paul,’ and another person says, ‘I follow Apollos’, doesn't that show that you're \add just\add* worldly?\x + \xo 3:4: \xt 1Cor 1:12.\x*
\p
\v 5 Indeed, who's Apollos? Who's Paul? We're just servants \add who brought you all the message\add* when you believed, each one as the \nd master\nd* led them.\f + \fr 3:5 \ft (NEEDS MORE RESEARCH BUT) It seems unclear here who the final part of the verse is referring to: a/ those who brought the message, or b/ those who received it. (We've chosen b/ in the OET-RV rendering.)\f*
\v 6 I planted \add the seed\add* and Apollos watered it, but \nd God\nd* made it grow.\x + \xo 3:6: a \xt Acts 18:4-11; \xo b \xt Acts 18:24-28.\x*
\v 7 That means that neither the planter or the waterer counts for anything, only the grower, \nd God\nd*.
\v 8 The planter and the waterer work together, and each of them will be rewarded for their work,
\v 9 because we are God's co-workers.
\p You all are God's field, or \add in a different image,\add* his building.
\v 10 Using the \add gifts\add* that \nd God\nd* has given me as a wise master-builder, I laid down a foundation and then someone else is building on it. But they need to take care about how they build on it
\v 11 because no one can lay a different foundation than the one already laid down, and that foundation is \nd Yeshua Messiah\nd*.
\v 12 Now if anyone builds on \add top of\add* the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw,
\v 13 then their work will become obvious because it will be revealed on the day \add of judgement\add* because it will be shown up by fire. The fire will expose what sort of \add building\add* their work \add created\add*:
\v 14 if anyone's work that they built survives the fire, \add those people\add* will be rewarded,
\v 15 \add but\add* if their work is incinerated, \add those people\add* will lose out, although they themselves will be saved but as if they've been through the flames.
\p
\v 16 Don't you realise that you \add yourselves\add* are God's temple, and that God's \nd spirit\nd* lives \add inside\add* you all?\x + \xo 3:16: \xt 1Cor 6:19; 2Cor 6:16.\x*
\v 17 If anyone destroys God's temple, then God will destroy that \add person\add* because his temple is sacred, as are all of you.
\p
\v 18 Don't let any of you fool yourselves. If anyone of you thinks they're wise by \add worldly standards\add*, then let \add those people\add* become ‘foolish’ so that they really can become wise
\v 19 because this world's wisdom is foolishness with \nd God\nd*, because as it's written: ‘He catches out the wise in their craftiness.’\x + \xo 3:19: \xt Yob 5:13.\x*
\v 20 And further: ‘\nd Yahweh\nd* knows that the thoughts of wise people are useless.’\x + \xo 3:20: \xt Psa 94:11.\x*
\v 21 So then, don't let anyone boast about people, because everything \add already\add* belongs to all of you.
\v 22 \add Don't boast about\add* Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or the present or the future. All of them belong to you,
\v 23 and you belong to Messiah, and Messiah belongs to \nd God\nd*.

\rem /s1 Paul and the Corinthians; The Ministry of the Apostles; Apostles of Christ
\p
\v 1 So then, people should regard us as servants of \nd Messiah\nd* and as stewards of God's mysteries.
\v 2 What's more, stewards are expected to be trustworthy.
\v 3 But it makes virtually no difference to me whether I'm being judged by you all, or by a human court, because I don't even judge myself.
\v 4 \add Yes,\add* my conscience is clear, but that won't mean that I'm declared ‘not guilty’, because it's \nd Yahweh\nd* who'll be examining me.
\v 5 So don't make judgements ahead of time, but wait until the \nd master\nd* comes—the one who'll bring to light what's hidden in the darkness, and who will expose people's \add true\add* motives. At that time, \nd God\nd* will praise each person \add who's acted faithfully\add*.
\p
\v 6 Now brothers and sisters, I applied these things to myself and Apollos for your sakes, so that through us you all might learn this: ‘Not beyond what is written,’ so that no one would be puffed up in favour of one against the other,
\v 7 because who makes you better than others? What do you have that wasn't given to you? And if it was given to you, why would you boast as if it hadn't been given to you?
\p
\v 8 Are you all full already? Have you all already become rich? You think you're kings already, and don't need us—I wish you all were really reigning as kings, so we could reign with you,
\v 9 because it seems that God has exhibited us missionaries last \add of all\add*, as if sentenced to death—because we have become a spectacle to the world—both to \add God's\add* messengers and to men.
\v 10 We \add appear as\add* fools for Messiah's sake, but you all are wise in Messiah. We are weak, but you all are strong. You all are honoured, but we are dishonoured.
\v 11 Right up to the present time, we're hungry and thirsty, we're poorly clothed and brutally beaten, and we're homeless
\v 12 and working hard—working with our own hands. When people curse us, we bless \add them\add*, and when they persecute us, we put up with it.\x + \xo 4:12: \xt Acts 18:3.\x*
\v 13 When people slander us, we answer gently. We've become like the scum of the world, the world's trash, even until now.
\rem /s1 Fatherly Admonition
\p
\v 14 I'm not writing this to shame you all, but to correct you as if you were my \add own\add* dear children,
\v 15 because if you all would have thousands of guardians in Messiah, yet you wouldn't have many ‘fathers’, because I fathered you in Messiah \nd Yeshua\nd* by means of the good message.
\v 16 That's why I urge you all to imitate me,\x + \xo 4:16: \xt 1Cor 11:1; Php 3:17.\x*
\v 17 and that's why I sent Timothy to \add visit\add* you. He's like my own dear son in \nd Yahweh\nd*, and he'll remind you all about my ways in \nd Messiah Yeshua\nd*, just like I teach everywhere in every church.
\p
\v 18 \add Now\add* some of you have become arrogant, as if I'm not able to come back to see you all,
\v 19 but if the \nd master\nd* allows it, I'll come and visit you all again soon. Then I won't just see what any puffed-up people are \em saying\em*, but I'll also see what \em power\em* they have,
\v 20 because God's kingdom isn't just mere words, but it's \add a demonstration of\add* power.
\v 21 What would you all prefer: should I come to you all with a rod, or \add come\add* with love and a gentle spirit?

\p
\v 1 Now concerning what you all wrote \add to me\add*: “It's good for a man not to touch a woman.”
\v 2 However, because there is so much sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.
\v 3 Both husbands and wives have a marital duty to each other \add in terms of sexual needs\add*:
\v 4 wives' bodies belong to their husbands, not to themselves, and similarly, husbands' bodies belong to their wives, not to themselves.

\p
\v 6 But that isn't a command—I'm only suggesting that it's good to do,\f + \fr 7:6 \ft It's not clear here whether Paul is referring back to marriage here (v2), or to abstaining from sex to focus on praying (v5).\f*

\v 8 Now to the unmarried and to the widows I say that it's good if they remain like me,\f + \fr 7:8 \ft This is intentionally left ambiguous because we can't be certain what Paul meant here.\f*
\v 9 but if they don't have self-control, they should marry because it's better to marry than to burn \add with sexual desire\add*.
\p
\v 10 Now I (\add well,\add* not I, but the \nd master\nd*) command married people that a wife is not to be separated from her husband\x + \xo 7:10-11: \xt Mat 5:32; 19:9; Mrk 10:11-12; Luk 16:18.\x*
\v 11 (but even if she might be separated, let her remain unmarried, or let her be reconciled to the husband), and a husband is not to divorce a wife.
\p
\v 12 But to the rest I say (I, not the \nd master\nd*) that if any believing husband has an unbelieving wife and she agrees to live with him, he shouldn't divorce her.
\v 13 Similarly, if any woman has an unbelieving husband and he agrees to live with her, she shouldn't divorce him.
\v 14 You see, the unbelieving husband is \add exposed to faith\add* through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is \add exposed to faith\add* through the believing husband, otherwise your children would be ‘defiled’, but now they are declared innocent.
\v 15 But if the unbeliever departs, let \add that person\add* go. In such cases, the believing spouse is not tied down \add to serving their departed spouse\add*, but \add rather\add* \nd God\nd* has called us to peace.
\v 16 You see, how do you know, woman, whether you will \add cause\add* your husband to be saved? Or how do you know, man, whether you will \add cause\add* your wife to be saved?
\s1 Sticking to your social position
\rem /s1 The Life That the Lord Has Assigned; Live As God Called You
\p
\v 17 Nevertheless, each person should live according to how the \nd master\nd* has assigned them and how \nd God\nd* has called them. That's what I teach in all the assemblies.
\v 18 Anyone who was called and who was \add previously\add* circumcised, shouldn't become ‘uncircumcised’. Anyone who was called who was uncircumcised, shouldn't get circumcised.
\v 19 Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but obeying God's commands \add is what counts\add*.
\v 20 Each person should maintain the position they were in when they were called:
\v 21 Were you a slave when you were called? Don't be concerned about that (but indeed, if you're able to become free, then take the opportunity)
\v 22 because anyone who was a slave when they were called by \nd Yahweh\nd* is free in \nd Yahweh's\nd* \add sight\add*. Conversely, anyone who was free when they were called is the \nd messiah's\nd* slave.
\v 23 You all were bought \add by God\add* for a price, \add so\add* don't become slaves of people.
\v 24 \add Again\add*\x + \xo 7:24 \xt 7:20\x* brothers and sisters, each person should remain in the position they were in when they were called, \add but now serving\add* \nd God\nd*.
\s1 Suggestions about the unmarried and about widows
\rem /s1 Questions about the Unmarried and the Widows
\rem /s1 The Unmarried and the Widows
\p
\v 25 Now concerning unmarried women, I don't have instructions from \nd Yahweh\nd* but I'll give my opinions as someone who's trustworthy thanks to \nd Yahweh's\nd* mercy.
\p
\v 26 Therefore, I think it's good because of the distress that's about to come, that people should stay as they are \add currently\add*.
\v 27 If you're married, then don't try to get out of it. If you're not committed, don't look for a spouse.
\v 28 But if a single guy or single girl get married, that's not a sin, but they'll \add likely\add* face difficult circumstances and I'm trying to spare you from that.
\p
\v 29 But brothers and sisters, I will say this: the time is short, so from now on, even those who are married should live as if they're not.
\v 30 Those who are mourning should \add act\add* as if they're not, those who are celebrating should \add act\add* as if they're not, and those who are buying \add act\add* as if they don't own \add anything\add*,
\v 31 and those who are using this world, as if they're not using it, because the present form of this world will soon pass away.
\p
\v 32 But I'd like you to be free from concern. Single men are concerned about things of the \nd master\nd*—pleasing the \nd master\nd*—
\v 33 but married men are concerned about worldly affairs—wanting to please their wives—so they're divided. And unmarried or single women
\v 34 are concerning about things of the \nd master\nd*—so that both their bodies and their spirits can be separate \add from the world\add*—but married women are concerned about worldly affairs—wanting to please their husbands.
\p
\v 35 Now I said \add all\add* that for your benefit—not to load you all with rules, but to \add act\add* in ways that are appropriate and devoted to the \nd master\nd* without any distractions.
\p
\v 36 However, if a man thinks he's made the wrong decisions about his unmarried woman,\f + \fr 7:36-38 \ft Yes, ‘his unmarried woman’ sounds strange, but it's not certain here (and in the next two verses) if Paul is writing about a father and \em his unmarried daughter who's engaged\em*, or about an engaged man deciding about \em his fiancée\em*.\f* if she's reached the age of marriage and it should proceed, then he should do what he planned—he's not sinning—they should get married.
\v 37 But if the man has made up his mind and isn't forced, but makes his own decision, and he's firmly decided to keep his own woman unmarried, then that would also be a good decision.
\v 38 That way, anyone allowing his unmarried woman to marry does well, but anyone who doesn't, makes a better decision.
\p
\v 39 A wife is committed to her husband as long as he lives, but if he passes away, she's free to marry whoever she wants to, as long as he's a believer.
\v 40 However, in my opinion, she'd be happier if she didn't marry again, and I think it's God's \nd spirit\nd* \add that wants me to say that\add*.

\s1 Behaviour about food offered to idols
\rem /s1 Food Sacrificed to Idols; The Question about Food Offered to Idols
\p
\v 1 Now, concerning \add food\add* that's been sacrificed to idols: We know that we all have ‘knowledge’—knowledge breeds conceit but love gives inner strength.
\v 2 Anyone who thinks they know something \add usually\add* doesn't know \add what they don't\add* know,
\v 3 but anyone who loves God is known by God.
\p
\v 4 Now \add back to\add* eating \add food\add* that's been offered to idols, we know that there's only one \nd God\nd* and so worldly idols are \add really\add* nothing \add at all\add*.
\v 5 Even though there are many so-called ‘gods’ and ‘masters’ \add said to\add* live in the heavens or earth,
\v 6 we know there's \add only\add* one \nd God\nd*, who is the Father who created everything and we exist \add to honour him\add*. And we only have one \nd master\nd*, \nd Yeshua Messiah\nd* who created everything and \add is also the source of our existence\add*.
\p
\v 7 But not everyone knows this. Some people have been so used to \add trusting\add* idols that \add even now as believers\add* when they eat food that's been sacrificed to idols, \add they still think it's wrong\add* and so their weak consciences become defiled.
\v 8 But food doesn't bring us closer to \nd God\nd*—what we eat makes us no better or worse off \add spiritually\add*.
\p
\v 9 However, be careful in case your freedom becomes a reason that weaker \add believers might get confused\add* and stumble in their \add spiritual walk\add*.
\v 10 \add Yes,\add* if someone with a weaker conscience sees you eating at a place with an idol, they might be encouraged to eat food that's offered to idols \add against their conscience\add*,
\v 11 thus this weaker believer who the \nd messiah\nd* also died for, \add might end up\add* being destroyed.
\v 12 If you end up sinning against other believers and wounding their weak consciences, you sin against \nd Messiah\nd*.
\v 13 Therefore, if food might cause a fellow believer to stumble, I'll certainly never eat meat, so that I won't cause them to stumble.

\v 1 Aren't I free? Aren't I a missionary? Haven't I seen \nd Yeshua\nd* our master? Aren't you all \add the result of\add* my work for \nd Yahweh\nd*?
\v 2 If I'm not a missionary to others, at least I am to all of you, because you're the proof that I'm a missionary for \nd Yahweh\nd*.
\v 3 That's my defence to those who are questioning my role.
\p
\v 4 Don't we have a right to eat and drink?
\v 5 Don't we have a right to take along a believing wife like the rest of the missionaries and the \nd master's\nd* brothers and Peter?
\v 6 Or it is only Barnabas and I who have to work \add to support ourselves\add*?
\v 7 What soldier has to pay his own expenses? Who plants a vineyard and isn't \add allowed\add* to eat its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and isn't \add allowed\add* to drink the milk \add they produce\add*?
\p
\v 8 Am I \add just\add* saying this from a human perspective? Doesn't \add Mosheh's\add* law also teach that?

\v 10 Isn't he saying that on \em our\em* behalf? \add Yes,\add* it was written for our sake \add saying\add* that anyone who's ploughing \add a field \add* should expect \add to be paid\add*, and anyone who threshes \add the grain\add* should expect a share of the harvest.
\v 11 If we sowed spiritual things among you, is it too much to expect a material ‘harvest’ from you?\x + \xo 9:11: \xt Rom 15:27.\x*
\v 12 If other people have the right to this \add kind of\add* support, don't we have a greater right?
\p But we never took advantage of that right—instead we endured everything so that we wouldn't do anything to hinder the \nd messiah's\nd* good message \add from spreading\add*.
\v 13 Don't you know that the temple workers eat from the temple \add budget\add*, and those who work at the altar receive a portion of what's offered?\x + \xo 9:13: \xt Deu 18:1.\x*
\v 14 Similarly, the \nd master\nd* even instructed that anyone who preaches the good message should be able to make their living off it.\x + \xo 9:14: \xt Mat 10:10; Luk 10:7.\x*
\p
\v 15 But I haven't taken advantage of \add any\add* of those rights, and even now, I'm not writing this to ask for material support for myself—I'd rather die than have someone deprive me of this reason for boasting.
\v 16 And yet, when I preach the good message, it doesn't give me any \add good\add* reason to boast because I'm \add actually\add* \em obligated\em* to do it—I wouldn't end well if I didn't preach the good message
\v 17 because if I do it willingly, I'll have a reward, but if it's done unwillingly, I'd be \add shirking\add* the responsibility entrusted to me.
\v 18 So, what's my reward? It's preaching the good message and \add the privilege of\add* doing it free of charge, so as not to take advantage of the right that the good message \add gives me\add*.
\p
\v 19 Although I have no obligation to any person, I made myself a slave of everyone in order to win over as many as possible.
\v 20 To the Jews, I behave like the Jew \add that I am\add* in order to win them. To those under the \add traditional\add* rules, I behave like one of them (although I myself am not under those rules) in order to win them over.
\v 21 To those outside \add our religious\add* rules, I behave like them (although not so far as to disobey God's law, because I'm under Messiah's law) in order to win them over.
\v 22 To the weak, I become weak to win them over. \add Yes,\add* I've become all things to all people so\f + \fr 9:27 \ft TODO: Investigate why so many other translations translate πάντως something like ‘by all means’ here (whereas our OET-LV gloss is ‘certainly’).\f* that I might be certain of saving some.

\v 24 Surely you all know that all the participants in a race run, but only one \add of them\add* gets the prize? Run in such a way that you get \add the prize\add*.
\v 25 But everyone who competes has to exercise self-control in every aspect. They do it in order to win a wreath that'll \add quickly\add* wilt, but we work towards one that never deteriorates.
\v 26 That's why I don't run aimlessly and don't box like someone punching the air,

\s1 Learn from history
\rem /s1 Warnings against Idols; Warnings From Israel's History; Warnings against Idolatry
\p
\v 1 Now brothers and sisters, I don't want you all to be ignorant about how our Jewish ancestors sheltered under the cloud and then they all passed through the sea,\x + \xo 10:1: a \xt Exo 13:21-22; \xo b \xt Exo 14:22-29.\x*
\v 2 so they were all immersed ‘into Mosheh’ in \add both\add* the cloud and the sea.
\v 3 They all ate the same supernatural food\x + \xo 10:3: \xt Exo 16:35.\x*
\v 4 and they all drank the same supernatural drink, because they drank from a supernatural rock that followed them, and that rock was the \nd messiah\nd*.\x + \xo 10:4: \xt Exo 17:6; Num 20:11.\x*
\v 5 Despite that, \nd God\nd* wasn't very happy with most of them, and they \add ended up\add* dying in the wilderness.\x + \xo 10:5: \xt Num 14:29-30.\x*
\p
\v 6 Those things \add back then\add* became examples for us, so that we wouldn't be desiring evil things like they did.\x + \xo 10:6: \xt Num 11:4.\x*
\v 7 Don't worship idols like some of them did, as it's written:\x + \xo 10:7: \xt Exo 32:6.\x* ‘The people sat down to eat and drink and \add then\add* stood up to \add dance to the golden calf\add*.’
\v 8 Nor should we commit sexual immorality like many of them did, and 23,000 people died in one day.\x + \xo 10:8: \xt Num 25:1-18.\x*
\v 9 And nor should we challenge the \nd master\nd* like some of \add our Jewish ancestors\add* did, and then they were killed by the snakes.\x + \xo 10:9: \xt Num 21:5-6.\x*
\v 10 Don't grumble like many of them did, and then they were killed by the \add death angel\add*.\x + \xo 10:10: \xt Num 16:41-49.\x*
\p
\v 11 All of those things happened to them as examples and were written down as warnings for us who are \add living\add* at the ends of the ages.
\p
\v 12 So if you think your \add faith is solid\add*, be careful that you don't fall.
\v 13 You all haven't been tempted by anything except what is common to humanity, but God is faithful and won't allow you to be tempted beyond what you all can handle. \add In fact,\add* along with the temptations, God will provide the way out so that you'll be able to endure them.
\rem /s1 Idol Feasts and the Lord's Supper

\v 14 So my dear friends, totally avoid idolatry.
\v 15 I'm speaking to sensible \add people\add*, \add so\add* judge what I'm telling you for yourselves.
\v 16 When we bless the ‘cup of blessing’, aren't we sharing the messiah's blood? When we break the bread, aren't we sharing the messiah's body?\x + \xo 10:16: \xt Mat 26:26-28; Mrk 14:22-24; Luk 22:19-20.\x*
\v 17 Because there's \add just\add* one loaf that we all eat pieces of, thus we who are many, are one body \add together\add*.

\v 18 Consider \add the people of\add* Yisrael \add (Israel)\add* from a physical perspective: Aren't those who eat \add portions\add* of the sacrifices, joining to the altar? RECHECK \x + \xo 10:18: \xt Lev 7:6.\x*
\v 19 So what am I saying? That whether or not food is sacrificed to idols means anything? Or that an idol is anything?
\v 20 \add No,\add* but the sacrifices of the pagans are offered to demons, not to \nd God\nd*, and I don't want you all to be partners with demons.\x + \xo 10:20: \xt Deu 32:17 (LXX).\x*

\v 24 No one should aim to satisfy themselves, but \add work for\add* the good of others.
\p
\v 25 You can eat anything that's sold at the \add meat\add* market without even raising questions of conscience,
\v 26 because:\x + \xo 10:26: \xt Psa 24:1.\x* ‘the earth and everything in it belongs to \nd Yahweh\nd*.’
\p
\v 27 If an unbeliever invites you \add to a meal\add* and you plan to go, eat anything that's set before you without raising questions of conscience,
\v 28 but if someone tells you, “That has been offered as a sacrifice,” for the sake of the person who told you and for the sake of conscience, don't eat it.
\v 29 Now when I said ‘for the sake of conscience’, I didn't mean \em your\em* conscience, but that of the other person, because why does \em my\em* freedom need to be judged by someone else's conscience?
\v 30 As long as I've thanked God for what I eat, why should I then criticise it?

\v 2 Now I commend you all because you always think of what I teach and do, and because you carefully believe and do what I taught you all,
\v 3 but I want you all to know that the messiah is the head of every man, and the man is the head of \add his wife\add*, and \nd God\nd* is the head of the messiah.\f + \fr 11:3 \ft The translators expect that this talk of ‘the head’ is referring to authority, but because our modern society has become more sensitive to these issues, we decided to keep it literal here, thus letting our readers decide for themselves what Paul probably meant. (Having done that, our readers can also consider for themselves whether this might have been a cultural necessity in and around Corinth, or whether it has widespread application to all cultures.)\f*
\v 4 Any man who prays or speaks out a prophecy with his head covered is dishonouring his head,
\v 5 but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head \em uncovered\em* dishonours her head, because it's just as if her head had been shaved.
\v 6 \add In fact\add* if a woman doesn't cover her head, then she should cut her hair off, but if it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or shaved off, then she should cover her head.
\v 7 On one side, a man shouldn't cover his head because men present God's image and his honour, but on the other side, women present \add their husbands'\add* honour,\x + \xo 11:7: \xt Gen 1:26-27.\x*
\v 8 because man wasn't made from the woman, but \add the first\add* woman was made out of man.\x + \xo 11:8-9: \xt Gen 2:18-23.\x*
\v 9 \add Indeed,\add* men weren't created for women, but women for men.
\v 10 Because of that, women should have authority on their heads, because of the messengers.\f + \fr 11:10 \ft Again, a rather literal translation because honestly, no one is really certain about what Paul was meaning here. See also https://GitHub.com/openenglishbible/Open-English-Bible/issues/356 and https://UASVBible.org/2024/02/03/unveiling-the-meaning-of-authority-in-1-corinthians-1110-a-textual-and-exegetical-clarification.\f*
\v 11 Nevertheless, in Messiah, women are not independent from men, nor are men independent from women,
\v 12 because just as the \add first\add* woman came out of the man, so too men \add are born\add* from women, but everything comes from \nd God\nd*.
\p
\v 13 \add So\add* judge for yourselves: is it proper for women to pray to \nd God\nd* \add with their heads\add* uncovered?
\v 14 Doesn't nature itself teach you all that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace for him,
\v 15 but if a woman has long hair, it's \add part of\add* her beauty because long hair has been given to women as a covering?
\v 16 However, if anyone's inclined to be contentious about this, that's not how either we \add ourselves\add* or God's assemblies behave.

\v 17 But I'm not complimenting you all in giving the following instructions, because your gatherings have been doing more harm than good.
\v 18 Firstly, I hear that when you gather together in \add the\add* assembly, there are divisions among you all, and I partly believe it
\v 19 because there must be differences among you to show who out of all of you are approved.
\v 20 So then, when you gather together in one place, it's not to \add celebrate by\add* eating the master's dinner
\v 21 because during the meal, everyone \add grabs\add* their own food without considering others. So some people remain hungry while others have too much to drink.
\v 22 For eating and drinking, don't you all have your own houses to do that in? Why are you showing contempt for God's assembly and humiliating those \add left with\add* nothing? What should I say about that? Should I praise you for that? \add No,\add* I can't!
\rem /s1 The Institution of the Lord's Supper
\p
\v 23 I've \add already\add* passed on to all of you everything that I received from the master: that on the night when he was betrayed, he took some bread
\v 24 and after giving thanks, he broke \add off a piece\add* and said, “This \add represents\add* my body which \add will be\add* broken for your sakes. Keep doing this in memory of me.”
\v 25 Similarly, after the dinner he took the cup and said, “This cup \add represents\add* the new agreement \add which will be sealed\add* by my blood. As often as you all \add celebrate\add*, drink it in memory of me.”\x + \xo 11:25: a \xt Exo 24:8; Jer 31:31-34; \xo b \xt Exo 24:6-8.\x*
\v 26 Because as often as you all \add celebrate by\add* eating bread and drinking from the cup, you'll continue to announce the \nd master's\nd* death until he returns.
\rem /s1 Partaking of the Supper Unworthily
\p
\v 27 Therefore, anyone who eats that bread or drinks from the \nd master's\nd* cup in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the \nd master\nd*.
\v 28 So everyone must first examine themself as part of eating that bread and drinking from that cup,
\v 29 because anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body,\f + \fr 11:29 \ft Discern/distinguish/recognise their own body? The master's body? The whole group as a body? Unfortunately, we can't ask Paul exactly what he meant here.\f* eats and drinks judgement onto themself.
\v 30 Because of that, many among you are weak and sick, and many have passed away,
\v 31 but if we were examining ourselves, we wouldn't be judged.
\v 32 However, when we're judged by \nd Yahweh\nd*, we're being disciplined so that we won't be condemned along with the unbelievers.
\p
\v 33 So brothers and sisters, when you come together to celebrate this, wait for each other.
\v 34 If anyone's hungry, they should eat at home \add beforehand\add*, so that your meetings won't lead to judgement. I'll give instructions about other matters when I get there.

\v 13 \add Yes,\add* in one spirit we were all immersed into one body, whether \add we were\add* Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we all were given one spirit to drink. MEANING?
\p
\v 14 \add Yes,\add* indeed the body is not one part, but many.
\v 15 If \add your\add* foot said, “Since I'm not a hand, I'm not part of the body,” that wouldn't make it any less a part of the body,
\v 16 and if \add your\add* ear said, “Since I'm not an eye, I'm not part of the body,” that wouldn't make it any less a part of the body.
\v 17 If \add your\add* whole body was an eye, how could \add you\add* hear? \add But then,\add* if \add your\add* whole body was an ear, how could \add you\add* smell \add anything\add*?
\v 18 Actually, \nd God\nd* has placed every part in our bodies \add exactly\add* where he wanted to put them.
\v 19 If it was all just one part, how could it be a body?
\v 20 \add Yes,\add* there's many parts, but \add only\add* one body.
\p
\v 21 \add Your\add* eye can't tell \add your\add* hand, “I don't need you,” and \add your\add* head can't tell \add your\add* feet, “I don't need you.”
\v 22 On the contrary, the body parts that seem to be weaker are \add very\add* vital,
\v 23 and those body parts that seem less honourable, we give them greater honour and hence our unpresentable body parts are \add treated with\add* more modesty.
\v 24 Our presentable parts don't have any need for that, but rather \nd God\nd* has put the body together and he gave greater honour to the lesser parts
\v 25 so that there won't be any division in the body, but its members should care equally for each other.
\v 26 So if one body part is hurting, all the parts hurt as well. If one body part is honoured, then all the parts are happy together.
\p
\v 27 Now you all are the body of Christ, and each of you is a part of it.
\v 28 And indeed, \nd God\nd* has appointed: 1/ missionaries, 2/ prophets, 3/ teachers, then \add doing\add* miracles, healing \add others\add*, helping \add others\add*, guiding \add others\add*, \add and speaking\add* various languages\x + \xo 12:28: \xt Eph 4:11.\x*
\v 29 Are everyone missionaries, or everyone prophets or teachers, or doing miracles?
\v 30 Does everyone have the gifts of healing, or speaking in other languages, or translating?
\p
\v 31 But strive for the better gifts.
\rem /s1 Love Is the Greatest
\p And now I'll demonstrate a better way to you all:
\c 13
\s1 Love expounded
\rem /s1 The Gift of Love
\p
\v 1 Even if I could speak in human languages as well as the languages of \add God's\add* messengers, but didn't love \add others\add*, then I'd \add just\add* be like a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
\v 2 And if have \add the ability of being able\add* to prophesy and could understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I had total faith so I could tell mountains to move, but I didn't love \add others\add*, then I'm \add of no use to anyone\add*.\x + \xo 13:2: \xt Mat 17:20; 21:21; Mrk 11:23.\x*
\v 3 Even if I gave everything I have \add to the poor\add*, and even sacrifice my body so that I could boast, but didn't love \add others\add*, it wouldn't be any use to me.
\p
\v 4 Love is patient and kind. It doesn't envy \add others\add*, it doesn't boast, and it isn't arrogant.
\v 5 It isn't crude, it doesn't just care about itself, it doesn't get angry quickly, and it doesn't keep records about who wrongs \add us\add*.
\v 6 Love isn't happy with disobeying \add God\add*, but is happy about the truth.
\v 7 It tolerates everything, believes everything, is always hopeful about everything, and always perseveres.
\p
\v 8 Love never fails, unlike prophecies that will come to nothing, languages that will die out, and knowledge that \add also\add* will come to nothing,
\v 9 because we only have partial knowledge and partial \add understanding\add* of prophecy.
\v 10 So when perfection comes, partial things will disappear.
\p
\v 11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, and reasoned like a child, \add but\add* then when I became an adult, I set childish things aside.
\v 12 \add In this present age\add*, we see like fuzzy reflections in a mirror, but \add in the future\add*, we'll see \add God\add* face to face. In this age, I have partial knowledge, but then it'll be complete, just like \em we'll be known\em* completely.
\p
\v 13 But for now, these three continue: faith, hope, and love, but love is the greatest one of those.
\c 14
\s1 Comparing prophesying with speaking in other languages
\rem /s1 The Gifts of Tongues and Prophecy; Gifts of Prophecy and Tongues; More about Gifts from the Spirit
\p
\v 1 Aim to \add show\add* love, and eagerly strive for spiritual \add things\add*—especially the ability to prophesy,
\v 2 because anyone speaking another language isn't speaking to \add the\add* people, but to \nd God\nd*, because no one understands \add it\add*, but they're speaking \add about\add* spiritual mysteries.
\v 3 However, anyone who's prophesying, speaks to \add the\add* people for their instruction and encouragement and comfort.
\v 4 Anyone who's speaking in another language instructs themself, but when \add people\add* prophesy, they're instructing the \add whole\add* assembly.
\p
\v 5 Now I'd like it if you all spoke in other languages, but I'd like it better if you could all be prophesying. The person prophesying is more helpful than someone speaking in other languages, unless they translate so that the assembly can be instructed.
\v 6 But now brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in other languages, how can I be of benefit to you all? Only if I share a revelation with you all, or some knowledge, or a prophecy or teaching.
\p
\v 7 Even the tune coming from non-living things like musical instruments can't be recognised unless the distinct notes can be distinguished,
\v 8 because if the trumpet produces an unclear sound, how will \add the soldiers\add* know to prepare for battle.
\v 9 Similarly with all of you—unless your words are intelligible, how will anyone know what you're saying? You'll just be talking to the wind.
\v 10 There's certainly many different languages in the world, but none of them are without meaning,
\v 11 so if I don't know the meaning of someone's language, I'm a foreigner to that person, and that person \add will be\add* a foreigner to me
\v 12 and it's the same with all of you. Because you all want spiritual \add things\add* in order to help grow the assembly, then strive to have many \add of them\add*.
\p
\v 13 So then, let anyone who's speaking in another language, pray that they will be able to translate \add it\add*.
\v 14 When I pray in another language, my spirit prays but my mind is unproductive,
\v 15 so what should I do? \add Well,\add* I'll pray with my spirit, but I'll also pray with my mind. I'll sing with my spirit, but I'll also sing with my mind.
\v 16 Otherwise, if you \add speak out\add*a blessing in the spirit, how can the ordinary \add listeners\add* say ‘May it be so’ after you give thanks, since they wouldn't know what you've been saying.
\v 17 \add Yes,\add* you'd certainly give thanks well, but the other \add people\add* wouldn't be encouraged.
\p
\v 18 I thank \nd God\nd* that I speak in other language more than all of you,
\v 19 but with the assembly, I'd prefer to speak five words with my mind so that I can instruct others, rather than thousands of words in another language.
\p
\v 20 Brothers and sisters, don't be childish in your thinking. You all can be like infants with respect to \em evil\em*, but \add in everything else\add*, be mature in your thinking.
\v 21 \add The prophet Isayah\add* wrote:\x + \xo 14:21: \xt Isa 28:11-12.\x*
\q1 ‘I'll speak to this nation
\q2 through foreign languages and strangers' lips,
\q1 but even then they won't listen to me,’
\m says \nd Yahweh\nd*.
\v 22 So then, \add speaking\add* in other languages is a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers. However \add in contrast,\add* prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for believers.
\p
\v 23 So if the whole assembly gathered together at the same place and they all spoke in other languages, and then some inquirers or unbelievers came in, wouldn't they say that you're all crazy?
\v 24 But if they were all prophesying \add instead\add* and some inquirers or unbelievers came in, they'd be convicted \add of their sinfulness\add* and called to account by them all.
\v 25 \add The prophecies\add* would expose the secrets of their hearts, so then they'd bow down and worship God, and exclaim, “God is really \add here\add* among you all!”
\s1 The correct means of worshipping
\rem /s1 Orderly Worship; Order in the Church; A Call to Orderly Worship
\p
\v 26 So brothers and sisters, what should we say then? When you all gather together, each one of you brings a song or a teaching, or \add explains\add* a revelation, or \add has a message\add* in another language or has \add the\add* translation. Let everything you do \add be aimed at growing the faith of the hearers\add*.
\v 27 If there's any speaking in other languages, \add it should be\add* two or three \add people\add* at most, taking turns and someone should translate.
\v 28 But if there's no translator, they should be silent in the assembly, and \add save it\add* for between themselves and \nd God\nd*.
\v 29 But let two or three \add people\add* prophesy, and then the others should evaluate what was said.
\v 30 However if something is revealed to someone still seated, then the first person should \add stop speaking\add*,
\v 31 because you can all prophesy in turn so that everyone can be instructed and encouraged.
\v 32 The prophet's spirits are under the control of the prophets,
\v 33 because God isn't \add a god\add* of disorder, but of peace.
\p As in all the assemblies of believers,
\v 34 the women should stay silent in the assemblies, because they're not permitted to speak, but must be in submission as \add Mosheh's\add* law says.
\v 35 But if they want to know more about anything, they should ask their own husbands at home, because it's shameful for a woman to speak in the assembly.
\p
\v 36 Did God's message \em originate\em* from you all, or did it only \em come\em* to you?
\v 37 If anyone thinks they're a prophet or a spiritual \add person\add*, then they should \add readily\add* acknowledge that what I'm writing to you all is \nd Yahweh's\nd* command,
\v 38 but if anyone's ignorant, then let them stay ignorant.
\p
\v 39 So brothers and sisters, strive to \add be able to\add* prophesy, and don't forbid the speaking of other languages,
\v 40 but let everything be done properly and orderly.
\c 15
\s1 The messiah's resurrection
\rem /s1 The resurrection of the dead; The Resurrection of Christ
\p
\v 1 Now brothers and sisters, I want to remind you all about the good message that I preached to you, which you then received and now \add base your faith\add* on.
\v 2 You're all saved by that good message if you hold firmly to what I preached to you, \add assuming\add* that you didn't just \add ‘say that’ you\add* believe.
\p
\v 3 \add Yes,\add* first of all, I passed onto you all what I \add myself\add* had received: that \nd Messiah\nd* died for our sins as the scriptures \add had predicted\add*,\x + \xo 15:3: \xt Isa 53:5-12.\x*
\v 4 and that he was buried and then brought back to life on the third day as per the scriptures \add again\add*,\x + \xo 15:4: \xt Psa 16:8-10; Mat 12:40; Acts 2:24-32.\x*
\v 5 and that he was seen by Cephas and then by the twelve.\x + \xo 15:5: a \xt Luk 24:34; \xo b \xt Mat 28:16-17; Mrk 16:14; Luk 24:36; Yhn 20:19.\x*
\v 6 Then he was seen by more than 500 believers at once—most of whom are still living, although some have already passed away.
\v 7 Then he was seen by Yacob, and then by all the ambassadors.
\p
\v 8 Then last of all, as if I'd been born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also,\x + \xo 15:8: \xt Acts 9:3-6.\x*
\v 9 because I'm the least of the ambassadors—quite unworthy of that title because I persecuted God's assembly.\x + \xo 15:9: \xt Acts 8:3.\x*
\v 10 But I am what I am thanks to God's grace, as his grace towards me hasn't been wasted. Actually, I worked harder than all \add the others\add*, although \add of course\add* it wasn't really me, but God's grace with me.
\v 11 \add Anyway,\add* whether it was me or them, we \add all\add* preach \add that same good message\add*, and that's how you all came to belief.
\s1 Life after death
\rem /s1 Our Resurrection; The Resurrection of the Dead
\p
\v 12 Now if \add the message\add* declares that \nd Messiah\nd* was killed and then raised back to life, how come some of you are saying that no one comes back to life?
\v 13 If no one who's dead comes back to life, then \nd Messiah\nd* couldn't have come back to life,
\v 14 and if \nd Messiah\nd* hasn't come back to life, then our preaching is meaningless and so is your faith!
\v 15 Not only that, it would make us into fraudsters lying about God, because we've testified that God brought \nd Messiah\nd* back to life, but that can't be true if the dead can't come back to life.
\v 16 Because if the dead don't come back to life, then \nd Messiah\nd* can't have come back to life,
\v 17 but if \nd Messiah\nd* didn't come back to life, then your faith is wasted and you're all still \add just unforgiven\add* sinners.
\v 18 Again, if that's the case, those believers who've passed away \add simply\add* perished.
\v 19 If our hope in \nd Messiah\nd* only \add applies\add* to this life, then we should be pitied more than \nd anyone\nd* else.
\p
\v 20 But \nd Messiah\nd* has indeed come back to life from the dead, leading the way for those who have passed away,
\v 21 because since death came through a man \add (Adam)\add*, then the resurrection of the dead also comes through a man \add (Yeshua)\add*.
\v 22 Just as everyone who's in Adam will die, so everyone who's in \nd Messiah\nd* will come back to life,
\v 23 but each in his own turn: first \nd Messiah\nd* will be leading, then when he \add returns\add*, those who belong to him.
\v 24 Then the end will come when he hands over the kingship to \nd God\nd* the Father after he's destroyed all rule, and all authority and power,
\v 25 because he must reign until he's defeated all his enemies.\x + \xo 15:25: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*
\v 26 The final enemy to be abolished will be death itself
\v 27 because \add (as David wrote)\add*,\x + \xo 15:27: \xt Psa 8:6.\x* ‘God has made everything subject to him.’ (Now when it says ‘everything’, \add of course\add* that doesn't include \add God\add* who's the one that made it happen.)
\v 28 And when everything has been put under his control, then the son himself will submit to the one who subjected everything to him, so that \nd God\nd* \add will be in total control\add*.
\p
\v 29 Otherwise, what will the people do who are being immersed \add in water\add* for the dead? If the dead don't come back to life, why would they get immersed for them? TODO: WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
\v 30 \add As for us,\add* why do we \add place ourselves\add* in danger all the time?
\v 31 I'm dying every day by your boasting brothers and sisters, which I have in \nd Messiah Yeshua\nd* our \nd master\nd*. TODO: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
\v 32 If I fought with wild animals at Ephesus for human \add purposes\add*, what did I gain? If the dead aren't brought back to life, then ‘Let's eat and drink, because tomorrow we'll die \add anyway\add*.’\x + \xo 15:32: \xt Isa 22:13.\x*
\p
\v 33 Don't be fooled: ‘Evil conversations corrupt good character.’
\v 34 Sober up as you should, and stop sinning, because some of you are \add quite\add* ignorant about \nd God\nd*. (I say that to your shame.)
\s1 Our new immortal bodies
\rem /s1 The Resurrection Body
\p
\v 35 But someone will ask, “How do the dead come back to life and what kind of body will they \add have then\add*?”
\v 36 Silly question! \add Plants\add* don't come to life unless the seed dies \add first\add*.
\v 37 And you don't sow the plants, but you sow the bare seeds—perhaps of wheat or something else—
\v 38 then \nd God\nd* gives it a body just like he wants, so each seed gets its own \add new\add* body.
\p
\v 39 Not all bodies are the same: humans have one kind of body, animals have different ones, birds different again, and fish also different.
\p
\v 40 There are also heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the beauty of heavenly bodies and of earthly \add bodies\add* are \add quite\add* different.
\v 41 The sun, the moon, and the stars all have their own different types of beauty, and even the beauty of stars differs from one to another.
\p
\v 42 So too it is with the resurrection of the dead. The decaying body is ‘sown’ \add into the ground\add*, but the raised \add body\add* is immortal.
\v 43 It's ‘sown’ in dishonour but it's raised in splendour. It's ‘sown’ in weakness but it's raised in power.
\v 44 It's ‘sown’ a natural body but it's raised as a spiritual body. (If there's a natural body, there's also a spiritual body.)
\v 45 As it's also written:\x + \xo 15:45: \xt Gen 2:7.\x* ‘The first Adam became a living being.’ The last ‘Adam’ is a life-giving spirit,
\v 46 but the spiritual doesn't come first—it's first the natural and \em then\em* the spiritual.
\v 47 The first man was made of dust from the earth—the second man \add came\add* from heaven.
\v 48 Earthly people are like \add that\add* earthly man, and heavenly people are like \add that\add* heavenly man.
\p
\v 49 And just like we carry the image of \add that\add* earthly man, we should also bear the image of \add that\add* heavenly man.
\v 50 Now brothers and sisters, I can tell you all that our \add present physical bodies\add* can't inherit God's kingdom, and nor can corrupt \add things\add* inherit immortality.
\p
\v 51 Listen, I'm explaining a mystery to you all. Not all of us will pass away, but we will all be changed\x + \xo 15:51-52: \xt 1Th 4:15-17.\x*
\v 52 in an instant, a \add millisecond\add*, at the last trumpet because the trumpet will sound and the dead will come back to living as immortals, and we'll be changed.
\v 53 \add Yes,\add* it's essential for this perishable \add body\add* to become incorruptible and for this mortal to become immortal.
\v 54 But when this perishable \add body\add* becomes incorruptible and this mortal becomes immortal, then what was written will come true:\x + \xo 15:54: \xt Isa 25:8.\x* ‘Death is replaced by victory.’
\q1
\v 55 \x + \xo 15:55: \xt Hos 13:14 (LXX).\x*‘Death, where is your victory?
\q1 \add Yes\add* death, where is your sting?’
\m
\v 56 Sin is the sting of death, and sin's power is The Law,
\v 57 but be thankful to \nd God\nd* because it's him who gives us the victory through our \nd master Yeshua Messiah\nd*.
\p
\v 58 Therefore my dear brothers and sisters, be strong and stand firm, always doing the \nd master's\nd* work enthusiastically, knowing that your work for \nd Yahweh\nd* isn't wasted.
