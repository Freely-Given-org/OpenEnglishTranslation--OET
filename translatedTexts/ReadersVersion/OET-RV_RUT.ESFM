\is1 Introduction
\ip This account tells us about what happened back in the time when the ‘Judges’ were still ruling Israel, i.e., before their first king. At that time, a long drought caused a famine in Israel, which in turned cause Elimelek to move his family to the country of Moab. After a time, Elimelek died there in Moab, but eventually their two sons married, and this account focuses on Ruth who was one of those wives. When Ruth's husband also died, she displayed amazing love and dedication towards her mother-in-law, Naomi. When good blessed Israel again with good crops. Naomi returned back to her roots in Israel and Ruth accompanied her. According to Jewish customs, Ruth needed to marry a relative of her husband, so that Elimelek's name could continue. This was Boaz, and the son they bore became an ancestor of the future King David, and eventually through time, of Yeshua the messiah.
\ip The previous \bk Account of the Judges\bk* tells about how much the Jewish people suffered because they had turned away from God. So this account reveals how Ruth, a non-Jew, is blessed after she begins to follow Israel's God.
\ip Note that the Hebrew name of the main character in this account is ‘רוּת’ which might be transliterated as ‘Rūt’ (and pronounced as ‘root’ with no ‘th’ at the end). However in weighing up the pros and cons, we have elected to use the traditional spelling of ‘Ruth’ (rather than ‘Rut’ which might would be more accurate in one sense, yet would most likely also be pronounced wrongly by most English speakers).

\v 1 \add Back\add* in the time when the judges¦123783 ruled \add Israel\add*, there was \add a drought which caused\add* a shortage of food, so a man¦123788 from \add the town of\add* Bethlehem in \add the region of\add* Yudah¦123791 went¦123787 to live in the country¦123793 of Moab¦123794 \add for a while\add*, taking his wife and their two¦123797 sons¦123798.
\v 2 The man's name was Elimelek and he was married to Naomi¦123805, and their sons' names were Mahlon¦123811 and Kilion. (They were part of \add the clan of\add* Ephrathah¦123813 from Bethlehem in Yudah¦123816.) They travelled to the Moab¦123820 countryside and lived there¦123823.
\v 3 Then¦123825 Naomi's¦123828 husband¦123827 Elimelek¦123826 died¦123825, and she¦123830 was left with her¦123832 two¦123831 sons¦123832.
\v 4 \add Eventually\add* they¦123844 married women from there¦123845 in Moab—Orpah¦123840 and Ruth¦123843. But¦123834 after \add Naomi and her sons\add* had lived¦123844 in Moab for about¦123846 then years¦123847,
\v 5 Mahlon¦123853 and Kilion both also died¦123849, and Naomi was left without¦123857 her husband¦123859 or her two¦123857 sons¦123858.
\s1 Ruth accompanies Naomi back to Bethlehem

\p
\v 6 \add One day\add* Naomi was in a field there in Moab¦123866 when she heard¦123868 someone telling about how Yahweh¦123874 had helped his people¦123877 in Israel and that now they had plenty of food, so she got ready to return¦123864 \add to Bethlehem\add* with her¦123863 \add two\add* daughters-in-law¦123863.
\v 7 The three of them left the place¦123885 where¦123886 they'd been living \add in Moab\add* and \add started walking\add* along the road back to Yudah¦123899.
\v 8 Then¦123901 Naomi¦123902 said¦123901 to her¦123904 two¦123903 daughters-in-law¦123904, “Both of you should go¦123905 back to your parents' homes. \add I pray that\add* Yahweh¦123912 will treat you with the same faithfulness that you showed to your now-deceased husbands and to me.
\v 9 May Yahweh¦123923 enable \add both\add* of you¦123924 to find new husbands¦123929 and find peace and happiness in your new homes with them.”
\p Then she kissed¦123930 them as they all wept aloud.
\v 10 But¦123936 they both said¦123936, “No, we'll go with you¦123941 to return¦123942 to your¦123943 relatives.”
\p
\v 11 But¦123945 Naomi¦123946 responded¦123945, “No, go¦123950 back to your homes my daughters¦123948. Why would you¦123950 bother coming with me? It's not like I could still give birth to \add more\add* sons¦123955 to become your husbands¦123959.
\v 12 Go on back, my daughters¦123962, because I'm too old to remarry. Even if I did hope for that and got married tonight and had \add some\add* sons¦123980,
\v 13 could you wait for them to grow up \add so you could be remarried\add*? No, my daughters¦123994, what's hard for me, even more than your hardships, is that Yahweh¦124008 is using his power against me.”
\p
\v 14 Then¦124010 they wailed and cried again¦124013, and Orpah¦124015 kissed¦124014 her¦124016 mother-in-law¦124016 \add goodbye and left\add*, but Ruth¦124017 \add stayed and\add* clung¦124018 to Naomi.
\v 15 Naomi said¦124021, “Look, your sister-in-law is going back to her parents and to her religion. Go back with her.”
\p
\v 16 But¦124035 Ruth¦124036 replied, “\add Please\add* don't¦124037 insist that I leave¦124042 you and go back, because wherever you go, I'll go \add with you\add* and wherever you live, I'll live \add there too\add*. Your people \add will be\add* my people, and your God \add will be\add* my God.
\v 17 Wherever you die, I'll die there \add too\add* and be buried¦124063 there. Maybe Yahweh¦124066 punish me severely if anything other than death¦124071 separates¦124072 the two of us.”
\p
\v 18 When \add Naomi\add* saw¦124076 that Ruth was determined¦124079 to go¦124081 with her, she¦124080 didn't say any more.
\p
\v 19 So¦124087 the two¦124088 of them travelled on until¦124089 they reached Bethlehem. When they entered Bethlehem, the whole town was curious about them, and the women began asking, “Is that Naomi¦124105?”
\p
\v 20 But¦124107 Naomi told them not to call her ‘Naomi’ (which means ‘pleasant’) but to call her ‘Mara’ (meaning ‘bitter’) because she said¦124107, “The almighty¦124120 \add God\add* has made my life very bitter.
\v 21 I went away content \add with a family\add*, but Yahweh has brought me back with a void. So why call me ‘Naomi¦124133’? You see, Yahweh has testified¦124135 against me—the almighty¦124137 \add God\add* has brought misfortune on me.”
\p
\v 22 And so Naomi¦124144 had returned¦124143, along with her¦124147 daughter-in-law¦124147, Ruth¦124145 the Moabitess, and they arrived there in Bethlehem at the start of the barley¦124158 harvest¦124157.

\s1 Ruth collects grain in Boaz' field
\rem /s1 Ruth and Boaz; Ruth Works in the Field of Boaz; Ruth Meets Boaz; Ruth Works in Boaz's Field
\p
\v 1 Now there was a relative¦124161 there of Naomi's deceased husband. His name¦124169 was Boaz¦124170 and he was a very wealthy¦124166 man¦124164 from the same clan as Elimelek had been.
\v 2 Ruth¦124173 the Moabitess said to Naomi¦124177, “Allow me to go to the field¦124181 and pick up any heads of grain¦124186 that the harvesters drop.\x + \xo 2:2: \xt Lev 19:9-10; Deu 24:19.\x* I'll follow any harvester who seems kind.”
\p “go ahead, my daughter¦124199,” Naomi replied.
\p
\v 3 So¦124201 Ruth left and went to the field where she picked up heads of grain after the harvesters, and it just so happened¦124207 that that part of the field belonged¦124211 to Boaz¦124211 who was Elimelek's relative.
\p
\v 4 Just then, Boaz¦124218 arrived from the town and greeted the harvesters, “May Yahweh be with you,” to which they replied, “May Yahweh bless¦124228 you \add also\add*.”
\p
\v 5 Then¦124231 he asked the foreman of the harvesters, “Whose¦124232 \add daughter\add* is that young¦124239 woman¦124239 \add over there¦124237\add*?”
\p
\v 6 “She's a young¦124249 Moabitess,” the man replied. “The one who came¦124252 with Naomi¦124255 when she¦124251 returned from Moab¦124257.
\v 7 She asked me \add for permission\add* to follow the harvesters and pick up any heads of grain that drop, and she's been doing it since¦124269 early morning¦124270 until just recently she's taking a break now in the shelter¦124276.
\p
\v 8 So¦124279 Boaz¦124280 \add approached\add* Ruth¦124283, “Young woman,” he said¦124279, “listen here. Don't leave this place or go¦124289 to any other field¦124291 to pick up grain, but just stay¦124298 close by these young¦124301 female workers of mine.
\v 9 Watch where \add the men\add* are harvesting and follow along behind them. I've told them not to bother you. And whenever you're thirsty, help yourself from the water jars that the men keep filled.”
\p
\v 10 Then¦124330 she knelt down on the ground and bowed¦124334 her¦124333 head low to the ground and said¦124336, “Why are you being so kind to me when I'm a foreigner¦124347? I wasn't expecting your¦124341 attention.”
\p
\v 11 “People have told me,” Boaz¦124350 replied, “about everything you've done for your mother-in-law¦124362 since your husband died—how you left your parents and your homeland behind and came¦124374 here to live with people¦124377 that you hadn't even met before.
\v 12 May Yahweh reward your¦124389 \add hard\add* work. Since you've come¦124397 \add here\add* for protection under¦124399 Israel's¦124394 God¦124393 Yahweh, may he reward you in full.”
\p
\v 13 “My lord,” she replied, “I trust that I'll continue to please you because¦124411 you've comforted¦124410 me by speaking so kindly to me, your servant, even though I'm not like your servant girls.”
\p
\v 14 Then¦124423 when it was time¦124426 to eat, Boaz¦124425 told Ruth, “Come and join us. Take some bread¦124433 and dip it in the sauce and eat.” So¦124423 she sat beside the harvesters, and he \add also\add* offered¦124440 her some roasted¦124443 grain¦124443. She ate¦124444 until she was full and \add even\add* had some left over.
\v 15 Then¦124448 she¦124459 went back to picking up heads and Boaz¦124451 ordered his men¦124454, “Let¦124452 her gather grain even among the bundles and don't¦124460 shame her.
\v 16 Even pull some \add stalks\add* out from the bundles¦124470 and drop them for her to pick up, and don't¦124473 tell her off.”
\p
\v 17 So¦124478 \add Ruth¦124484\add* picked up grain in the field¦124479 until¦124480 evening¦124482 and when she beat the heads and collected the grains, she had a large basket of barley¦124490.
\v 18 So¦124492 she picked¦124492 up the basket and headed back into town and showed her mother-in-law¦124496 how much she had collected. Ruth also gave¦124502 Naomi the roasted grain left-over from her lunch.
\v 19 “Where did you pick up grain today and where did you work?” asked Naomi. “May the man who took notice¦124520 of you be blessed¦124521.”
\p So¦124511 she told her¦124513 mother-in-law¦124513 where she had worked, “The name of the man I worked with today is Boaz¦124536.”
\p
\v 20 “May he be blessed¦124541 by Yahweh,” responded¦124538 Naomi¦124539. “Yahweh \em hasn't\em* forgotten his kindness¦124548 towards \add us who are still\add* living¦124551 and \add to our husbands who've\add* died.” And then she added, “That man¦124560 is a close relative \add of Elimelek\add*. \add In fact,\add* he's one of those responsible for taking care of our family.”\x + \xo 2:20: \xt Lev 25:25.\x*
\p
\v 21 “He also told me,” said Ruth¦124565 the Moabitess, “to stay with his workers until¦124580 they finish the harvesting¦124587.”
\p
\v 22 “It's¦124596 good¦124598, my daughter,” said¦124592 Naomi¦124593 to her¦124597 daughter-in-law, “for you to stay near his servant girls because you don't¦124605 know how people¦124606 might treat you in another¦124610 field¦124609.”
\p
\v 23 So¦124612 Ruth stayed¦124612 near Boaz' servant girls and picked up heads of grain until¦124616 the end of the barley¦124621 harvest and \add then\add* the wheat¦124623 harvest, and she lived¦124624 with her¦124627 mother-in-law¦124627.

\s1 Ruth requests Boaz to assume his responsibilities
\rem /s1 Ruth at the Threshing Floor; Ruth and Boaz at the Threshing Floor; Ruth Finds a Husband
\p
\v 1 One day Ruth's mother-in-law¦124632 Naomi¦124631 said¦124629 to her¦124632, “My daughter¦124633, I think I need to be finding a secure living situation for you?
\v 2 Now, Boaz¦124646 whose¦124652 servant girls you've been working with, he's a relative of ours. In fact, he'll be on the threshing¦124659 floor¦124659 winnowing¦124656 barley¦124660 tonight.
\v 3 So¦124663 wash yourself¦124675 and put on some perfume. Wear your¦124667 cloak and go¦124670 out to the threshing¦124672 floor¦124672, but don't¦124673 let him know you're there until¦124677 he's finished¦124678 eating¦124679 and drinking¦124680.
\v 4 Then when he lies down \add to sleep\add*, pay attention to where¦124688 he lies down. \add Once he's asleep,\add* go¦124692 and lift the blanket near his feet¦124694 and lie down. Then he'll tell you what to do \add next\add*.”
\p
\v 5 “I'll do everything you¦124710 say,” Ruth answered,
\v 6 then she went¦124714 out to the threshing¦124715 floor¦124715 and¦124716 did everything her¦124721 mother-in-law¦124721 had instructed¦124720.
\p
\v 7 When Boaz¦124724 had finished eating and drinking and was feeling cheery, he went¦124728 off to lie down at the end¦124730 of the pile of grain¦124731. Then¦124723 Ruth quietly¦124733 followed him, and uncovered¦124734 his feet¦124735 and lay down \add there\add*.
\v 8 But¦124738 Boaz was startled¦124741 in the middle¦124739 of the night¦124740, and when he turned¦124743 over he was stunned to find a woman¦124745 lying¦124746 at his feet¦124747.
\v 9 “Who are you?” he asked.
\p “I'm your servant¦124762 Ruth,” she replied, “Spread your cloak¦124759 over me\f + \fr 3:9 \ft This was the cultural way for Ruth to request Boaz to take her as his wife.\f* because you have a responsibility as our close relative.”
\p
\v 10 “My dear girl, may Yahweh¦124770 bless¦124768 you.” Boaz replied, “You have shown more kindness¦124773 now that before,\f + \fr 3:10 \ft Probably referring to Ruth's faithfulness to her mother-in-law.\f* because you haven't chased after¦124781 the young¦124782 men¦124782, whether¦124783 rich or poor.
\v 11 So¦124790 now dear girl, don't¦124792 be afraid. I'll¦124799 do what you've asked for, because the whole town knows that you're¦124798 an honourable woman¦124809.
\v 12 It is true that I have a responsibility towards your family,\x + \xo 3:12: \xt Ruth 2:20.\x* but there's¦124822 another man who's more closely related \add to you all\add* than me.
\v 13 Stay here for the rest of the night¦124829, and then in the morning, if he'll accept then he can \add marry\add* you. But if he's not willing¦124840 \add to take care of you\add*, then as Yahweh¦124846 lives, I'll do it myself. Now lie down here until¦124848 morning.”
\p
\v 14 So¦124852 \add Ruth\add* lay \add there\add* near his feet¦124853 until¦124859 morning¦124861, but she¦124876 got up before¦124863 it was light enough to be recognised¦124865 as Boaz had said¦124870, “\add It's best\add* if no one knows that a woman¦124877 visited the threshing¦124878 floor¦124878.”
\v 15 Then Boaz said¦124880, “Bring your cloak¦124882 here and hold it out.” So¦124880 she held it while he poured a generous amount of barley¦124894 into it, and lifted it onto her \add shoulder\add*. Then \add ?he or she\add*\f + \fr 3:15 \ft TC: There's no separate Hebrew word for ‘he’ or ‘she’ here—it's part of the verb ‘he/she_went’ but it's unclear if this original verb was marked \it masculine\it* or \it feminine\it*, hence you'll find both alternatives in various Bible translations.\f* went¦124897 into the town.
\v 16 When Ruth got home, her mother-in-law¦124903 asked her, “My daughter¦124908, \add how did everything go\add*?”
\p So¦124900 Ruth told her everything that Boaz \add had said¦124904 and\add* done for her
\v 17 and she also said, “He¦124928 gave¦124926 me all this barley¦124924 because he told me that he didn't¦124931 want me to return to my mother-in-law¦124937 empty-handed¦124934.”
\p
\v 18 “\add Okay\add* my daughter¦124941,” Naomi responded¦124939. “Wait \add now\add* until we see what happens, because that man¦124951 won't¦124949 rest today until the matter¦124947 gets settled.”

\p
\v 1 \add Meanwhile,\add* Boaz went to \add the place inside\add* the town gate \add (where people conducted their official business)\add* and sat down there¦124964. Just as he had hoped, the man responsible for Naomi's family came along—the man whom Boaz had mentioned earlier—and Boaz called out to him by name and said, “Come over here and sit down.” So¦124960 the man came over and sat down.
\v 2 Then¦124982 Boaz called over ten¦124983 of the older, well-respected men¦124984 from the town and asked them to sit¦124988 \add and witness their discussion\add*, so they sat¦124991 down \add with them\add*.
\v 3 Then¦124993 Boaz asked the other relative, “The part of the field¦124996 that belonged to our¦124998 relative Elimelek is for sale. Naomi¦125001, who \add recently\add* returned from Moab¦125004, is selling it.
\v 4 I thought that I should tell you \add about it\add* and \add in case\add* you buy \add the land\add* while the people sitting¦125013 here are listening, including these leaders of our people. If you want to buy it back into the family, then do so. But¦125006 if you do not want to buy it back, then let me know, because you are the closest relative to Elimelek, and I am next after¦125034 you.”
\p “I'll buy it,” the man replied.
\p
\v 5 “When you buy the land from Naomi¦125046,” Boaz¦125040 continued, “you will also need to marry Ruth¦125048, our deceased relative's widow from Moab, so that she'll have a son who will inherit¦125061 the property and continue Elimelek's family line.”
\p
\v 6 “I can't buy it back myself, then,” the closer relative answered. “If I did that, I would ruin my own son's inheritance¦125076. You can have the land and the woman instead of me, because I \add simply\add* can't take it.”
\p
\v 7 (At that time in Israel, people had a different way of buying \add land\add* or exchanging¦125098 \add goods between them\add*. In order to make these matters¦125102 legally binding, one man would take off one of his sandals¦125105 and¦125106 give it to the other¦125107 party. That was the way people in Israel confirmed¦125099 what they had agreed to do.)\x + \xo 4:7-8: \xt Deu 25:9.\x*
\p
\v 8 “You buy it yourself,” the relative said¦125112 and he took off one of his sandals¦125119 \add and gave it to Boaz¦125114\add*.
\v 9 Then¦125121 Boaz¦125122 said¦125121 to the respected men and to all the other people¦125126 who were there, “Today you¦125128 have all witnessed¦125127 that I've bought from Naomi¦125145 all the property that belonged to Elimelek, Kilion, and Mahlon¦125143.
\v 10 I am also taking Ruth¦125150, Mahlon's¦125153 widow from Moab, to be my wife so that she can have a son. Everyone will consider that son to be Elimelek's descendant and he will inherit¦125163 the property and carry on Elimelek's family name among¦125170 his relatives¦125171 and here in his hometown.\x + \xo 4:10: \xt Deu 25:5-6.\x* You've seen and heard that today \add and can tell anyone who asks about it\add*.”
\p
\v 11 All the respected men, and the others who were sitting at the town gate, agreed, and they said¦125178, “Yes, \add we¦125186 are your\add*. We pray that Yahweh¦125188 will allow this woman¦125191 who will be coming¦125192 into your home, to be like Rachel¦125196 and Leah¦125198, the two who gave birth to our ancestors and started our people¦125181, Israel¦125205.\x + \xo 4:11: \xt Gen 29:31.\x* May you become great in the clan of Ephrathah¦125209 and famous here in Bethlehem!
\v 12 We pray that your family will be like the family of your ancestor Perez¦125219, son of Judah and Tamar¦125223, because of the many descendants that Yahweh¦125230 will give¦125229 to you and this young¦125234 woman¦125234.”\x + \xo 4:12: \xt Gen 38:27-30.\x*
