\mt2 The second summary of the
\mt1 Kings of Israel and Yehudah
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk The second summary of the kings of Israel and Yehudah\bk* is a continuation of the first summary about the northern kingdom of Israel and the Southern kingdom of Yehudah (Judah). This account can be divided into two: \bd 1.\bd* The account about the two kingdoms from around 850 before Yeshua/Jesus (B.C.) through to the defeat of Shomron (Samaria) and the fall of the northern king in 721 before Yeshua/Jesus (B.C.) \bd 2.\bd* The account about the Southern kingdom of Yehudah from the defeat of the northern kingdom of Israel through to the capture and destruction of Yerushalem (Jerusalem) by the Babylonian King Nevukadnetstsar in 586 before Yeshua/Jesus (B.C.) This account ends with Gedalyah governing Yehudah under Babylonian instructions, and then the release of King Yehoyakin who'd been imprisoned in Babylon.
\ip Those disasters and destruction occurred because the leaders and inhabitants of the divided kingdom didn't obey God. The demolition of Yerushalem and the exile of most of the people of Yehudah was a major tragedy in Israel's history.
\ip Prophet Elisha is highlighted here in this second summary. Elisha was the dominant prophet who continued on after Eliyyah's death.

\v 1 After the death¦171792 of \add Israel's¦171790 King\add* Ahab¦171793, Moab¦171789 rebelled¦171788 against Israel.
\p
\v 2 \add One day, King\add* Ahazyah¦171796 fell through¦171797 a lattice¦171798 in his upper¦171799 room in Shomron¦171801 \add (Samaria)\add* and was injured¦171802, \add ≈so\add* he sent¦171803 messengers¦171804 to go¦171807 and ask Ekron's¦171812 God¦171811 Baal-Zevuv if he would recover.
\v 3 \add ≈But\add* Yahweh's messenger told Eliyyah (from Tishbe¦171826), “\add ≈Leave here\add* \add and\add* go¦171828 and meet the Shomron¦171833 king's messengers and \add ≈ask\add* them, ‘Is it because¦171836 there's¦171837 no God in Israel¦171840 that you're all going¦171842 to inquire¦171843 from Ekron's¦171847 God Baal-Zevuv?
\v 4 \add ≈Because of that,\add* Yahweh¦171853 says that \add the king\add* won't¦171859 get out of the bed that he's lying in—he's definitely going to die.”
\p \add ≈So¦171849\add* Eliyyah \add told them and\add* \add ≈continued\add* on his way.
\v 5 \add ≈When\add* the messengers¦171870 returned to \add @the king\add*, he \add ≈asked\add* them, “What's this? \add ≈Why are you¦171877 back here\add* \add so soon\add*?”
\p
\v 6 “A man¦171881 \add ≈came¦171883\add* to meet us,” they told him, “and he said to us, ‘Go \add and\add* return¦171888 to the king¦171891 who sent you, and tell him that Yahweh¦171900 says this: Is it because¦171901 there's no God in Israel¦171905 that you are sending¦171907 \add messengers\add* to inquire¦171908 from Ekron's¦171912 God Baal-Zevuv? Therefore you'll never leave that bed that you're lying in but you'll certainly die \add in it\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 7 “What¦171938 was the man¦171932 \add ≈like\add*,” the king \add ≈asked\add* them, “who met you and \add ≈gave you all that message\add*?”
\p
\v 8 “\add ≈He had a cloak made of animal\add* hair,” they \add ≈answered\add*, “and \add ≈was wearing a leather belt¦171948\add*.”
\p “\add Ah,\add*” said \add @the king\add*. “That's Eliyyah \add ≈from Tishbe¦171954\add*.”
\p
\v 9 \add ≈So¦171957\add* he sent¦171957 a captain with his fifty soldiers to look for \add @Eliyyah\add* and they found him sitting¦171966 on the top of a hill. The captain \add ≈called out\add*, “Man of God¦171974, the king¦171975 \add ≈wants to see you\add*.”
\p
\v 10 \add ≈But¦171979\add* Eliyyah replied, “\add ≈Well,\add* if I am a man of God¦171989, let fire come down from the sky and consume¦171996 you and your \add ≈men\add*,” and fire came down from the sky, and it \add ≈burnt up the captain and his men\add*.
\p
\v 11 \add ≈So¦172012\add* \add @the king\add* sent another¦172018 captain with his fifty men and they went to where Eliyyah was and called out to him, “Prophet, the king commands¦172015 that you come \add ≈with us right now\add*.”
\p
\v 12 \add Again\add* Eliyyah replied, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky and consume¦172046 you and your \add ≈men\add*,” and God's fire came down from the sky, and it \add ≈burnt up the captain and his men\add*.
\p
\v 13 \add ≈So¦172064\add* \add @the king\add* sent¦172065 a third captain with his fifty men. They went¦172072 to where Eliyyah was and the officer knelt down in front of him and \add ≈pleaded\add*, “Prophet, I \add ≈beg\add* you, be kind to me and my fifty soldiers, and don't kill us.
\v 14 Listen, fire¦172102 came down from the sky and burnt up the first¦172112 two¦172109 captains and their¦172115 \add ≈men, but please treat my life¦172118 as valuable in your¦172119 sight¦172119\add*.”
\p
\v 15 Then Yahweh's messenger¦172123 told Eliyyah, “Go with \add #them\add*. Don't be afraid¦172132 of him.”
\p So Eliyyah went with \add #them\add* to the king¦172139
\v 16 and told him, “Yahweh¦172146 says that you sent messengers¦172151 to inquire from Ekron's¦172156 God Baal-Zevuv, \add ≈as if\add* there's no God in Israel¦172161 to \add ≈ask\add*. Therefore, \add he says,\add* \add ≈you certainly won't¦172157 get off that bed that you're on\add* because you'll die \add in it\add*.”
\rem /s1 Death of Ahaziah
\p
\v 17 \add ≈So¦172179\add* \add @King Ahazyah\add* died \add ≈just as Yahweh¦172181 had said via\add* Eliyyah. Then¦172179 \add Ahazyah's younger brother\add* Yehoram \add (Joram)\add* became¦172187 king in his place¦172189, because \add @Ahazyah\add* \add ≈didn't¦172200 have any sons\add*. \add This happened\add* in the second year \add of the reign\add* of Yehoshafat's¦172196 son King Yehoram over Yehudah¦172198.
\v 18 \add ≈Everything else that Ahazyah¦172208 said and did is written¦172214 in the book of the events\add* of the kings¦172220 of Israel¦172221.

\p
\v 1 \add ≈One day as\add* Eliyyah and Elisha¦172234 \add ≈had left\add* Gilgal¦172237, Yahweh¦172226 took Eliyyah up to heaven¦172231 in a storm.
\v 2 Eliyyah had told Elisha¦172243, “Now, you stay here because Yahweh has \add ≈told me to go\add* to Beyt-El.”
\p “By the life of Yahweh,” Elisha \add ≈had responded¦172239\add*, “and by the life of your¦172263 spirit, I won't leave¦172266 you.” \add ≈So¦172239 they'd headed\add* to Beyt-El.
\p
\v 3 \add ≈Also\add* the \add ≈prophets-in-training\add* who were in Beyt-El had gone out to Elisha¦172283 and told him, “Do you know that today Yahweh¦172293 is going to take your¦172295 master¦172293 \add ≈away from you\add*?”
\p “I \add ≈already know that\add*,” he'd \add ≈replied\add*. “\add ≈Don't say anything\add*.”
\p
\v 4 Then¦172303 Eliyyah \add ≈had informed\add* Elisha¦172306, “Yahweh has sent me to Yericho¦172327 \add (Jericho)\add*. You stay here.”
\p He'd \add ≈answered\add*, “By the life of Yahweh and the life of your¦172322 spirit, I won't leave¦172325 you.” \add ≈So¦172303 they'd gone\add* to Yericho.
\p
\v 5 The \add ≈prophets-in-training\add* who were in Yericho¦172335 \add ≈had approached\add* Elisha¦172338 and \add ≈briefed\add* him, “Do you know that today Yahweh¦172348 is taking your¦172350 master¦172348 \add ≈away from you\add*?”
\p “\add ≈Yes, I realise that\add*,” he'd \add ≈responded¦172339\add*. “\add ≈Say no more\add*.”
\p
\v 6 \add ≈Again\add* Eliyyah had told him, “You stay here, because Yahweh has sent me to the Yordan¦172368.”
\p And he'd \add ≈countered\add*, “By the life of Yahweh and the life of your¦172375 spirit, I won't leave¦172378 you.” \add ≈So¦172358 the two of them had gone there together\add*.
\v 7 \add ≈Fifty of the prophets-in-training had also gone, but they'd stood back watching from a distance¦172389, so the two¦172390 of them had stood there\add* by the Yordan¦172394.
\v 8 Then¦172396 Eliyyah had taken off his cloak and \add ≈doubled it over\add* and hit the river \add with it\add*. The water¦172405 divided¦172406 \add ≈leaving a dry path and the two of them had walked across\add* \add to the other¦172408 side\add*.
\v 9 As they'd crossed¦172414 over, Eliyyah had told Elisha¦172419, “\add ≈Tell me what you'd like me to do for you before¦172425 I get taken¦172426 away\add*.”
\p “Please,” Elisha \add ≈had answered\add*, “\add ≈I'd like a\add* double amount of \add ≈the spirit¦172436 that you have\add*.”
\p
\v 10 “\add Oh,\add* \add ≈that's a difficult¦172440 request\add*,” \add @Eliyyah\add* \add ≈had responded¦172439\add*. “\add Well,\add* if you see¦172444 me being taken¦172446 \add ≈away\add* from you, \add ≈then you'll get what you asked¦172441 for, but if you miss seeing me go, you won't¦172454\add*.”
\p
\v 11 Then it had happened \add while\add* they were walking and talking¦172462 \add together\add*. Wow, a chariot¦172464 of fire and horses¦172467 of fire \add drove\add* between¦172470 the two of them, \add ≈separating¦172469 them\add*. Then Eliyyah went up to the heavens¦172475 in the gale.
\v 12 Elisha was watching, and he cried out, “My father, my father, Israel's¦172485 chariot¦172484 and its horsemen¦172486!”
\rem /s1 Elisha Succeeds Elijah
\p \add ≈But¦172477 then\add* \add @Elisha\add* could no longer see him, and he grabbed his \add own\add* \add ≈cloak\add*, and tore \add #it\add* in half,
\v 13 and he picked¦172496 up Eliyyah's¦172500 cloak¦172499 that had fallen¦172502 \add ≈down to the ground\add*. Then¦172496 he went¦172504 back and stood¦172505 on the bank of the Yordan¦172509,
\v 14 and he took¦172511 Eliyyah's cloak¦172514 and \add ≈hit the river\add* \add with it\add*, saying, “Where is Eliyyah's God¦172527 Yahweh¦172526?” \add ≈Then¦172511 as\add* he hit the water, \add ≈the river divided¦172537 into two parts\add* and Elisha¦172541 crossed¦172540 \add ≈through the middle\add*.
\v 15 The \add ≈prophets-in-training\add* who were \add ≈on the Yericho¦172549 side, affirmed\add*, “\add ≈Elisha¦172557 now has the spirit¦172553 that Eliyyah had\add*.” Then¦172543 they came¦172558 \add forward\add* to meet him and \add ≈knelt down in front of him\add* \add as a sign of respect\add*,
\v 16 and they \add ≈requested\add*, “Listen please, \add ≈fifty¦172575 of us here have military training\add*. Please, let them go¦172580 to search for your master¦172585, in case Yahweh's spirit¦172589 lifted him and \add ≈dropped\add* him on \add ≈a hill somewhere\add* or into one of the valleys¦172596.”
\p “\add ≈Don't waste your time\add*,” he \add ≈replied\add*.
\v 17 But¦172602 they \add ≈kept insisting so much that Elisha was embarrassed\add* and he said¦172608, “\add ≈Ok then\add*.”
\p \add ≈So¦172602\add* they sent¦172610 fifty¦172611 men, and they searched for three¦172614 days¦172616, but they didn't¦172617 find \add @Eliyyah\add*.
\v 18 \add ≈When\add* they returned¦172620 to \add @Elisha\add* (he was staying in Yericho¦172624), he said¦172625 to them, “Didn't I \add ≈tell you not to bother\add*?”

\p
\v 19 Then¦172635 the \add ≈leaders\add* of \add Yericho\add* city said to Elisha¦172640, “Please, \add ≈this city is a good place to live\add*, just as my master¦172648 can see, but the water¦172650 \add supplies around here\add* are bad \add ≈so our crops don't thrive\add*.”
\p
\v 20 “Bring me a \add brand\add* new bowl,” he said¦172655, “and put salt there¦172662.” \add ≈So¦172655\add* they¦172664 brought \add ≈one\add* to him,
\v 21 and he went¦172667 out to the \add ≈spring\add* and threw¦172672 the salt at it, and \add ≈announced\add*, “Yahweh¦172680 says¦172679 that he's healed¦172681 these¦172683 water¦172682 \add supplies\add* and \add ≈they'll no longer cause\add* death¦172689 or barrenness.”
\v 22 \add ≈So¦172692 now those water¦172693 supplies have been healthy and beneficial until¦172694 this day¦172695, just as Elisha¦172698 had said\add*.

\p
\v 23 From there¦172704 \add @Elisha\add* went¦172714 to Beyt-El, and as he was going¦172710 up on the road, \add some\add* young¦172713 men came¦172714 out from the city¦172717, and \add ≈started\add* mocking him, saying, “\add ≈Keep moving, baldy. Keep moving, baldy\add*.”
\p
\v 24 Then¦172728 \add @Elisha\add* turned¦172728 \add ≈back around\add* and \add ≈looked at\add* them, and he cursed¦172731 them in Yahweh's name¦172732. \add ≈Just then,\add* two female¦172736 bears¦172736 came¦172734 out from the forest and mauled¦172740 forty-two of \add *them\add*.
\p
\v 25 \add @Elisha\add* carried on from there to Mt. Karmel¦172751, and from there, he returned¦172753 to Shomron¦172754 \add (Samaria)\add*.

\v 1 Ahab's¦172760 son Yehoram \add (Jehoram)\add* became¦172761 king over Israel¦172764 in the eighteenth¦172767 year of King Yehoshafat's¦172769 \add reign over\add* Yehudah¦172771, and he reigned from Shomron¦172765 \add (Samaria)\add* for twelve years.
\v 2 He did \add ≈what Yahweh¦172781 had said\add* was evil, \add ≈but not as bad as\add* his father and mother¦172785 \add had been\add*, and he did remove¦172786 the pillar¦172789 of Baal¦172790 that his father had made.
\v 3 \add ≈However,\add* he \add ≈committed similar sins¦172796 to those\add* of Nebat's¦172800 son Yarave'am¦172797 who had caused¦172803 Israel¦172806 to sin¦172803 and didn't¦172808 \add ≈stop doing\add* them.
\rem /s1 War with Moab
\v 4 \add ≈Now\add* Moab's¦172817 King Mesha¦172814 was a sheep¦172819 breeder, and he would \add ≈pay an annual tribute\add* to Israel's¦172823 king of a hundred thousand young rams, plus the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
\v 5 \add ≈However,\add* after King Ahab¦172835 died, Moab's¦172839 king rebelled¦172836 against Israel's¦172841 \add ≈control over them\add*.
\v 6 \add ≈So¦172843\add* King Yehoram¦172845 set out from Shomron¦172848 and¦172849 mustered¦172849 all \add ≈of Israel's¦172854 fighters\add*.
\v 7 Then¦172856 he sent this message to King Yehoshafat¦172860 of Yehudah¦172863, “Moab's¦172866 king has rebelled¦172867 against me. Will you \add ≈join in battle with me against them\add*?”

\v 8 \add ≈What's our strategy? Which way should we go in\add*?” he \add ≈asked\add*.
\p “\add ≈Through\add* the Edom¦172893 wilderness¦172892,” he \add ≈replied\add*.
\p
\v 9 \add ≈So¦172895\add* the kings of Israel¦172897, Yehudah¦172900, and Edom¦172903 \add took their armies\add* on a seven¦172906 day trip \add circling around\add*, but they \add ≈didn't¦172908 find enough\add* water¦172911 for the men or their animals¦172913,

\v 11 \add ≈But¦172935\add* Yehoshafat¦172936 \add ≈asked\add*, “Isn't there¦172937 one of Yahweh's prophets here, so we might inquire¦172941 from Yahweh through¦172945 him¦172945?”
\p “There's Elisha¦172954,” one of the servants¦172948 of Israel's¦172951 king¦172949 answered¦172946, “Shafat's¦172957 son, \add the prophet\add* who \add ≈was Eliyyah's assistant\add*.”
\p
\v 12 “\add Yes,\add* \add ≈he receives Yahweh's messages\add*,” said¦172967 Yehoshafat¦172968.

\p Then¦173045 while¦173051 the musician played¦173051, Yahweh¦173057 \add ≈spoke to him\add*
\v 16 and he said¦173059, “Yahweh says¦173061 that this valley \add ≈will store lots of water\add*.\f + \fr 3:16 \ft It's not really clear if he's saying that Yahweh will fill natural pools in the valley with water, or if he's instructing the armies to dig trenches or scrape pools that Yahweh will then fill with water.\f*

\v 18 \add ≈That's a piece of cake\add* for Yahweh¦173096. \add ≈What's more, he'll give you¦173101 victory over\add* Moab¦173100.
\v 19 You'll all \add ≈attack¦173103 every¦173104 important city, including their fortified¦173107 ones\add*. You can chop down their fruit trees, block up their springs¦173119, and ruin their good land with stones¦173127.”
\p
\v 20 \add ≈The next day at the time¦173131 of the morning¦173130\add* sacrifice¦173132, \add ≈to their amazement\add* there was water flowing from Edom¦173138 and covering the ground.
\p
\v 21 \add By then\add*, \add ≈the people of\add* Moab¦173147 had heard¦173148 that the kings¦173152 had come¦173151 to battle them, \add ≈so\add* they summoned¦173155 \add ≈everyone¦173157 who could wear a sword and stationed them\add* beside the border¦173163.
\v 22 \add ≈But¦173165\add* when they got up early¦173165 the next morning¦173166 and the sun¦173167 rose, from \add ≈the direction where they were, the water appeared to be\add* red like blood¦173179.

\v 10 Please, \add ≈can we make a small¦173503 upstairs¦173500 room on our flat roof\add*? And we could put a bed and a lampstand in it for him, plus a table¦173508 and chair¦173509. \add ≈Then whenever he's passing through here, he'll have his own spot to stay\add*.”
\p
\v 11 \add ≈Another\add* day¦173518 when Elisha arrived, he went¦173521 up to his room and lay down.
\v 12 Then¦173529 he told his servant¦173533 Gehazi¦173532 to call the Shunammite¦173535 \add woman\add*, \add ≈so\add* he called¦173537 her and she \add came and\add* stood¦173540 in front of \add @Elisha\add*.
\v 13 He told \add @Gehazi\add*, “Now tell her \add ≈that we've noticed how she looks after us, and ask her what we can do for her? Can we\add* speak¦173563 to the king¦173568 for her or to the captain of the army?”

\v 17 Then¦173624 the woman¦173625 became pregnant¦173624 and gave birth¦173626 to a son after the normal time, just as Elisha¦173630 had told her.
\p
\v 18 The child¦173639 grew up and \add ≈one day¦173641\add* he went¦173642 out to his father¦173645 who was with the harvesters,

\p
\v 20 \add ≈So¦173666\add* \add @the servant\add* \add ≈carried¦173666 him back\add* to his mother¦173670, and he sat¦173671 on her¦173674 knees until¦173675 noon when he died¦173678.

\v 22 Then¦173691 she called¦173691 her husband¦173694 and told \add >him\add*, “Please send one of the young men and one of the donkeys¦173704 to me \add ≈so I can run and see\add* the man of God¦173709 and \add ≈then come back\add*.”

\p “\add ≈It'll be okay\add*,” she \add ≈answered\add*,
\v 24 and she saddled¦173728 the donkey¦173729, and told the young man, “\add Now, let's\add* go¦173735! You lead and don't¦173736 \add ≈slacken off for my comfort\add* unless I tell you to.”
\v 25 So¦173748 \add #they\add* \add ≈set off to seek\add* out the man of God¦173753 at Mt. Karmel¦173757.
\p When \add @Elisha\add* saw her \add coming\add* from a distance¦173764, he told Gehazi¦173768, “Look, there's¦173770 the Shunammite¦173771 woman.

\p
\v 28 “Did I ask¦173824 for a son from \add you¦173831\add*, my master¦173827?” she said¦173823. “\add No, but\add* didn't¦173828 I say¦173829, ‘Don't \add ≈mislead me\add*?’ ”
\v 29 Then¦173834 he told Gehazi¦173835, “\add ≈Tuck in your robe\add* and take¦173838 my staff in your hand¦173840, and go¦173841 \add quickly\add*. If you \add ≈meet anyone\add*, \add just keep going and don't stop to\add* bless them, and if someone blesses you, \add don't stop to\add* answer¦173853 them. \add When you get there,\add* lay my staff on the young man's face¦173858.”
\p
\v 30 \add ≈But¦173861\add* the mother¦173862 of the young man said, “By the life of Yahweh¦173866 and the life of your¦173869 spirit, I won't leave¦173872 \add without\add* you.” \add ≈So¦173861\add* he got \add ≈ready\add*, and went \add ≈with\add* her.

\p
\v 32 \add ≈When\add* Elisha¦173903 reached the house¦173904, \add ≈it was a shock to see\add* the young man lying on his bed, dead¦173907.

\v 8 \add In those days,\add* the king¦174828 of Aram¦174829 was fighting¦174831 against Israel¦174832, and he'd instruct his servants, “\add ≈Set up\add* \add #our\add* camp in such and such a place¦174840.”
\v 9 \add ≈However,\add* the man¦174846 of God¦174847 sent¦174845 to Israel's¦174851 king¦174850 \add ≈to warn him\add*, “Beware of passing by such and such a place¦174855, because the Aramean \add army\add* \add ≈will be attacking there¦174859\add*.”

\p
\v 12 “No, my master¦174914 the king,” a servant¦174912 \add ≈answered\add*. “It's the prophet¦174919 Elisha¦174918 in Israel¦174921 who tells¦174922 their king the things that you say \add even\add* in your¦174930 bedroom.”

\v 15 Early \add the next morning\add*, the man¦174963 of God's servant got up, and going outside he was \add ≈shocked to see\add* chariots¦174975 and horses¦174974 and an army surrounding¦174970 the town, \add ≈so he called\add* \add @Elisha\add*, “Oh, my master¦174980! What will we do?”

\v 16 “Don't \add ≈be afraid¦174987\add*,” he said¦174984, “because \add ≈we have many more than that on our side\add*.”

\v 18 \add ≈When the Arameans approached to swoop in\add*, Elisha prayed¦175024 to Yahweh, “Please, strike¦175030 \add ≈those warriors\add* with blinding light.” \add ≈So¦175022\add* \add @Yahweh\add* struck¦175039 them with blinding light \add ≈just as Elisha had requested¦175024\add*,

\p Then¦175044 he led them to Shomron¦175064 \add (Samaria)\add*,
\v 20 and when they'd entered¦175067 \add *the city\add*, Elisha¦175070 said, “Yahweh, open the eyes of these¦175077 people \add ≈so they can\add* see.” \add ≈So¦175066\add* Yahweh opened¦175079 their¦175083 eyes, and then they \add ≈were stunned to see\add* that they were in the middle¦175086 of Shomron.

\v 5 \add ≈So¦175479 as it was getting dark\add*, they went¦175486 to go¦175481 into the camp, \add ≈but as\add* they came¦175486 to the edge of \add *it\add*, \add ≈to their surprise there wasn't a person in sight\add*.
\v 6 \add It turned out that\add* the master¦175498 had caused¦175499 the Aramean \add ≈army\add* to hear the sounds of chariots¦175506 and horses¦175508 and a large¦175511 army, \add ≈so\add* they'd said \add ≈to each other that the king of Israel¦175522 must have hired¦175518 the Hittite¦175526 and Egyptian kings to join together to fight them\add*.
\v 7 \add ≈As a result,\add* they'd taken off and fled in the twilight¦175536. They'd abandoned¦175537 their tents¦175540 and horses¦175543 and donkeys¦175546—leaving the camp just as it¦175550 was, and fled for their lives¦175554.
\p
\v 8 \add ≈So¦175556\add* those \add four\add* \add ≈men with leprosy approached\add* the edge of the camp and went \add ≈into the first\add* tent, and ate¦175568 and drank¦175569.

Then they returned¦175577 and went into another¦175582 tent, and \add ≈stole some stuff\add* from that one, and went and hid that.
\v 9 Then¦175588 they said \add ≈to each other\add*, “\add ≈We shouldn't¦175593 really be doing¦175598 this today\add*.

\v 10 \add ≈So¦175621\add* they went and called¦175622 out to one of the city¦175626 gatekeepers¦175625, and they informed them, “We went to the Aramean camp, but listen, there \add ≈wasn't anyone there, or any voices¦175640\add*.

\v 2 Ahaz¦180833 was twenty¦180831 when he became¦180834 king¦180834 and he \add ≈reigned¦180839\add* from Yerushalem¦180840 for sixteen years, \add ≈but\add* he didn't¦180841 \add ≈follow\add* what his God¦180847 Yahweh¦180846 \add ≈had said was correct behaviour\add* like his ancestor David¦180848 had done.
\v 3 \add Actually\add* he \add ≈followed the behaviour\add* of the kings¦180853 of Israel¦180854, and he even \add ≈sacrificed\add* his son \add ≈as a burnt offering\add* like \add ≈they do in the nations¦180862 that Yahweh hated and\add* which¦180863 Yahweh had driven out \add ≈of the land as the Israelis¦180854 had entered\add*.\x + \xo 16:3: \xt Deu 12:31.\x*

\p
\v 5 Then Aram's¦180888 King Retsin and Israel's¦180895 King Pekah¦180889 (Remalyah's¦180892 son) came¦180884 uphill to \add ≈attack\add* Yerushalem¦180896, and they laid siege against \add King\add* Ahaz¦180901 but they weren't able to conquer¦180904 \add the city\add*.\x + \xo 16:5: \xt Isa 7:1.\x*
\v 6 At that time¦180906, Aram's¦180912 King Retsin recaptured Elat City for Aram, then he drove¦180917 the Yehudans¦180920 out of Elat and Arameans¦180912 \add ≈moved in\add* \add instead\add* and they have lived¦180927 there¦180928 to this day¦180930.
\v 7 \add ≈So\add* Ahaz¦180935 sent¦180934 messengers¦180936 to Assyria's¦180943 King Tiglat¦180939-Pileser, “I'm your servant¦180945 and your son. Come up and rescue¦180949 me from the kings of Aram¦180953 and Israel¦180956 \add ≈who're here attacking\add* me.”
\v 8 Ahaz¦180961 took the gold¦180967 and silver¦180964 from Yahweh's \add ≈temple\add* and from the \add ≈palace\add* treasuries¦180971, and sent it as a gift¦180978 to the Assyrian king.
\v 9 The king of Assyria¦180983 listened¦180980 to him and \add ≈went in and attacked\add* Damascus¦180989, and he captured¦180990 it and exiled \add @its people\add* to Kir¦180992, and he executed \add King\add* Retsin.

\v 10 King Ahaz¦181000 went¦180998 to meet the Assyrian King Tiglat¦181002-Pileser in Damascus¦181007, and he saw¦181008 the altar that was \add *there\add*. \add ≈So¦180998\add* he sent¦181014 \add ≈a drawing and the detailed measurements\add* of the altar to the priest¦181020 Uriyyah.
\v 11 \add ≈So¦181032\add* Uriyyah built¦181032 the altar¦181037 according¦181038 to \add *the plans\add* that King Ahaz had sent¦181041 from Damascus \add ≈and had it finished before King Ahaz returned\add* from Damascus.

\v 13 and made his burnt¦181076 offering and his grain offering, and he poured¦181080 out his drink¦181083 offering, and he sprinkled the blood¦181087 of his peace offerings onto the altar¦181095.
\v 14 He¦181111 got the bronze¦181099 altar that \add ≈had been dedicated to\add* Yahweh¦181102 moved \add ≈back away from the temple¦181106\add* and placed beside the \add newer, bigger\add* altar.\x + \xo 16:14: \xt Exo 27:1-2; 2Ch 4:1.\x*
\v 15 Then¦181120 King Ahaz¦181124 ordered Uriyyah, “\add ≈Use\add* the large altar for the morning¦181138 burnt offerings and the evening¦181142 grain offerings, and for the king's burnt offerings and grain offerings, and for the people's¦181154 burnt offerings and grain offerings and drink¦181157 offerings. \add ≈Use\add* it for sprinkling¦181168 all the blood of the burnt offerings and of the sacrifices¦181166 on. \add ≈But¦181120 I will use\add* the bronze¦181170 altar for seeking \add guidance\add*.”

\p
\v 17 Then¦181186 King Ahaz¦181188 cut the frames¦181191 off the stands¦181192 \add outside the temple\add*, and he removed¦181193 the basins¦181198 off them.

\rem /s1 Samaria Falls to Assyria; Israel Exiled Because of Sin

\v 7 That happened because the \add ≈Israelis¦181388\add* had sinned against their¦181390 God¦181390 Yahweh¦181389 who had rescued them from King Far-oh in Egypt¦181394. They had \add ≡sinned by\add* worshipping other¦181403 gods¦181402
\v 8 and¦181414 \add ≈imitating the customs¦181406 of the people¦181412 groups\add* who Yahweh¦181410 had driven out of the country ahead of them. \add ≈They had also followed their kings¦181414\add* \add in doing evil things\add*.
\v 9 The \add ≈Israelis¦181422\add* had done things¦181423 secretly¦181419 that their God¦181431 Yahweh¦181430 \add ≈had said weren't right¦181427\add*, and they'd built¦181432 \add ≈hilltop shrines everywhere from the largest fortified¦181443 cities to the smallest towns¦181437\add*.
\v 10 They'd \add also\add* erected stone pillars¦181447 \add to honour gods\add* and Asherah poles¦181448 on every high¦181453 hill and under¦181454 every large tree¦181457,\x + \xo 17:10: \xt 1Ki 14:23.\x*
\v 11 and¦181472 they'd burnt¦181460 incense¦181460 there¦181462 on all \add ≈those hilltops\add* \add just\add* like the \add ≈people groups\add* that Yahweh \add ≈had driven off the land ahead of them\add*—doing those evil¦181474 things¦181473 had made Yahweh angry.
\v 12 They'd served¦181480 idols¦181481 even when Yahweh¦181484 had \add ≈forbidden them\add* from doing that.
\p
\v 13 \add ≈So¦181493\add* Yahweh¦181494 had warned¦181493 Israel¦181495 and Yehudah¦181496 by the \add ≈proclamations\add* of all of his prophets who said, “Turn from your evil¦181508 ways¦181507 and \add ≈obey\add* my commands¦181510 and statutes¦181511, \add ≈following\add* all of the \add ≈instructions that I gave\add* your ancestors¦181519 and which I delivered to you¦181522 \add ≈through\add* my servants¦181524, the prophets.”
\v 14 \add ≈However,\add* they hadn't listened¦181528 and had \add ≈hardened their attitudes\add* \add just\add* like their ancestors¦181534 who \add ≈wouldn't put their\add* trust¦181537 in their God¦181539 Yahweh.
\v 15 They rejected¦181541 his statutes¦181544 and the agreement that he \add ≈made\add* with their¦181552 ancestors¦181552, and \add ≈the warning¦181554 that he gave\add* them. They \add ≈chose to worship lifeless objects\add*, and they became¦181562 \add ≈hollow and empty themselves, just like\add* \add the people of\add* the \add ≈surrounding\add* countries¦181564 which Yahweh¦181569 had commanded¦181568 them not to \add ≈imitate\add*.
\v 16 They \add ≈disobeyed the instructions given to them by\add* their¦181582 God¦181582 Yahweh¦181581 \add ≈by molding two¦181586 metal\add* calves¦181588 for themselves and making an Asherah¦181590 pole.

\v 18 \add ≈So¦181619\add* \add that's why\add* Yahweh¦181620 had become very angry¦181619 at \add the northern kingdom of\add* Israel¦181622 and¦181623 \add ≈caused them to be removed¦181623 from the land\add*. Only \add the Southern kingdom of\add* Yehudah¦181630 \add ≈remained\add*,

\v 20 \add ≈So¦181649\add* Yahweh¦181650 rejected¦181649 all the \add ≈Israelis¦181654\add* and he \add ≈caused them to suffer, including being plundered¦181659 by enemy armies, until¦181660 he banished¦181662 them from his presence¦181663\add*.
\p
\v 21 \add ≈Firstly he'd torn the northern kingdom out from the leadership of David's¦181671 descendants\add* and they'd made Nebat's¦181678 son Yarave'am king¦181672. Then Yarave'am had driven them away from following¦181685 Yahweh¦181686, and had \add ≈induced them into serious sin¦181689\add*.
\v 22 \add ≈So¦181692\add* the \add ≈Israelis¦181694 had followed Yarave'am¦181698 into sin\add* and then didn't¦181701 \add ≈turn away from it\add*,

\v 24 Then the Assyrian king sent people¦181746 from Babylon¦181737 and from Kutah and from Avva and from Hamat¦181740 and Sefarvayim, and he settled¦181742 them in the cities of \add ≈the northern kingdom\add* in place¦181745 of the \add ≈Israelis¦181747\add*.

\v 25 \add ≈At¦181765 first¦181756 the new inhabitants living¦181757 there¦181758 didn't¦181759 respect\add* Yahweh¦181763, \add ≈however\add* \add *he\add* sent¦181764 lions¦181769 among them and they \add ≈started\add* killing¦181771 them.
\v 26 They told the Assyrian king¦181775, “The \add ≈people groups\add* that you exiled¦181780 \add from their own countries¦181778\add* and settled in the towns around Shomron¦181783, don't know the customs of the God of the land. \add ≈So¦181774\add* he's sent lions¦181796 against them, and look at them—killing¦181798 them because they don't know the customs of the God of the land.”
\v 27 “\add ≈Send\add* one of the priests¦181817 back that was brought from there,” the Assyrian king¦181810 commanded¦181809. “He can go¦181821 back there and settle there \add again\add*, then he can teach¦181824 them the customs¦181827 of the God¦181828 of that place.”

\v 29 \add ≈But¦181850 each people group\add* had made their¦181864 own gods and¦181855 put them in the \add ≈hilltop shrines\add* that the \add ≈Israelis\add* had made \add before being exiled\add*. \add ≈Each people group did that in the area where¦181865 they'd been resettled\add*.
