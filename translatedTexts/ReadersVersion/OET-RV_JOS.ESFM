\is1 Introduction
\ip This account about Yehoshua, traditionally ‘Joshua’ in English (after ‘I’ and then ‘J’ changed over the centuries from a ‘Y’ sound), tells how the Israelis invaded Canaan and took control of the land. Yehoshua led them forward now after replacing Mosheh (Moses) when he passed away somewhere on a mountain. Some of the main events described in this document include: their crossing the Yordan river, the demolition of Yericho (traditionally ‘Jericho’), the war at Ay, the allocation of blocks of land to the various Israeli tribes and others, and the renewal of the agreement between God and his people.
\ip The most well-known saying in this account is, “…choose for yourselves today who you will serve… But as for me and my household, we will serve Yahweh.” (24:15).

\v 1 After the death¦99059 of Yahweh's servant Mosheh \add (Moses¦99060)\add*, Yahweh spoke to Mosheh's servant Yehoshua \add (Joshua)\add* (the son of Nun¦99070), saying,
\v 2 “Now that my servant¦99076 Mosheh¦99075 is dead, you¦99085 and all \add #these\add* people¦99088 \add ≈should pack up\add* \add and\add* cross over this \add River\add* Yordan¦99083 \add to go\add* to the land that I am about¦99095 to give¦99095 to them—to Yisra'el's descendants.
\v 3 I'll give you¦99109 all every place¦99102 that the \add #soles\add* of your¦99107 \add #feet\add* tread¦99104 on, just like I told Mosheh¦99115.\x + \xo 1:3-5: \xt Deu 11:24-25.\x*
\v 4 Your \add ≈territory¦99137 will extend\add* from the wilderness¦99117 \add in the south\add* to the Lebanon¦99118 \add mountains in the north\add*, and from the large Euphrates¦99126 River \add in the east\add*, and \add ≈right to the Mediterranean\add* sea¦99132 \add ≈in the west\add*, including all of the Hittites' land.
\v 5 No man will \add ≈be able to challenge your leadership as long as you live\add*—I'll be with you just as I was with Mosheh¦99151—I won't¦99154 fail you or abandon¦99157 you.\x + \xo 1:5: \xt Deu 31:6,8; Heb 13:5.\x*
\v 6 Be strong¦99159 and be courageous¦99160, for you yourself will \add ≈lead\add* \add #these\add* people¦99166 to inherit¦99163 the land that I promised their¦99174 ancestors¦99174 that I'd give¦99175 to them.\x + \xo 1:6: \xt Deu 31:6-7,23.\x*
\v 7 Just be strong¦99179 and very courageous¦99180—making sure that you \add ≈obey everything\add* that my servant¦99190 Mosheh¦99189 instructed¦99188 you. Don't turn away to the right¦99195 or to the left from it, so that you'll be wise in every \add ≈situation that you end up in\add*.
\v 8 That¦99225 book of the law \add ^must always be on your lips\add* and you should meditate¦99210 on it day¦99212 and night¦99213, so that you'll be careful to follow everything that's written¦99219 in it, because then you'll make your ways prosperous and then you'll be wise.
\v 9 Didn't I order you to be strong¦99233 and courageous¦99234? Don't tremble or be discouraged because your God¦99244 Yahweh¦99243 will be with you wherever¦99246 you go¦99247.”

\p
\v 10 Then Yehoshua instructed¦99250 the leaders of the people¦99255,
\v 11 “Go right through the camp and tell the people¦99265: Get everything ready that you'll all need because in three¦99273 days¦99274 we'll be ready to cross over this river and enter the land that your God¦99288 Yahweh¦99287 is about to give¦99289 to you, and to take¦99282 control of it¦99291.”
\p
\v 12 To the descendants of Reuben and Gad, and to the half-tribe of Menashsheh¦99298, Yehoshua said¦99299,\x + \xo 1:12-15: \xt Num 32:28-32; Deu 3:18-20; Josh 22:1-6.\x*
\v 13 “Remember¦99303 what Yahweh's servant¦99311 Mosheh¦99310 informed you: Your God¦99316 Yahweh is about give this land to you and to \add ≈enable you all to settle down\add*.
\v 14 Your women and children and your livestock¦99328 will stay \add here\add* in the land that Mosheh¦99334 \add ≈allocated\add* to you on \add ≈this eastern\add* side of the Yordan¦99336 River. But your \add soldiers\add* must dress for battle¦99339 and cross over ahead of your brothers¦99341 and help¦99345 them
\v 15 until Yahweh enables your brothers¦99354 to \add ≈take over the land that your God¦99366 Yahweh is about¦99367 to give them so they can settle like you all have\add*. Then you'll all be able to return¦99369 to this land which Yahweh's servant¦99379 Mosheh¦99378 gave¦99376 you on \add ≈this eastern side of the Yordan¦99382 and take full control of it\add*.”
\p
\v 16 “We'll¦99389 do everything¦99398 you've told us to,” the people answered¦99386, “and¦99396 we'll go¦99402 wherever¦99400 you send¦99401 us.
\v 17 We'll listen¦99412 to you just like we listened¦99407 to everything¦99404 Mosheh said. May your God¦99417 Yahweh¦99416 be with you, just like he was with Mosheh.
\v 18 We'll put anyone to death¦99444 who rebels¦99430 against¦99430 your words¦99439 or refuses to follow your instructions. Just stay strong¦99446 and courageous¦99447.”

\s1 Spies sent to Yericho

\p
\v 1 Then from \add there at\add* \add ≈Acacia Grove\add*, Yehoshua (Nun's¦99455 son) secretly¦99463 sent¦99450 off two¦99459 spies¦99462, saying, “Go \add ≈and learn about the land over there, especially around\add* Yericho¦99472 \add City\add*.” \add ≈So\add* they went¦99473 off, and \add over there,\add* they entered the house¦99475 of a woman¦99477—a prostitute¦99478 named Rahab¦99480—and they lay down there.\x + \xo 2:1: \xt Heb 11:31; Jam 2:25.\x*
\v 2 \add ≈However, someone told\add* Yericho's¦99487 king¦99486, “Listen, some Israeli men¦99490 arrived here tonight to \add ≈check out our\add* land.”
\v 3 So¦99501 the king¦99502 sent¦99501 \add guards\add* to tell Rahab¦99506, “Bring¦99503 out the men¦99509 who \add ≈went¦99510 to your¦99515 place\add* and \add ≈stayed the night\add*, because they've come¦99523 here to \add ≈check out\add* our land!”
\p
\v 4 \add ≈However, Rahab had hidden¦99531\add* the two men \add ≈so she answered\add*, “Indeed, the men \add ≈arrived here, but\add* I didn't¦99538 know where¦99540 they were from.
\v 5 \add ≈But¦99543 as\add* the \add city\add* gate was \add ≈about\add* to shut \add ≈last night\add*, the men went out. I¦99550 don't¦99549 know to where¦99551 \add *they\add* went—if you all hurry, you might be able to \add ≈catch\add* them.”
\v 6 (\add ≈But¦99560 actually\add* she had taken them up onto her \add flat\add* roof and hidden¦99563 them in \add ≈bundles of flax that were drying there\add*.)
\v 7 \add ≈So¦99576\add* the \add ≈guards hurried\add* out on the road¦99575 to the fords¦99578 on the Yordan¦99576 \add River\add* and¦99579 the \add city\add* gate was kept shut after \add *they\add* had left.
\p
\v 8 Before the Israeli men lay down \add to sleep that night\add*, \add @Rahab\add* went¦99591 up them on the roof¦99595
\v 9 and told \add *them\add*, “\add #We\add* know¦99601 that Yahweh¦99605 has given¦99604 this land to you all and we're \add ≈all terrified\add* of you. Everyone¦99601 that lives here is \add ≈trembling at the thought of your¦99613 coming\add*
\v 10 because we've heard that Yahweh¦99629 dried¦99628 up the water¦99632 of the Red Sea ahead of you all when you left¦99637 Egypt¦99638 \add (Mitsrayim¦99638)\add*. And \add ≡we heard\add* what you all did to two of the Amorite¦99643 kings¦99642 Sihon¦99647 and Og¦99648 over the Yordan¦99646 there—how you all completely destroyed¦99650 them.\x + \xo 2:10: a \xt Exo 14:21; \xo b \xt Num 21:21-35.\x*
\v 11 \add ≈Yes,\add* we've heard¦99653 \add <the reports\add* and \add ≈we trembled and lost our courage to fight you¦99662 all\add* because¦99662 your¦99665 God Yahweh¦99664, he's God \add ≈over\add* the heavens¦99668 above¦99669 and the earth¦99672 below¦99673.
\v 12 \add ≈So¦99675\add* now, please¦99678 promise me by Yahweh that because I've been kind to \add both of\add* you, you all will act kindly towards my father's¦99693 household¦99692. Give me \add ≈a guarantee that you'll do what you promise\add*
\v 13 and spare¦99700 my parents and my siblings and their families from death¦99723.”
\p
\v 14 “Our lives \add ≈for your lives\add*,” the \add two\add* men¦99727 agreed. “If you don't¦99732 tell \add ≈anyone about our agreement\add*, then when Yahweh¦99741 gives¦99739 us this land, we'll \add ≈show\add* kindness and faithfulness¦99749 to you.”
\p
\v 15 Then¦99751 she put a rope¦99752 out through¦99753 the window¦99754 to let them down \add to escape from the city\add*, because her¦99756 house¦99756 where she lived was \add actually built into\add* the side of the wall.
\v 16 “Go to the hill country¦99765,” she told them, “\add ≈so those searching for you won't find\add* you, and hide \add up\add* there¦99773 for three¦99774 days¦99775. \add Then¦99763 once\add* the searchers have returned, you'll be able to \add safely\add* \add ≈return to your camp\add*.”
\p
\v 17 “\add ≈This promise that you made us make\add*,” the men¦99785 told her, “\add ≈won't apply unless you do this\add*:
\v 18 \add Take\add* this red cord \add and\add* when we¦99794 \add ≈invade\add* the land, tie \add *it\add* in this window¦99804 \add ≈in the wall\add*. Make sure that your parents and your siblings and their households are all here in your house¦99824.
\v 19 If any of them leaves the house, \add ≈their life will then be in their own hands\add* and we'll be innocent \add if they're killed\add*. But¦99826 if anyone with you in this house \add ≈gets injured\add*, \add ≈we'll be responsible for that\add*.
\v 20 \add ≈Also¦99856,\add* if you tell anyone else about this agreement, then we'll be \add ≈released\add* from this promise that you made us make.”
\v 21 “\add ≈Sure¦99874, let it be as you say\add*,” \add @Rahab\add* \add ≈responded¦99866\add*. Then¦99866 she sent¦99871 them off, and after they'd gone, she tied the red cord in her window¦99878.
\p
\v 22 \add @The two men\add* went¦99881 up into the hills and stayed there¦99884 for three¦99885 days¦99886 until¦99887 the search party returned¦99889 \add to the city\add* after searching all the roads and not finding them.
\v 23 \add ≈So¦99899\add* the two¦99900 men¦99901 went¦99902 down to the river and crossed¦99904 over and returned¦99899 to Yehoshua¦99908 (Nun's¦99911 son), and they¦99905 told him everything that had happened¦99918.
\v 24 “Yahweh¦99928 has certainly given¦99927 this land to us,” they told Yehoshua. “The people there won't be able to resist us because¦99942 they're so terrified.”

\p
\v 1 Early the next morning¦99947, Yehoshua \add and the people¦99957\add* got up early¦99945 and set off from Acacia Grove and went¦99950 as far as the Yordan¦99953 \add River\add* and camped¦99959 there¦99960 without crossing over.
\v 2 After three¦99966 days¦99967, the leaders went¦99968 throughout the camp
\v 3 and instructed¦99973 the people¦99976, “As soon as you all see the box¦99980 \add containing\add* the agreement with your God¦99984 Yahweh¦99983, and \add ≡see\add* the Levitical¦99986 priests¦99985 carrying¦99987 it, then you yourselves should move out from your places¦99991 and follow after¦99993 it.
\v 4 But keep about¦100002 nine hundred metres back from it. Don't go any closer than that so that you all can see the way to go, because \add ≈we haven't been this way\add* before.”
\p
\v 5 Then Yehoshua told the people¦100032, “\add ≈Make sure you¦100038 all do the ritual washing to make yourselves¦100033 pure\add*, because tomorrow¦100035 Yahweh¦100037 will do miracles among us.”
\v 6 And \add *he\add* told the priests¦100045, “Lift up the box¦100050 with the agreement, and \add ≈walk across here in front\add* of the people.” \add ≈So¦100041\add* they lifted up the \add sacred\add* chest¦100050 and went \add ≈and stood in front of all\add* the people.
\p
\v 7 Then Yahweh¦100066 told Yehoshua, “Today I'll begin¦100072 to make you powerful in the eyes¦100074 of all Yisrael¦100077 \add (Israel¦100077)\add* so they'll know¦100079 that I'm with you just like I was with Mosheh¦100085.
\v 8 Tell the priests¦100093 who are carrying¦100094 the \add sacred\add* chest¦100095 that as soon as they come¦100099 to the edge of the river, they should \add ≈go in just a little and then stop there\add*.”
\p
\v 9 Then Yehoshua told the Israelis¦100114, “\add ≈Gather around\add* here and listen¦100117 to your¦100122 God¦100122 Yahweh's¦100121 message.”
\v 10 \add *He\add* told \add <them\add*, “This is how you'll all know¦100127 that God¦100129, who can do anything, is among you. With your¦100131 own eyes, you'll all see how he'll take away the land from the Canaanites¦100137, the Hittites¦100140, the Hivites, the Perizzites¦100146, the Girgashites¦100149, the Amorites¦100150, and the Yebusites.
\v 11 Listen, the sacred chest¦100154 containing the slabs that belongs to the master¦100156 who \add owns\add* the whole world, is about¦100160 to \add be taken\add* across the Yordan¦100162 in front of you¦100161.
\v 12 \add ≈So¦100171\add* now, \add ≈select one man from each of your twelve tribes¦100170\add*,
\v 13 and as soon as the \add ≈priests¦100184 carrying¦100185 the sacred chest¦100186 go into the Yordan¦100193, as soon as their feet¦100183 touch the water, the river water on the upstream side\add* will pile up in a heap.”
\p
\v 14 \add ≈So¦100204 once the people had packed up their¦100207 tents¦100207 ready to cross¦100208 the river\add*, the priests¦100212 carrying¦100213 the sacred box¦100214 walked ahead in front¦100216 of them.
\v 15 Then¦100219 as soon as \add ≈those¦100220 priests¦100226\add* steeped into the \add edge\add* of the \add ≈fast-flowing\add* river (because it¦100233 overflowed its¦100238 banks¦100238 at harvest¦100241 time \add in the spring\add*),
\v 16 then the water coming from upstream \add suddenly\add* stopped flowing. The water far upstream piled up near a town called Adam¦100253 (near Tsaretan), and the water that normally flowed down towards the Sea of Arabah (\add also called\add* the Dead Sea or the Salt Sea) \add ≈stopped flowing\add*, so the people¦100268 were able to cross \add what was\add* the Yordan River opposite Yericho¦100271.
\v 17 The priests¦100274 carrying¦100275 the sacred chest¦100276 with Yahweh's¦100279 agreement \add in it\add*, stood¦100273 on firm, dry ground in \add what had been\add* the middle¦100281 of the river. All the Israelis crossed¦100296 over on dry ground until¦100289 everyone was across.

\p
\v 1 Once all the people had crossed¦100308 over the Yordan¦100311 River, Yahweh¦100314 told Yehoshua,
\v 2 “Take \add those\add* twelve men¦100327 \add ≈that the people¦100324 selected from each tribe¦100334\add*,
\v 3 and give them these instructions: Pick up twelve boulders¦100352 from here in the middle¦100343 of the Yordan¦100344 from near where the priests¦100347 are standing, and bring them over with you, and put them in the place where you all camp tonight.”
\p
\v 4 \add ≈So\add* Yehoshua called¦100366 \add over\add* the twelve men, one from each tribe¦100383,
\v 5 and told them, “Cross \add ≈back to where\add* your God¦100392 Yahweh's¦100391 box¦100390 is in the middle¦100395 of the Yordan¦100396 and \add ≈each of you¦100398 should pick up a rock¦100400 and carry it back on your\add* shoulder—one stone¦100400 each on your shoulder to match the number¦100405 of tribes¦100406 of Yisra'el's sons.
\v 6 \add ≈Those boulders will be a monument for all the people\add*. \add ≈In the future when your¦100419 children¦100419 ask¦100418 what those boulders mean\add*,
\v 7 then you'll all be able to tell them that the water in the Yordan¦100432 River was cut off ahead of the box¦100434 with Yahweh's¦100437 agreement. When it¦100438 crossed¦100438 over into the river, the water in the river \add ≈stopped flowing\add*, and¦100443 those boulders¦100444 are a memorial¦100446 for the Israelis¦100448 forever.
\p
\v 8 \add ≈So¦100453\add* the Israelis¦100458 did just what Yehoshua had told them to do, and they picked up twelve boulders¦100467 from the Yordan¦100469, just as Yahweh¦100472 had instructed¦100461 Yehoshua, and brought them over to where \add the people\add* were camping and placed them down there¦100487.
\v 9 Then¦100489 Yehoshua¦100493 stacked up twelve other boulders¦100491 in the middle¦100494 of the Yordan¦100495 where the feet¦100498 of the priests¦100499 carrying¦100500 the box¦100501 with the agreement had been, and¦100503 they¦100503 remain there¦100504 until¦100505 today.
\v 10 The priests¦100509 carrying¦100510 the box¦100511 had stood in the middle¦100513 of the Yordan¦100514 until¦100515 everything¦100517 that Yahweh¦100523 had instructed Yehoshua to pass on to the people was done, just as Mosheh¦100535 had \add also\add* instructed Yehoshua, and the people had rapidly crossed¦100541 over.
\p
\v 11 As soon as all the people had crossed over, the priests¦100555 carrying Yahweh's¦100554 box¦100552 \add also\add* crossed over in front¦100556 of the people.
\v 12 The \add soldiers\add* from the tribes¦100567 of Reuben¦100562, and Gad¦100565 and the half-tribe of Menashsheh¦100568 had \add ≈marched\add* over ahead of the rest of the Israeli, as Mosheh¦100576 had \add ≈agreed with them\add*.
\v 13 (\add There¦100584 were\add* around forty¦100578 thousand¦100579 of them, armed and ready for battle, and they¦100582 were heading to the plains¦100587 of Yericho¦100588 for the battle \add there\add*.)
\v 14 On that day¦100591, Yahweh¦100594 helped Yehoshua to look powerful in the eyes¦100598 of the people, and they respected him just as they had respected Mosheh all the days¦100611 of his\f + \fr 4:14 \ft The Hebrew doesn't make it clear here whether the writer meant all of \bd Mosheh's life\bd* or all of \bd Yehoshua's life\bd*, so translations will vary.\f* life.
\p
\v 15 Then Yahweh¦100616 told Yehoshua,
\v 16 “\add ≈Now order\add* the priests¦100625 carrying¦100626 the box¦100627 with the agreement to come¦100629 up out of \add what was\add* the Yordan¦100632 \add River\add*,”
\v 17 so Yehoshua¦100635 instructed¦100634 the priests¦100638 to come¦100640 on up from the Yordan¦100643.
\v 18 As soon as the priests¦100648 carrying¦100649 the box¦100650 with Yahweh's¦100653 agreement came¦100646 up out of \add what had been\add* the Yordan¦100655 \add River\add* and their¦100666 feet¦100658 stepped onto \add what had been\add* dry land, the river water¦100663 returned¦100662 to its place¦100666 and overflowed it banks¦100675 as \add ≈it had been doing for the previous few days¦100670\add*.
\p

\p
\v 6 \add ≈So¦101236\add* Yehoshua summoned the priests and told them, “Carry the box with the agreement, and have seven priests hold up seven rams' horns¦101256 \add ≈ahead\add* of Yahweh's¦101259 box.”

\p
\v 11 \add ≈So¦101341\add* Yahweh's¦101344 box¦101342 was carried once around¦101341 the city¦101347, then the people went¦101341 back to the camp and stayed the night¦101353 there.

\v 9 \add ≈So¦102490\add* Yehoshua sent¦102490 them to \add set up\add* the ambush¦102495 between Ay and Beyt-El (so west of Ay). \add ≈Meanwhile,\add* \add *he\add* stayed overnight \add ≈at the camp\add*.
\p
\v 10 Yehoshua got up early¦102512 in the morning¦102514 and gathered the \add ≈warriors\add*, then he and the Israeli elders¦102521 went \add ≈in front¦102523 of them\add* \add to go and attack\add* Ay.
\v 11 \add *They all\add* went¦102533 close to the city¦102537 and camped¦102538 \add there slightly\add* to the north¦102539, with just a valley between¦102544 them and Ay¦102540.
\v 12 (He had sent around five¦102549 thousand¦102550 warriors to \add ≈lie in\add* ambush¦102554 between Beyt-El and Ay, west of the city¦102562,
\v 13 \add ≈so\add* the main group was to the north¦102572 and the rear guard¦102576 to the west.) That night¦102581 Yehoshua went¦102579 down into the valley¦102584.
\v 14 When the king of Ay saw \add <the Israelis\add*, he hurriedly¦102591 got his men ready, and went out early¦102592 to meet Yisrael¦102599 for the battle¦102600. The king and his people¦102604 went to a \add ≈prepared spot overlooking the Yordan valley, but\add* he didn't¦102609 know that \add ≈another group lay in ambush¦102613 behind¦102615 the city\add*.
\v 15 Yehoshua and the Israeli group allowed themselves to be struck by them, then they fled back towards the wilderness¦102626
\v 16 and all the \add ≈men\add* in the city were called¦102628 out to chase them. \add ≈So¦102628\add* they chased after Yehoshua¦102639 and were drawn¦102640 away from the city,
\v 17 and there wasn't a single man left in Ay or Beyt-El who didn't¦102645 \add ≈join the chase\add*—they¦102655 left the city¦102661 \add wide\add* open and chased after the Israelis.
\p
\v 18 Then Yahweh¦102669 told Yehoshua, “Hold your spear out \add ≈pointing\add* towards Ay, because I will \add ≈allow you to defeat it\add*.” \add ≈So\add* Yehoshua held the spear that was in his hand out toward the city¦102692.
\v 19 \add ≈When¦102706 the warriors in the ambush¦102694 saw that, they\add* rushed out from their¦102697 place¦102697 and entered the city and captured¦102703 it, and quickly set \add *it\add* on fire.
\v 20 \add When\add* the men from Ay turned and looked¦102711 behind them, the smoke¦102718 from their city¦102719 was going up into the sky, \add ≈but they had nowhere to escape to.\add* Then¦102711 \add @Yehoshua's men\add* who'd been fleeing¦102730 towards the wilderness¦102731 turned back around towards their pursuers¦102735
\v 21 and saw that the ambush¦102745 had captured¦102744 the city and the smoke¦102751 was rising. \add ≈So¦102737\add* they \add ≈continued back towards Ay¦102740, killing their men\add*.
\v 22 \add ≈Meanwhile,\add* \add @their warriors\add* came¦102761 \add back\add* out of the city¦102764, \add ≈so\add* the men from Ay ended up in the middle of the two groups, and \add @the Israelis\add* \add ≈fought until¦102775 they'd killed them all\add*.
\v 23 \add ≈However\add* they¦102788 captured¦102788 the king¦102786 of Ay alive¦102789 and¦102790 brought¦102790 him to Yehoshua.
\p
\v 24 Then¦102796 \add ≈after the Israelis¦102820\add* had finished¦102797 killing¦102799 the \add ≈men of\add* Ay who had chased them \add towards\add* the wilderness¦102807, \add *they\add* returned¦102819 to Ay and \add ≈slaughtered the people still in there\add*,
\v 25 \add ≈so a total of\add* twelve thousand¦102842 men and women from Ay¦102845 \add ≈were killed\add* that day¦102834.
\v 26 Yehoshua didn't¦102848 \add ≈lower his\add* spear until¦102855 everyone who lived in Ay had been completely destroyed¦102857.
\v 27 \add ≈The Israelis\add* only took the livestock and¦102866 the goods from \add ≈Ay\add*, just as Yahweh¦102873 had instructed¦102875 Yehoshua,
\v 28 then Yehoshua¦102881 burnt the city and¦102885 made it¦102885 a \add ≈permanent pile of rubble where no one lives to this day¦102891\add*.
\v 29 \add *He\add* hanged¦102898 the king¦102896 of Ay on a tree, \add ≈but\add* as the sun¦102907 was going down, \add *he\add* commanded¦102908 that the corpse be brought down from the tree.

\v 6 They went¦103165 to Yehoshua in the camp at Gilgal¦103172 and told him, “We've come¦103181 from a far-off land and \add ≈want you to make a treaty with\add* us.”

\v 9 “Your servants¦103227 have come¦103226 from a very distant¦103224 land,” they replied, “because¦103228 of the reputation of your God¦103230, Yahweh¦103229. We've heard¦103233 the \add #reports\add* about him¦103234 and everything that he¦103239 did in Egypt¦103240,

\p
\v 24 “Because it was \add ≈made very clear\add* to your servants¦103501,” they answered¦103493, “that your God¦103506 Yahweh¦103505 had commanded¦103504 his servant¦103510 Mosheh¦103509 to give¦103511 to you all the land and to destroy¦103518 everyone who lives in the region. \add ≈We feared¦103526 for our lives when you came closer\add*, so that's what we did.

\v 1 The allotment for Manashsheh's¦107121 descendants (Yosef's¦107126 eldest son) \add included a special allotment for\add* (Gilead's¦107131 father¦107130) Makir—he was given Gilead and Bashan¦107141 because he was a \add ≈powerful warrior\add*.
\v 2 The other Manashsheh clans \add that were allocated land\add* were the Abiezer¦107149, Helek¦107152, Asriel¦107154, Shekem¦107157, Hefer¦107160, and Shemida¦107162 clans. (They were the sons of Yosef's son Manashsheh \add who led their own\add* clans.)
\v 3 \add ≈But¦107172\add* Zelofehad (son of Hefer¦107175, son of Gilead¦107178, son of Makir¦107181, son of Manashsheh¦107184) had no sons—only daughters who were named Mahlah¦107197, Noah¦107198, Hoglah¦107199, Milkah, and Tirzah¦107201.
\v 4 They approached the priest¦107206 Eleazar and Yehoshua and the other leaders¦107214 and said, “Yahweh told Mosheh¦107220 to give us an inheritance along with our brothers.” \add ≈So¦107203\add* he\f + \fr 17:4 \ft It's not clear who this ‘he’ refers to here—some translations choose Eleazar (implied by the sentence structure) and others choose Yehoshua (implied by past allocations of land).\f* gave them an inheritance (like he'd given their¦107236 uncles), as Yahweh \add ≈had instructed¦107217 them\add*.\x + \xo 17:4: \xt Num 27:1-7.\x*

\v 7 The border¦107267 for Manashsheh¦107269 went from Asher¦107270 to Mikmetat \add ≈opposite\add* Shekem¦107276, then went \add ≈south¦107281\add* towards the spring at Tappuah.
\v 8 (The Tappuah \em land\em* was for Manashsheh¦107296, but Tappuah \add town\add* was for Efrayim¦107298.)
\v 9 Then¦107300 the border went south¦107304 to the Kanah¦107303 riverbed—the cities there belonged to Efrayim¦107308 even though they were inside Manashsheh's¦107311 land—then the border stayed on the north¦107314 side of the riverbed and extended to the \add ≈Mediterranean¦107313\add*.
\v 10 \add So\add* the south was for Efrayim¦107321 and the north was for Manashsheh¦107323, and the sea¦107325 was the \add western\add* border¦107326, meeting Asher¦107327 from the north and Yissashkar from the east.
\v 11 Manashsheh¦107334 was allocated cities inside \add both\add* Yissashkar's and Asher's¦107336 territories: Beyt-Shan, Ibleam¦107341, Dor¦107346, Endor¦107351, Taanach¦107354, and Megiddo¦107357 along with their \add ≈surrounding towns\add*.\f + \fr 17:11 \ft We've omitted the final Hebrew phrase here (the three of Nafet) since it's unclear what it means (plus it's not considered to be a vital point in the narrative).\f*

\v 14 Then the \add two\add* \add ≈half-tribes of Efrayim and Manashsheh\add* asked Yehoshua, “Why have you¦107400 \add only\add* given¦107400 to \add #us\add* one measured allocation as an inheritance¦107402 when \add #we're\add* \add very\add* numerous¦107410 \add because\add* Yahweh¦107418 has \add ≈already\add* blessed¦107417 \add #us\add*?”

\v 16 “The hill country¦107453 \add certainly\add* isn't¦107449 big enough for \add all of\add* us,” \add *they\add* responded¦107446, “plus the Canaanites¦107458 living in the Yezreel¦107470 valley and in Beyt-Shan and the surrounding towns have iron chariots¦107454.”
\p
\v 17 \add ≈So¦107472\add* Yehoshua told the \add ≈half-tribes of Efrayim¦107478 and Manashsheh¦107479\add*, “\add Yes\add*, there's a lot of you and you're very powerful¦107485. One land allotment \add ≈wouldn't be enough for you\add*

\v 6 You all should write descriptions¦107612 of the seven parts and bring¦107618 them here to me, and in front¦107625 of our God¦107627 Yahweh¦107626, I'll throw¦107621 dice for you \add to allocate them to the seven tribes\add*.
\v 7 However, the Levites¦107633 don't¦107630 receive a portion¦107632, because their inheritance is Yahweh's priesthood¦107637.

\v 24 \add ≈But¦110220 no, we did it because¦110224 we foresaw a potential problem: what if in the future, your descendants ask our descendants\add* \add over here on this side of the river\add*, ‘What \add ≈do you¦110237 lot have to do with\add* Yisrael's¦110240 God¦110239 Yahweh?

\v 1 \add ≈A long time passed\add* and Yahweh¦110522 had given¦110521 Yisrael¦110523 \add ≈peace without attacks\add* from their¦110526 enemies¦110526 all around, and Yehoshua was \add now\add* \add ≈in his old age\add*,
\v 2 \add ≈so\add* he summoned all the Israeli elders¦110538 and leaders, along with the judges¦110540 and officials¦110541. He told them, “Now I'm in my old age,
\v 3 \add ≈but\add* you all have seen¦110550 what Yahweh¦110556 did to all those \add ≈kingdoms\add* ahead of you, because \add *he's\add* the one who fights¦110567 for you all.
\v 4 I've allocated the remaining¦110576 \add ≈kingdoms\add* that you¦110572 all will defeat as an inheritance¦110578 for your¦110579 tribes¦110579, alongside those that I conquered from the Yordan¦110582 to the Mediterranean in the west
\v 5 Your¦110597 God¦110594 Yahweh¦110607 will push them out ahead of you all and capture their¦110604 lands for you to possess¦110601, just as \add *he\add* told you he would.
\v 6 Take¦110615 great care to obey and do everything¦110616 that Mosheh¦110621 wrote¦110618 down—don't¦110622 deviate from it in any way.
\v 7 Don't enter those remaining¦110634 \add ≈kingdoms\add*, and don't mention the name of their gods¦110638 or make an oath using their names¦110637 and don't worship or bow down to them.
\v 8 Instead you all should cling¦110655 to your God¦110654 Yahweh, just as you've done until¦110658 now.
\v 9 \add Yes,\add* Yahweh¦110663 has driven¦110662 away many great¦110666 kingdoms ahead of you all, and until¦110674 this day¦110675, none of them have stood against you.
\v 10 Just one of you \add ≈can make a thousand¦110684 men flee\add*, because Yahweh¦110687 is your¦110681 God¦110688—he's the one who fights¦110690 for you just \add ≈like he said he would\add*.\x + \xo 23:10: a \xt Deu 32:30; \xo b \xt Deu 3:22.\x*
\v 11 \add ≈Make¦110700 a great effort to guard yourselves\add* that you all \add continue\add* to love¦110699 your God¦110703 Yahweh¦110702.
\v 12 \add Yes,\add* if you all ever turn away \add from him\add* and instead cling to those remaining kingdoms or remaining people, and if you intermarry¦110718 with them or associate¦110720 with them,
\v 13 you all will certainly \add soon\add* find out that your God Yahweh will not continue to drive¦110732 out these¦110736 nations¦110735 \add ≈ahead of you\add*. Then they will \add end up\add* trapping and snaring you all, and be like a whip on your sides¦110743 and like thorns¦110744 in your eyes¦110745, until¦110746 you all perish¦110748 from on this good¦110751 land that Yahweh your God has given¦110754 you.
\p
\v 14 Listen, today I'm about to go the way¦110763 \add ≈that everyone¦110779 has to go\add* and you all know with all your heart¦110770 and with all your soul that not one thing has \add ≈failed to come true\add* from all the good things¦110782 that your God¦110787 Yahweh¦110786 said about you. \add ≈Everything has happened as said—down to the very last word\add*.
\v 15 And \add ≈just like all those good things came true\add*, so \add too\add* Yahweh¦110810 will \add ≈send all the punishments he promised you all\add* \add if you disobey him\add*, \add ≈even if it means that\add* he destroys¦110824 you all from this good land that \add *he's\add* given¦110831 you.
\v 16 If¦110854 you ignore the agreement with your God¦110841 Yahweh¦110840 and \add disobey\add* his commands¦110843 and go¦110845 and serve¦110846 other¦110848 gods¦110847 and bow down to them, then \add *his\add* \add ≈anger¦110852 will flare up\add* against you all and you'll quickly¦110857 \add ≈be wiped out\add* from the good¦110860 land that he has given¦110862 you.”

\p
\v 1 Then Yehoshua assembled all the tribes¦110872 of Yisrael¦110873 at Shekem¦110874. He summoned their elders¦110876, leaders, judges¦110879, and officers¦110880, and they presented¦110881 themselves before God¦110883,
\v 2 and Yehoshua told all the people¦110891, “Yahweh¦110895, the God¦110896 of Yisrael¦110897 says: Your ancestors¦110901 \add including\add* Terah¦110903 the father of Abraham¦110905 and Nahor¦110907, lived beyond¦110898 the \add Euphrates\add* river¦110899 from long ago, \add ≈but\add* they \add ≈worshipped\add* other¦110910 gods.\x + \xo 24:2: \xt Gen 11:27.\x*
\v 3 Then¦110912 I took¦110912 your ancestor Abraham¦110918 from beyond¦110919 the river¦110920 and brought him \add ≈across\add* all the land of Canaan¦110926, and I multiplied¦110927 his \add ≈descendants\add*, \add ≈including\add* giving him Isaac¦110937.\x + \xo 24:3: a \xt Gen 12:1-9; \xo b \xt Gen 21:1-3.\x*
\v 4 Then¦110939 I gave Yacob and Esau to Isaac¦110940, and I gave Esau the hill country of Seir¦110952 \add ≈but\add* Yacob and his sons¦110956 went down to Egypt¦110958.\x + \xo 24:4: a \xt Gen 25:24-26; \xo b \xt Gen 36:8; Deu 2:5; \xo c \xt Gen 46:1-7.\x*
\v 5 I sent¦110960 Mosheh¦110963 and Aharon¦110966 and I damaged Egypt¦110970 internally, and then I brought¦110975 you¦110976 all out \add again\add*.\x + \xo 24:5: \xt Exo 3:1–12:42.\x*
\v 6 I brought¦110978 your ancestors¦110981 out of Egypt¦110982, and you all came¦110983 to the \add edge\add* of the Red Sea. \add ≈The Egyptians\add* chased after¦110987 \add *them\add* with chariots¦110989 and horsemen¦110990\x + \xo 24:6-7: \xt Exo 14:1-31.\x*
\v 7 and \add @the people\add* cried¦110995 out to Yahweh¦110998, and he placed darkness¦111000 between you and the Egyptians. \add After bringing you all through the sea,\add* he brought¦111005 the sea over \add ≈the Egyptian army and drowned them\add*. Your \add own\add* eyes¦111012 saw what I did to Egypt¦111017. Then¦110995 you all lived¦111018 a long time in the wilderness¦111019.
\p
\v 8 “\add After that,\add* I brought¦111023 you to the region of the Amorites¦111029 who lived¦111030 on the \add ≈eastern\add* side of the Yordan¦111032, and they battled against you all, \add ≈but I gave¦111035 you victory over them\add* and I destroyed¦111042 them from \add ≈ahead of you\add* and you all took¦111038 over their¦111041 land.\x + \xo 24:8: \xt Num 21:21-35.\x*
\v 9 Then¦111045 (Zippor's¦111049 son) King¦111053 Balak¦111046 of Moab¦111051 \add ≈prepared his warriors\add* and fought against \add *you all\add* and he \add ≈summoned\add* (Beor's¦111059 son) Balaam¦111056 to curse¦111060 you.\x + \xo 24:9-10: \xt Num 22:1–24:25.\x*
\v 10 \add ≈But¦111063\add* I wasn't willing¦111064 to listen¦111065 to Balaam¦111066, \add ≈so instead,\add* he blessed¦111067 you all repeatedly and I rescued¦111070 you from \add ≈King Balak\add*.
\v 11 Then¦111074 you crossed¦111074 over the Yordan¦111077 \add river\add* and \add ≈arrived at\add* Yericho. The men of Yericho fought¦111082 against you all, \add as did\add* the Amorites¦111087, the Perizzites¦111088, the Canaanites¦111089, the Hittites¦111090, the Girgashites¦111091, the Hivites, and the Yebusites \add ≈but I helped you all to defeat them\add*.\x + \xo 24:11: a \xt Josh 3:14-17; \xo b \xt Josh 6:1-21.\x*
\v 12 I sent¦111098 hornets¦111102\f + \fr 24:12 \ft The Hebrew word ‘צִרְעָה’ (‘hornet’, but pluralised here in the OET-RV) may have some non-literal meaning here, e.g., ‘panic’, or it may be a general reference to any manifestation of God's anger.\f* \add ≈ahead¦111099 of you all\add* and they drove¦111103 out the two¦111106 Amorite¦111108 kings¦111107—it wasn't your¦111099 swords¦111110 or bows that did it.\x + \xo 24:12: \xt Exo 23:28; Deu 7:20.\x*
\v 13 \add ≈So¦111114\add* I gave¦111114 you all a land which you didn't \add ≈earn yourselves\add* and cities¦111123 to live in that you all didn't build yourselves. You all are \add ≈benefitting from\add* vineyards¦111130 and olive¦111131 groves¦111131 that you didn't plant¦111135.”\x + \xo 24:13: \xt Deu 6:10-11.\x*
\p
\v 14 \add The Yehoshua continued,\add* “Now you all must \add ≈respect\add* Yahweh and faithfully¦111147 serve him with \add ≈your complete beings\add*. And you all must remove the \add ≈idols\add* that your ancestors¦111154 served¦111153 beyond¦111155 the \add ≈Euphrates\add* and in Egypt¦111157, and \add only\add* serve Yahweh.
\v 15 But if \add ≈you all dislike\add* serving Yahweh, then choose¦111170 for yourselves today who you will serve: perhaps the gods your¦111165 fathers¦111184 \add once\add* served beyond¦111186 the \add ≈Euphrates\add*, or the gods of the Amorite¦111194 \add people\add* in whose¦111198 land you are \add now\add* living¦111197. But as for me and my household¦111200, we will serve Yahweh.”
\p
\v 16 “\add ≈We'd¦111213 never even consider\add* leaving Yahweh¦111215 to serve¦111216 other¦111218 gods¦111217,” the people¦111208 responded¦111209,
\v 17 “because Yahweh¦111221 is our God¦111222. He is the one who brought¦111224 us and our ancestors¦111228 out from slavery¦111232 in the land of Egypt¦111230, and who did those great¦111239 miracles \add ≈right in front of\add* our eyes¦111235. Also, he looked after us \add ≈on our entire¦111242 journey\add* and among all the people¦111249 groups that we passed¦111251 by.
\v 18 Yahweh drove¦111254 all the peoples¦111260 out \add ≈ahead of us\add*, even the Amorites¦111263 who lived in that region. \add So¦111254\add* we too we will serve¦111270 Yahweh because he is our¦111266 God¦111277.”
\p
\v 19 “You all won't be able to serve¦111287 Yahweh¦111290,” \add ≈warned\add* Yehoshua, “because he's a God \add ≈who cannot mix with sin\add*. He's a jealous¦111298 God—he won't \add ≈forgive¦111302 your rebellion and disobedience\add*.
\v 20 If you abandon¦111307 Yahweh¦111310 and serve¦111311 the gods¦111312 of \add ≈other nations\add*, then he'll turn¦111314 and do harm to you all and destroy you, \add ≈even if he's previously been\add* good¦111322 to you all.”
\p
\v 21 \add ≈But¦111325\add* the people¦111326 \add ≈answered\add* Yehoshua, “No, we¦111335 will worship Yahweh¦111334.”
\v 22 Then¦111337 Yehoshua \add ≈cautioned\add* the people¦111341, “You all are witnesses against yourselves, that you yourselves have chosen¦111348 to serve¦111353 Yahweh¦111352.”
\p “\add We are\add* witnesses,” they \add ≈confirmed\add*.
\p
\v 23 “Then¦111358 \add you all go right\add* now and remove¦111359 the foreign¦111363 gods¦111362 that you already have, and turn your¦111365 hearts¦111369 towards Yahweh¦111372, the God¦111373 of Yisrael¦111374,” \add said Yehoshua\add*.
\p
\v 24 “We¦111380 will serve¦111385 our God¦111384 Yahweh¦111383, and we will listen¦111387 to his¦111386 voice¦111386,” the people¦111377 \add ≈replied\add*.
\p
\v 25 \add ≈So¦111389\add* Yehoshua¦111390 \add ≈made a formal agreement\add* with the people¦111392 in Shekem¦111399 on that day¦111393, \add ≈establishing rules and laws\add* for them.
\v 26 \add *He\add* wrote¦111401 \add *them\add* in the book of God's law. Then¦111401 he took¦111410 a large¦111412 stone¦111411 and set it up there¦111414 beneath the oak tree that was \add ≈by Yahweh's sacred¦111418 tent¦111418\add*.
\v 27 “Look at this stone¦111430,” Yehoshua said¦111422 to all the people¦111428. “It will be for a witness against us, because it has heard¦111439 \add ≈everything that Yahweh¦111444 has instructed\add* us, and it will be for a witness against you all, in case you act deceptively against your God¦111454.”
\rem /s1 Buried in the Promised Land
\v 28 Then¦111456 Yehoshua¦111457 sent¦111456 \add all\add* the people¦111460 off to go to their¦111462 allotted regions.

\v 29 After all that, Nun's¦111473 son and Yahweh's servant¦111474 Yehoshua died¦111469 at the age of 110.
\v 30 They buried¦111482 him in his alloted property at Timnat-Serah which¦111489 is in the Efrayim¦111492 hill country¦111490 north¦111493 of Mt. Ga'ash.\x + \xo 24:30: \xt Josh 19:49-50.\x*
\p
\v 31 The \add ≈Israelis\add* had served¦111498 Yahweh all through Yehoshua's lifetime and throughout the lifetimes of the elders¦111509 who lived longer than Yehoshua and who had experienced everything that Yahweh had done for Yisrael¦111499.
\p
\v 32 They buried¦111538 Yosef's bones¦111528 (that they had carried out from Egypt¦111537) in Shekem—in the portion of the field¦111541 that Yacob¦111544 had bought¦111543 from the sons¦111546 of Hamor¦111548 (Shekem's father¦111549) for a hundred¦111552 coins, and \add @that land\add* became the inheritance¦111558 of Yosef's descendants¦111555.\x + \xo 24:32: \xt Gen 33:19; 50:24-25; Exo 13:19; Yhn 4:5; Acts 7:16.\x*
