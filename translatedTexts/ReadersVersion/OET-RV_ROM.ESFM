\mt2 Paul's letter to the believers in
\mt1 Rome
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk Paul's letter to the believers in Rome\bk* was sent to both Jews and non-Jews who believe in, and trust, Yeshua (Jesus) the messiah. He wrote to them so that they could be prepared for when he could visit them there. Paul planned to work there with other Christians for a while, then with their help, he would travel to Spain. He wrote in order to explain his understanding of Christian faith and of day-to-day living as Christians.
\ip Paul greets the believers there in Rome and he tells them about his prayers for them. Then he tells them the theme of his letter, “how God makes us guiltless—by faith.” (1:17a). All people, Jewish or not, need to become guiltless in God's sight by means of faith in Yeshua Messiah.
\ip Next Paul tells them about new life by means of unity with the messiah thereby forming a new relationship with God. Believers will have peace from God and the power of Spirit of God will save them from the power of sin and of death. In chapters 5-8, Paul explains about the purpose of God's law and about the power of God's spirit working through believers.
\ip Paul answers the question about how Jews and non-Jews fit into God's plan for of all people. Paul explains that the unbelief of Jews is part of God's plan for a time so that the good message can be proclaimed to non-Jews. But concerning God's choosing of Jews, he loved them very much due to his promise to their ancestors, and it's as a result of them that all people can receive the love and mercy of God through the messiah Yeshua.
\ip In the ending, Paul explains how to live as a Christian, with the main need being to accept and love each other. He also includes themes like serving God, the responsibility of Christians the government, and for each individual, questions concerning the conscience. Paul ends his letter and greeting others, and by his praising God.

\v 8 I'll start by thanking¦105221 my¦105224 \nd God¦105223\nd* through¦105225 \nd Yeshua Messiah¦105227\nd* for all of you, because¦105232 the \add story about\add* your¦105231 faith¦105234 has been told in many countries.
\v 9 Yes, the \nd God¦105246\nd* that I serve in my spirit¦105251 in the good¦105255 message¦105255 about his¦105258 son, is my witness¦105241 about how I never stop mentioning¦105261 all of you¦105262
\v 10 in my¦105268 prayers¦105267—asking that somehow¦105271 \nd God¦105279\nd* will favour me by allowing me to come¦105280 to visit you¦105282
\v 11 because¦105284 I'm longing¦105283 to see¦105285 you all so that I can share¦105289 a particular spiritual¦105292 gift¦105290 with you so that you'll all be strengthened¦105295.
\v 12 I want us to \add all\add* be encouraged¦105300 together¦105300 by each other's faith¦105308—both me and all of you.

\v 14 Whether it's Greeks¦105345 or other foreigners¦105348, wise people or foolish¦105352, I have an obligation

\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 1:16: \xt Mrk 8:38.\x*I'm not ashamed¦105368 to preach the good¦105370 message¦105370 because¦105374 it \add conveys\add* God's power¦105373 to save everyone¦105379 who believes¦105381 it—to Jews first¦105384 and then non-Jews.

\s1 God's anger towards those who deny his existence
\rem /s1 The Guilt of Humankind; Human Guilt; God's judgement on sin; God's Wrath Against Mankind; God's Anger at Sin
\p
\v 18 God's severe¦105409 anger¦105409 is being¦105407 revealed¦105407 from heaven¦105412 on the ungodliness¦105415 and¦105416 disobedience of people¦105418 who limit the truth¦105421 by \add their\add* disobedience
\v 19 because the fact that there is a god has been shown to them because \nd God¦105429\nd* \add himself\add* has revealed¦105439 it.
\v 20 Ever since the creation¦105445 of the world¦105446, the invisible¦105442 attributes of God have been clearly¦105450 seen¦105450 through his workmanship¦105448—both his eternal¦105453 power¦105455 and¦105456 his divinity¦105457—so \add people\add* have no excuse.
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21: \xt Eph 4:17-18.\x*Even though they know \add about\add* \nd God¦105466\nd*, they didn't¦105467 honour or thank¦105472 him, but their theories made them incompetent and their minds turned from perception towards darkness.
\v 22 They claimed to be scientific but instead they¦105488 believed foolishness¦105488
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Deu 4:16-18.\x*and \add so\add* they¦105490 changed¦105490 the greatness of the eternal \nd God¦105495\nd* into the likeness¦105497 of an image¦105498 of a mortal¦105499 human¦105500, or birds¦105502 or animals or reptiles¦105506.
\p
\v 24 Therefore¦105507 \nd God¦105512\nd* reluctantly let their lusts lead to impurity¦105520 and the dishonouring¦105522 of their bodies¦105524 among themselves¦105527
\v 25 as they exchanged¦105530 God's truth¦105532 for a lie and now worshipped¦105539 and served the creation, instead of the creator who \add should be\add* praised throughout the ages. May¦105553 it¦105546 be so¦105553.
\p
\v 26 Because¦105554 of that¦105563, \nd God¦105559\nd* reluctantly let them exercise their dishonourable¦105562 passions¦105561 and their women exchanged¦105568 natural acts for those against nature,
\v 27 and similarly their men deserted the natural¦105584 acts towards women and stoked their lusts towards each other—man with man and the shame¦105599 that¦105604 it¦105605 produces¦105600, and then received back in themselves¦105611 the payment which¦105604 is appropriate¦105605 for such deception¦105607.
\p
\v 28 They didn't¦105615 want to know¦105621 about \nd God¦105618\nd* and¦105613 so he reluctantly let their depraved minds be filled with unhelpful thoughts
\v 29 and so they were filled¦105633 with disobedience, wickedness¦105638, greediness¦105640, and malice, and full of envy, murder¦105644, strife¦105645, and deceit¦105647, \add becoming\add* malicious, gossips¦105649,
\v 30 slanderers¦105650, god-haters, abusers¦105652, proud¦105653, braggers¦105654, inventors¦105655 of evil¦105656, unable to be persuaded by \add their\add* parents¦105657,
\v 31 unintelligent¦105659, untrustworthy¦105660, unloving¦105661, \add and\add* unmerciful¦105663.
\v 32 They know that \nd God¦105668\nd* must exercise justice towards those doing¦105675 such things, yet they not only practice those things which will lead to a death¦105677 sentence, but they also approve when others do them.

\s1 Judgement even for those without the written law
\rem /s1 The Righteous Judgment of God; God's Righteous Judgment; God's Judgment of Sin
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1: \xt Mat 7:1; Luk 6:37.\x*So¦105690 there's no excuse for anyone who judges others because¦105709 you're condemning¦105707 yourselves¦105706 if you're doing¦105711 those same things that you're judging other for
\v 2 because we¦105714 know that God's judgement¦105719 is based on the factual accounts of what \add each person\add* is doing.
\v 3 But maybe you're¦105731 thinking that you can judge others doing¦105743 these things and yet \add somehow\add* escape¦105747 God's judgement¦105749 when you do them yourself¦105744?
\v 4 Or maybe you're¦105764 \add taking advantage\add* of God's kindness and patience¦105763 without realising that his¦105757 kindness was \add meant\add* to lead you towards repentance¦105772?
\v 5 But it's your¦105779 hardness¦105778 and failure to repent that \add causing\add* severe anger to be stored up for the day of God's judgement¦105794 when \add all\add* will be revealed \add including\add* his severe anger
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6: \xt Psa 62:12; Prv 24:12.\x*as each person will be \add judged\add* by their actions.
\v 7 Those who've endured¦105807 to do good¦105809 expecting praise and honour¦105812 and to escape destruction, \add will be given\add* eternal¦105817 life¦105816,
\v 8 but those who've \add lived out\add* their selfish¦105821 ambition¦105821 and refused to believe the truth¦105826 but \add let themselves get\add* persuaded¦105827 by disobedience, \add will meet with\add* severe¦105832 anger¦105832 and rage¦105834.
\v 9 For every¦105840 person doing evil¦105846, there will be tribulation and distress¦105838—to Jews first¦105849 and then to non-Jews,
\v 10 but to those who do good¦105862, there'll be praise and honour¦105855 and peace¦105857—to Jews first¦105865 and then to non-Jews
\v 11 \x + \xo 2:11: \xt Deu 10:17.\x*because¦105869 \nd God¦105874\nd* doesn't \add indulge in\add* favouritism¦105871.
\p
\v 12 Those not under the \add Jewish\add* laws and yet sinned, they'll be judged without the law, and those who knew the laws and sinned, will be judged by the law,
\v 13 because¦105891 listening¦105893 to the law doesn't make \add people\add* right¦105896 with \nd God¦105899\nd*, but¦105900 rather it's those who obey the law who will be declared guiltless.
\v 14 Whenever other nations don't have \add Jewish\add* law but naturally¦105913 obey what's in the laws, then even those that¦105909 don't have \add our\add* laws have their own law.
\v 15 They demonstrate that they effectively have \add God's\add* law written¦105932 in their minds and which matches their consciences¦105940, and between¦105942 the two they'll be either accused¦105946 or defended¦105949
\v 16 on the day¦105952 when \nd God¦105958\nd* through \nd Messiah¦105968 Yeshua\nd*, judges people's¦105962 private \add lives\add* as I've shared \add as part of\add* the good¦105965 message¦105965.
\s1 Jews who disobey their laws
\rem /s1 The Jews and their law
\p
\v 17 But if you're a Jew and trusting in the law and boasting¦105982 about \add being¦105976 chosen by\add* \nd God¦105984\nd*
\v 18 and knowing his will and knowing what's important because of familiarity with the law,
\v 19 and if you've persuaded¦105997 yourself¦105999 that you're a guide¦106000 for the blind¦106002 and a light¦106003 to those who are in darkness¦106006,
\v 20 and that you're an instructor¦106007 to foolish¦106008 people and a teacher¦106009 of children, and that you appear¦106013 to be knowledgeable¦106015 about the truth¦106018 of the law,
\v 21 then why do you teach others when you haven't \add even\add* taught¦106024 yourself¦106026? You announce that stealing is wrong, but you're¦106033 a thief.
\v 22 You teach about not messing with other people's spouses, yet you do it yourself. You detest¦106040 idols¦106042, but you sneak money out of the temple¦106043.
\v 23 You boast¦106047 about \add being a student \add* of the law, but you¦106055 dishonour¦106055 \nd God¦106054\nd* by breaking the laws.
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24: \xt Isa 52:5 (LXX).\x*\add Yes,\add* it's been written¦106068: ‘God's name¦106058 is slandered¦106063 among¦106064 the nations because¦106061 of you¦106062 all.’
\p
\v 25 Circumcision¦106069 is of value if you're keeping the law, but if you're breaking the laws, then your¦106083 circumcision¦106082 is just the same as if you're uncircumcised¦106084,
\v 26 so if uncircumcised \add peoples\add* act justly according to the law, even though they're not physically circumcised¦106101, \add God\add* will consider them as his¦106099 people.
\v 27 \add Yes, those peoples\add* who are not circumcised but keep the law, will be judging¦106104 you¦106112 who were given the law in writing and¦106116 are circumcised, yet break those laws.
\v 28 A \add true\add* Jew is not just a Jew on the outside, and circumcision¦106135 isn't¦106120 just on the outside of the body¦106134,
\v 29 \x + \xo 2:29: \xt Deu 30:6.\x*but is a Jew even in their private life and through circumcision¦106143 of their heart¦106144—by the \nd spirit¦106146\nd* and not by the letter¦106148 of the law—earning praise¦106151 not from people, but from \nd God¦106158\nd*.
\c 3
\rem /s1 God's Faithfulness; God Remains Faithful
\p
\v 1 So¦106160 what advantage is it in being a Jew and what's the benefit¦106168 of circumcision¦106170?
\v 2 A lot in every¦106173 way. Firstly¦106175, Jews were entrusted¦106179 with \add the writing down\add* of God's messages.
\v 3 But what if some didn't believe? Wouldn't the unbelief¦106192 of Jews make faith¦106195 \add that comes from\add* \nd God¦106197\nd* worthless?
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4: \xt Psa 51:4 (LXX).\x*Absolutely not. Even if every¦106206 person¦106208 was a liar, \nd God¦106204\nd* is true just like it's been written¦106212 \add about him\add*:
\q1 ‘You will be proved right about what you say,
\q2 and¦106202 you'll prevail when you're judged¦106225 \add in court\add*.’
\p
\v 5 But if our¦106231 sinfulness highlights God's sinlessness, what can we¦106236 say about that? \add So\add* isn't God, the one inflicting¦106242 the severe¦106244 anger¦106244, wrong \add to punish us\add*. (Of course this is reasoning from a human¦106247 perspective.)
\v 6 Of course not, otherwise how could \nd God¦106256\nd* be able to judge the world¦106258?
\p
\v 7 But if my lie \add exposes\add* God's truth¦106263 and so brings him honour, why would he still¦106276 judge¦106280 me as a sinner¦106279?
\v 8 Some people falsely accuse us of saying, ‘Let's do evil things so that good might follow.’ Those who say that deserve their¦106302 punishment.
\s1 No person is guiltless
\rem /s1 No One is Righteous; All People Are Sinners
\p
\v 9 What then? Do \add Jews\add* have any advantage¦106308? Definitely not, because¦106313 we¦106312 showed earlier that both Jews and¦106317 other nationalities are all under¦106320 sin's \add shadow\add*
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10-12: \xt Psa 14:1-3 (LXX); Psa 53:1-3 (LXX).\x*just like it¦106324 was written¦106324 long ago:

\v 12 Everyone¦106355 has turned¦106343 away,

\q1 ‘Their lips¦106369 spray out poison.’
\q1
\v 14 \x + \xo 3:14: \xt Psa 10:7 (LXX).\x*‘Their mouths¦106373 are full of cursing¦106375 and¦106376 bitterness¦106377.’

\p
\v 19 We know that whatever the law says, it's for \add everyone¦106419\add* that the law applies to, so that no one can speak¦106417 against it, and¦106422 the whole world¦106427 will be bound by God's judgement¦106423.
\v 20 \x + \xo 3:20: \xt Psa 143:2; Gal 2:16.\x*No human will be declared guiltless in front of God by their keeping the law, because¦106441 it's the law that teaches what sin¦106444 is.
\s1 Removing the guilt from sin
\rem /s1 Righteousness through Faith; How We Are Put Right with God; Christ Took Our Punishment
\p
\v 21 But now \nd God¦106450\nd* has revealed¦106451 a way to remove guilt that's not by rules—a way that Mosheh and¦106456 the prophets¦106458 wrote about.
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Gal 2:16.\x*We can be made right¦106459 with \nd God¦106461\nd* through¦106462 faith¦106463 in \nd Yeshua Messiah¦106466\nd*. This is for \em \+nd everyone¦106466\+nd*\em* who believes¦106475 because¦106477 there's¦106478 no distinction¦106479 \add between Jews and¦106460 others\add*
\v 23 because¦106481 everyone has sinned¦106482 and¦106483 is unable to be honoured by \nd God¦106489\nd*.
\v 24 \add But\add* even without deserving it, we can be declared guiltless by God's grace¦106494 by being¦106490 bought out of slavery \add to sin\add* by \nd Messiah¦106500 Yeshua\nd*
\v 25 who God placed \add on the altar\add* as a sacrifice for sin. \add This happens¦106524\add* through¦106507 faith¦106509 in his blood¦106514 which was a sign¦106516 of his sinlessness.
\p (God hasn't yet judged those who sinned in the past
\v 26 because of his patience, waiting for the present¦106539 time¦106540 to show his righteousness¦106535 and to be fair, and to remove the guilt of those with faith¦106550 in \nd Yeshua¦106551\nd*.)
\p
\v 27 So¦106553 where¦106552 does that leave boasting¦106555? It's not in the picture. How come? Through¦106557 obeying the \add Mosheh's\add* laws? No, through¦106564 a law about faith¦106566.
\v 28 So¦106569 now we¦106567 should expect that a person¦106573 will be made guiltless by faith¦106572—not by obeying \add Mosheh's\add* laws.

\rem /s1 The Faith of Abraham; The Example of Abraham; Abraham Justified by Faith
\p
\v 1 So¦106619 what did our¦106626 physical ancestor, Abraham¦106622 discover about all this?
\v 2 Because¦106631 if Abraham¦106632 was declared guiltless because¦106631 of his actions, maybe he¦106636 could boast¦106637? But not towards¦106640 \nd God¦106642\nd*
\v 3 \x + \xo 4:3: \xt Gen 15:6; Gal 3:6.\x*because¦106644 the scriptures¦106646 say: ‘Abraham¦106650 believed¦106648 in \nd God¦106652\nd* so he was considered guiltless.’
\v 4 Now for someone who's working¦106660, their wages are considered ‘owed’, not a gift.
\v 5 However someone who's not working¦106687 but¦106685 having faith that \add God\add* will declare disobedient people as guiltless, then that person's faith is considered to make them guiltless.
\v 6 It's just like what David¦106710 said about blessing¦106713 a person¦106715 who \nd God¦106718\nd* declares as guiltless despite their actions:
\q1
\v 7 \x + \xo 4:7-8: \xt Psa 32:1-2.\x*‘Those who've been forgiven¦106725 for their lawlessness¦106727 will be happy,
\q2 and whose sins¦106732 have been covered¦106730 over.
\q1
\v 8 Anyone who \nd Yahweh¦106740\nd* declares to have no sin¦106741 will be happy.’
\p
\v 9 Is this favour shown to circumcised¦106748 Jews or is it also for non-Jews? Because¦106756 we¦106755 were saying¦106755 that Abraham¦106760 was considered guiltless because¦106756 of his faith¦106762.
\v 10 So¦106766 how did that happen? Because he was circumcised or when he was \add still\add* uncircumcised? No, it¦106767 was before he was circumcised.
\v 11 \x + \xo 4:11: \xt Gen 17:10.\x*He received¦106782 circumcision¦106783 as a sign¦106781—proof of the righteousness that he gained from his faith¦106789 while he was still uncircumcised—becoming the father¦106798 of everyone who's uncircumcised but believes¦106801 so that they'll be declared guiltless.
\v 12 So our¦106836 ancestor Abraham¦106837 is the ancestor of us as a circumcised people, not just because we're circumcised, but¦106820 also as we follow his steps¦106825 of faith¦106833 while uncircumcised¦106831.

\v 13 \x + \xo 4:13: \xt Gen 17:4-6; 22:17-18; Gal 3:29.\x*It wasn't because of \add his obeying\add* the law that it was promised¦106843 that Abraham¦106845 or his descendants¦106848 would inherit the world¦106855, but¦106856 because of \add his\add* righteousness¦106858 \add that came from his\add* faith¦106859,
\v 14 \x + \xo 4:14: \xt Gal 3:18.\x*because¦106861 if the ones \add obeying\add* the law \add can become\add* heirs¦106865, then faith¦106868 would be declared as useless and¦106869 the promise¦106872 would be invalidated,

\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 4:16: \xt Gal 3:7.\x*Because¦106886 of this, the promise to the descendants is by faith—\add given \add* not only to the ‘descendants of the law’ but also to the ‘descendants of Abraham's faith’. This promise \add is given\add* by grace¦106893 and has been confirmed¦106897,

\v 18 \x + \xo 4:18: \xt Gen 15:5.\x*\add Without any other evidence\add*, he believed¦106948 in hope itself and thus he became the father¦106953 of many nations¦106955 according¦106957 to what he had been told: ‘Your¦106964 descendants¦106963 will be like \add the sand and the stars\add*.’
\v 19 \x + \xo 4:19: \xt Gen 17:17.\x*He didn't¦106966 falter¦106967 in his faith¦106969, seeing that his body¦106974 was already¦106975 infertile being about¦106978 a hundred¦106977 years old and¦106980 with Sarah¦106985 being past menopause,
\v 20 but he didn't¦106992 show unbelief¦106995 and doubt¦106993 God's promise¦106989 when it was given¦107000, but rather he was strengthened¦106997 in his faith¦106999 and praised God,
\v 21 being quite certain that what \add God\add* promises¦107008, he's also able to do.
\v 22 Therefore¦107013 \add his faith\add* was credited to him¦107016 and he was declared guiltless.
\v 23 However that statement wasn't written¦107020 about \add Abraham\add* only,
\v 24 but¦107028 for us also who are also going¦107033 to receive the same credit because¦107030 of our faith in the \add God\add* who brought our \nd master¦107043 Yeshua\nd* back to life from the dead¦107046

\v 1 So¦107060 now because we've been declared guiltless by our faith¦107062, we can have peace¦107063 with \nd God¦107068\nd* through¦107069 our \nd master¦107071 Yeshua¦107073 Messiah¦107074\nd*.

\v 3 Not only that, but we are also boasting¦107106 even though we're still being persecuted, because we know that difficulties produce¦107116 endurance¦107115
\v 4 and endurance¦107119 shows who we really are, and knowing that produces hope,
\v 5 and¦107126 we're not disgraced¦107129 by that hope because¦107130 God's love¦107132 has been poured¦107135 out into our¦107140 hearts¦107138 through¦107141 the holy \nd spirit¦107142\nd* who has been given¦107145 to us.

\v 6 While we were still¦107155 weak and at the \add right\add* time¦107157 for ungodly¦107159 \add people\add*, the \nd messiah¦107151\nd* died¦107160 for us.

\s1 Death through Adam but life through Yeshua
\rem /s1 Adam and Christ Contrasted; Death Through Adam, Life Through Christ
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 5:12: \xt Gen 3:6.\x*Sin came into the world¦107263 through¦107278 one man, and death came as a result of sin, so death spread to everyone because¦107279 everyone has disobeyed God.
\v 13 Sin was in the world¦107290 before \add Mosheh's\add* law, but¦107292 it wasn't being charged against them, because¦107284 the law had not yet \add been given\add*.
\v 14 But death¦107302 reigned¦107300 from \add the time of\add* Adam until¦107305 \add the time of\add* Mosheh, even over those who didn't¦107310 sin in the way that Adam did—Adam\f + \fr 5:14 \ft Adam is called ‘the son of God’ in Luke 3:38.\f* who was a pattern¦107321 of the \add messiah\add* who would \add eventually\add* come.
\p
\v 15 But the gift is not like the disobedience, because¦107334 if the disobedience of one man introduced death for many, God's grace and the gift that comes from that grace is much more. That gift is the one man \nd Yeshua Messiah¦107359\nd* who has been given to very many \add people\add*.
\v 16 It only took one man who disobeyed \add to lead to\add* condemnation¦107380, and¦107364 one act of disobedience \add to lead to\add* judgement¦107376, but the gift is to bring guiltlessness despite \em many\em* acts of disobedience.
\v 17 Because¦107390 if the disobedience of one man led to death¦107398 reigning \add over us\add* through that one man, how much more will the ones receiving¦107418 an abundance¦107407 of grace¦107410 and the gift¦107413 of righteousness¦107417 be reigning in life¦107420 through the one man \nd Yeshua¦107426 Messiah¦107427\nd*.
\p
\v 18 So¦107429 just as one act of disobedience \add led\add* all people to condemnation¦107439, so also one action \add brought\add* all people to guiltlessness \add and hence to\add* life¦107450.
\v 19 The disobedience¦107455 of one man caused many people to be made sinners¦107459, so also the obedience¦107469 of one man caused many people to be made guiltless.
\p
\v 20 The law was inserted so that acts of disobedience would be plentiful, but¦107485 where¦107484 sin¦107488 has been plentiful, grace¦107491 has overflowed¦107489
\v 21 so that just as sin¦107496 reigned in death¦107499, so also grace¦107503 now reigns through righteousness¦107507, \add leading to\add* eternal¦107510 life¦107509 through our¦107517 \nd master¦107516 Yeshua¦107513 Messiah¦107514\nd*.

\v 2 Not on your life! We who died¦107533 to sin¦107535, how could we \add go back\add* to living¦107538 in it?
\v 3 Or didn't¦107544 you all realise that when we were immersed into \nd Messiah¦107550 Yeshua\nd*, we were immersed into his¦107555 death¦107554?
\v 4 \x + \xo 6:4: \xt Col 2:12.\x*Therefore¦107558 we were buried¦107557 with him through¦107560 the immersion¦107562 into death¦107565, so that just as \nd Messiah¦107569\nd* was brought back to life by the father's¦107576 power, so too we can walk in newness¦107581 of life.
\v 5 If we have joined together¦107586 in the likeness¦107589 of his¦107592 death¦107591, then we will also be \add joined\add* in the resurrection¦107596,
\v 6 knowing¦107600 that the old personality¦107605 was executed¦107606 with him so that sin would have no \add more\add* power over our¦107604 bodies and hence we no longer¦107615 need to serve it
\v 7 because¦107621 the personality that's died¦107622 has been declared free from sin¦107626.
\v 8 So¦107630 if we died¦107631 with \nd Messiah¦107633\nd*, we also believe¦107634 that we will live with him¦107638,
\v 9 knowing¦107639 that now that \nd Messiah¦107641\nd* has come back to life from the dead¦107644, he won't die again—death¦107647 has no more power over him¦107648.
\v 10 When he died, he died to sin¦107655 once and for all, but now that he lives, he lives to \add please\add* \nd God¦107663\nd*.
\v 11 So too, you¦107666 should be considering yourselves¦107668 dead¦107670 to sin¦107674, and at the same time, alive to \nd God¦107678\nd* in \nd Messiah¦107680 Yeshua\nd*.
\p
\v 12 So¦107686 therefore don't¦107685 let sin¦107689 be reigning¦107687 in your¦107693 mortal¦107692 bodies in such a way that you're submitting¦107697 to its¦107702 lusts¦107701.
\v 13 Don't be using any parts of your bodies to sin¦107712 as if they're weapons of disobedience, but instead present¦107705 yourselves¦107715 to God as if you came back to life from the dead¦107721, and use all your body parts for God as if they're weapons of righteousness¦107729
\v 14 so that sin¦107732 won't¦107736 be taking control of you—because¦107739 you're not under law but under grace¦107745.

\v 17 But be thankful¦107781 to \nd God¦107784\nd* that¦107796 \add although\add* you were all slaves¦107787 to sin¦107789, your hearts¦107794 submitted¦107790 to what was taught¦107799,

\p
\v 20 When you were all slaves¦107846 of sin¦107849, you were immune to righteousness¦107853

\v 1 So now those who are in \nd Messiah¦108401 Yeshua\nd* cannot be condemned¦108398
\v 2 because¦108411 the law of the \nd spirit¦108414\nd* of life¦108416 in him freed¦108420 you¦108421 from the law of sin¦108427 and¦108428 death¦108430.
\v 3 The law was powerless¦108433 in that it was faltering¦108438 through¦108439 our bodies. \nd God¦108443\nd* sent his son in a body¦108441 just like our sinful bodies, and concerning¦108454 sin, he condemned¦108456 sin \add itself\add* in the flesh
\v 4 so that for those of us who were no longer living according to the flesh¦108473 but¦108475 according to the \nd spirit¦108477\nd*, then the just act of the law would be fulfilled¦108467 in us.
\v 5 People who live according to their physical desires, think about physical things, but those who live according to the spirit, think about spiritual things.
\v 6 The worldly mindset \add leads to\add* death¦108499, but¦108501 the \nd spiritual¦108504\nd* mindset \add leads to\add* life¦108505 and¦108506 peace¦108507.
\v 7 The worldly mindset¦108510 is making God your enemy because it's not being¦108522 subjected¦108522 to God's law, in fact it's not even able to,
\v 8 and¦108527 those who are worldly aren't¦108533 able to bring¦108532 pleasure¦108532 to \nd God¦108531\nd*.
\p
\v 9 And all of you aren't¦108537 worldly, but in the spirit, if indeed¦108544 God's spirit is living¦108547 in you, but anyone¦108552 who doesn't have the spirit of \nd Messiah¦108554\nd*, doesn't belong to him.
\v 10 But if \nd Messiah¦108563\nd* is in you¦108565, while your body¦108568 is dead¦108569 because of sin¦108571, your \nd spirit¦108574\nd* has life¦108575 because it's \add been declared\add* guiltless.
\v 11 \x + \xo 8:11: \xt 1Cor 3:16.\x*\add Yes,\add* if the spirit of the one who brought Yeshua back to life is living in you, then the one who brought \nd Messiah¦108597\nd* Yeshua back to life will also give life to your¦108605 mortal¦108603 bodies¦108604 by means of his¦108611 spirit living inside you all.
\p
\v 12 So¦108618 then brothers¦108619 and¦108619 sisters¦108619, we don't¦108622 owe anything to our sinful natures, nor do we need worldly living¦108628.
\v 13 If you all live according¦108631 to the sinful nature, you'll die, but if you put bodily practices¦108640 to death¦108643 with \add the help of the\add* \nd spirit¦108638\nd*, you'll live,
\v 14 because¦108646 all those who are led by God's \nd spirit¦108647\nd* \add become\add* God's children.
\v 15 \x + \xo 8:15-17: \xt Gal 4:5-7.\x*You didn't¦108656 receive a spirit of slavery¦108660 to fear again¦108661, but \add rather\add* it was the spirit of adoption¦108667 as children that you all received, and \add with his help\add* we call out, ‘Father, father.’
\v 16 \add God's\add* spirit himself agrees together with our¦108680 spirit that we are God's children¦108683,
\v 17 and¦108686 if we're \add his\add* children¦108687, then we're also heirs so we'll receive an inheritance from \nd God¦108692\nd*. That makes us fellow-heirs along with \nd Messiah¦108695\nd*—if we're suffering¦108698 with him then we'll also be honoured along with him.

\rem /s1 The Future Glory
\p
\v 18 I'm sure that any sufferings¦108710 \add we experience\add* in the present¦108712 \add age\add* are nothing in comparison with the coming splendour that's going¦108716 to be revealed¦108718 to us
\v 19 because¦108722 \add all of\add* creation¦108725 is eagerly¦108723 expecting¦108723 and waiting¦108732 for God's children to be revealed.
\v 20 \x + \xo 8:20: \xt Gen 3:17-19.\x*\add Yes,\add* all of creation¦108737 has been subjected to lack of purpose, not willingly¦108740 but because¦108742 it was decided by the one who subjected it, but \add it remains with\add* the hope
\v 21 that it too will be freed from the slavery¦108758 of corruption¦108760 and then \add released\add* into the freedom of the splendour of God's children¦108767,
\v 22 because¦108772 we're aware that all of creation¦108776 is groaning¦108777 and¦108778 suffering\f + \fr 8:22 \ft The word picture here is one of childbirth.\f* along with us right through to the present time¦108781.
\v 23 \x + \xo 8:23: \xt 2Cor 5:2-4.\x*And not only that, but we ourselves who have the initial tastes of the \nd spirit¦108792\nd* \add life\add*, we also are groaning¦108800 and like children waiting¦108802 for our¦108807 bodies to be set free from slavery
\v 24 because we¦108811 were saved¦108811 having hope, but¦108813 if you can see it then it's not hope, because you don't¦108815 need to hope for something that you can \add already\add* see.
\v 25 So we hope for what we can't¦108829 \add yet\add* see and \add so\add* we have to patiently keep waiting¦108834.
\p
\v 26 Similarly the spirit also helps \add us\add* with our¦108845 weaknesses¦108844, because¦108847 we don't¦108853 \add even\add* know what to pray for, but the spirit intercedes¦108859 with groanings¦108862 that we can't¦108853 put into words.
\v 27 The one who searches¦108866 our hearts¦108868 knows the mindset¦108872 of the spirit because¦108875 the spirit intercedes for the believers as \nd God¦108877\nd* desires.
\rem /s1 More Than Conquerors
\p
\v 28 We know that \nd God¦108887\nd* makes all things work together¦108890 for good¦108894 for those who love him—those who are being¦108899 called¦108898 according¦108896 to \add his\add* purpose¦108897.
\v 29 Because¦108900 those he foreknew¦108902, he also predetermined¦108904 \add to be\add* similar¦108905 to his son's image¦108907, so that \add his son\add* would become the eldest of many siblings.
\v 30 The ones he'd predetermined¦108923 he also called, and the ones he'd called, he also declared guiltless, and the ones declared guiltless, he also honoured \add in heaven\add*.
\s1 Nothing can separate us from God's love
\rem /s1 God's Love in Christ Jesus
\p
\v 31 So¦108942 then, what can we¦108943 say about all this? If \nd God¦108948\nd* is for us, who is against¦108952 us?
\v 32 If he didn't¦108959 spare¦108960 his own son but gave¦108965 him \add to be executed\add* for us, won't¦108959 the two of them also give us everything else?
\v 33 Who will bring charges against¦108981 those chosen¦108982 by God? God is the one declaring \add us\add* guiltless.
\v 34 So who's the one condemning¦108989 \add us\add*? \nd Messiah¦108993 Yeshua\nd* (the one who died¦108996 but¦108998 came back to life and who's now \add sitting\add* beside \nd God¦109009\nd*) is also pleading¦109012 \em for\em* us.
\v 35 Who will separate¦109018 us from Messiah's love¦109022? Tribulation¦109030 or distress¦109032 or persecution¦109034 or famine¦109036 or poverty or danger¦109040 or execution?
\v 36 \x + \xo 8:36: \xt Psa 44:22.\x*As it's been written¦109044:

\q1 We were counted¦109052 like sheep¦109054 \add ready to be\add* slaughtered¦109055.’
\m
\v 37 But in all that, we¦109060 are more than conquerors¦109060 through¦109061 the one who loved¦109063 us.
\v 38 \add Yes,\add* I've been persuaded¦109065 that neither¦109068 death¦109069 or life¦109071, angels or rulers¦109075, present¦109082 or future events, powers¦109086,

\v 2 that my sorrow is extensive and¦109133 the sorrow in my heart¦109137 just won't stop
\v 3 because¦109140 I myself¦109146 was hoping¦109139 to be a sacrifice from the \nd messiah¦109150\nd* for my brothers¦109153 and¦109153 sisters¦109153, my fellow-citizens in this world.

\p
\v 6 But it's not that God's message¦109213 has fallen¦109211. Not all of Yisrael's descendants are pro-Yisrael,

\v 8 That isn't¦109241 \add talking about\add* worldly children—these¦109246 are God's children, but the children of the promise¦109254 are being¦109255 counted¦109255 as descendants¦109257.
\v 9 \x + \xo 9:9: \xt Gen 18:10.\x*Because¦109259 this is the message¦109261 of the promise¦109258: ‘I will be coming¦109267 and¦109268 Sarah¦109271 will have a son.’
\p

\v 5 \x + \xo 10:5: \xt Lev 18:5.\x*Mosheh wrote this about the righteousness¦109752 of The Law: ‘The person¦109762 who practices¦109760 it, will live by it.’
\v 6 \x + \xo 10:6-8: \xt Deu 30:12-14.\x*But the righteousness¦109771 \add based on\add* faith¦109770 says: ‘Don't \add speculate\add* in your¦109779 mind¦109778 about who will go up to heaven¦109784 in order to bring¦109788 \nd Messiah¦109787\nd* down,
\v 7 and don't ask about who will be going down to the pit in order to bring¦109800 \nd Messiah¦109797\nd* up.’
\v 8 So what does the righteousness \add based on\add* faith say? \add It says:\add* ‘The message is close to you—it's in your¦109812 mouth¦109811 and heart¦109816.’ That's the message of faith that¦109824 we've been preaching¦109825:

\v 10 because¦109857 it's the belief¦109858 in your mind¦109856 that leads to righteousness¦109860 and¦109862 it's the confession¦109863 from your mouth¦109861 that leads to salvation¦109865.
\v 11 \x + \xo 10:11: \xt Isa 28:16 (LXX).\x*As the scriptures¦109869 say: ‘Anyone who believes¦109872 in him¦109874 won't¦109875 \add end up\add* disgraced¦109876.’
\v 12 There's no distinction¦109880 between¦109881 Jew and¦109883 non-Jew, because¦109886 \add we\add* all have the same¦109887 \nd master¦109888\nd* who gives generously to everyone who makes an appeal to him¦109895,

\p
\v 14 How, then¦109915, could they appeal to a god that they don't¦109912 \add even\add* believe in? And how could they believe if they haven't \add even\add* heard¦109921 \add about him\add*? Then¦109915 how would they hear if no one was preaching¦109929 \add to them\add*?
\v 15 \x + \xo 10:15: \xt Isa 52:7.\x*And who would be \add there\add* preaching if no one was sent¦109936 out just like it's been written¦109939: ‘It's so wonderful that these people came and¦109931 preached the good message¦109946.’?
\v 16 But not everyone accepted the good¦109958 message¦109958, because¦109965 just like \add the prophet\add* Yeshayah wrote:\x + \xo 10:16: \xt Isa 53:1 (LXX).\x* ‘\nd Yahweh¦109967\nd*, who believed¦109969 our¦109972 report¦109971?’
\v 17 And so faith¦109975 comes by hearing—\add ≈listening to\add* Messiah's message¦109982.
\p
\v 18 But then I'd ask: Maybe they haven't heard¦109989 \add it\add*? Indeed¦109990 they have. \add It's written:\add*\x + \xo 10:18: \xt Psa 19:4 (LXX).\x*

\m
\v 19 But \add again\add* I'd ask: Didn't the Israelis know? \add Well,\add* firstly Mosheh wrote:\x + \xo 10:19: \xt Deu 32:21.\x*
\q1 ‘I'll be making you all jealous¦110019

\v 1 Therefore¦110066 I'm asking¦110065: Did \nd God¦110070\nd* push his¦110075 \add chosen\add* people¦110073 away? May it¦110079 never be, because¦110081 I also am an Israeli¦110083, a descendant of Abraham¦110087 in the tribe¦110088 of Benyamin.\x + \xo 11:1: \xt Php 3:5.\x*
\v 2 \add No,\add* God didn't¦110100 push away his¦110096 people¦110095 that he knew before \add he chose them\add*. Or don't¦110100 you know what Eliyah wrote when he pleaded¦110109 with God to deal with Yisrael:\x + \xo 11:2-3: \xt 1Ki 19:10,14.\x*
\v 3 ‘\nd Yahweh¦110116\nd*, they killed¦110120 your prophets¦110118 and tore down your altars¦110123, and I was left alone¦110128 and now they want to kill me!’
\v 4 But what was the revelation¦110139 that¦110149 was given to him¦110137:\x + \xo 11:4: \xt 1Ki 19:18.\x* ‘I've kept aside seven¦110143 thousand¦110143 others who haven't worshipped Baal¦110150.’
\v 5 So¦110152 too also at the present¦110156 time¦110157, there's a small proportion who've been chosen by \add God's\add* grace¦110161.
\v 6 So if it's by grace, then it's no longer by their actions, otherwise¦110171 the grace wouldn't be grace \add at all\add*.
\p
\v 7 What's¦110193 \add the conclusion\add* then? The Israelis didn't¦110199 find what they were looking¦110194 for¦110194. Only the chosen ones reaching it and the rest were hardened¦110208
\v 8 just like is was written¦110212:\x + \xo 11:8: \xt Deu 29:4; Isa 29:10.\x*
\q1 ‘\nd God¦110217\nd* gave them a lethargic spirit¦110218:
\q1 Eyes which can't see and ears which can't hear¦110228,
\q2 \add even\add* to this very day.’
\p
\v 9 And as David¦110235 wrote:\x + \xo 11:9-10: \xt Psa 69:22-23 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Let their¦110240 table¦110239 become¦110237 a trap for them—
\q2 a temptation that will pay them back.
\q1
\v 10 Let their eyes¦110255 be darkened¦110253 so they can't¦110258 see,
\q1 and¦110260 their backs be bent through¦110264 all time¦110265.’

\p
\v 11 So¦110268 now I ask: didn't¦110269 they stumble¦110270 so that they would fall? May it¦110274 never be. But because of their¦110277 disobedience, salvation¦110280 came to non-Jews in order to make \add Jews\add* envious.
\v 12 But if their disobedience \add led to\add* gain for the \add rest of the\add* world¦110293 and¦110294 if their loss \add led to\add* gain for the non-Jews, how much more their fullness¦110303?
\s1 The grafting in of non-Jews
\rem /s1 The Salvation of the Gentiles
\p
\v 13 But \add now\add* I am speaking¦110309 to you¦110305 all non-Jews. Since I am indeed¦110314 a missionary to the non-Jews, I take pride in my¦110323 ministry,
\v 14 hoping that somehow¦110327 I might make my¦110329 fellow Jews envious and¦110332 might save¦110333 some of them.
\v 15 Because¦110338 if their rejection¦110341 \add of the messiah\add* meant that \add the rest of\add* the world¦110344 would be reconciled¦110343, what else could their acceptance¦110348 bring other than \add coming back to\add* life¦110351 from the dead¦110353.
\p
\v 16 If the first¦110358 portion \add of dough\add* is holy, so is the lump, and¦110363 if the root is holy, so are the branches¦110370.
\v 17 But if some of the branches¦110375 were broken¦110376 off, and you \add non-Jews\add* who are like a wild, olive tree were grafted into them and so you too were able to share in the growth of the olive tree that was \add sourced\add* in the root,
\v 18 then don't¦110394 brag that you're better than the branches¦110397. If you must boast, remember that you're not supporting the root, but¦110399 the root is supporting you.
\p
\v 19 \add Ah,\add* but then you'll say, ‘Branches were broken¦110414 off so that we could be grafted in.’
\v 20 \add Well\add* you're right. They were broken¦110424 off because of their¦110421 unbelief¦110422, and \add it's true\add* that you're there because of your faith¦110428. But don't get a big head—maintain your reverence \add for God\add*,
\v 21 because¦110438 if he didn't¦110446 spare the natural¦110443 branches¦110445 \add when they showed unbelief\add*, then he won't¦110446 spare you either.
\v 22 So¦110454 you can both God's kindness and his severity: those who disobeyed \add experienced\add* his severity but you \add experienced\add* his kindness. Otherwise you also will be pruned off,
\v 23 and¦110486 also if they turn from their unbelief¦110492, they'll be grafted \add back\add* in, because¦110495 \nd God¦110498\nd* has the power¦110494 to do that.
\v 24 If were cut off an olive tree that's \em wild\em* by nature, and contrary¦110513 to normal practice were grafted into a \em cultivated¦110517\em* olive tree, how much more would those who naturally belong be grafted into their¦110525 own olive tree!

\v 26 and¦110559 then all the Jews will be saved¦110563 as it's been written¦110565:\x + \xo 11:26: \xt Isa 59:20-21 (LXX).\x*

\v 31 Those \add Jews\add* disbelieved¦110635 so that¦110636 as you \add receive\add* mercy, they may also now be shown¦110643 mercy,
\v 32 because¦110645 \nd God¦110647\nd* imprisoned¦110644 them all in disbelief¦110653 so that¦110655 he might show mercy¦110657 to everyone.

\v 1 So¦110714 then, brothers¦110716 and sisters¦110716, with compassion¦110719 from God I urge you to present¦110722 your bodies¦110724 as a living¦110728 sacrifice¦110727—holy \add and\add* pleasing¦110732 to God—your logical¦110736 \add and\add* sacred¦110737 service¦110737.

\s1 Respect authorities and pay tax
\rem /s1 Respect for Authority; Being Subject to Authorities; Submission to the Authorities; Duties toward State Authorities
\p
\v 1 Everyone¦111046 should¦111051 be subject¦111051 to the authorities who are over them because¦111054 there's¦111055 no authority except¦111057 through God and they're appointed¦111069 by God.
\v 2 So anyone opposing¦111073 authority¦111075 has rebelled against what \nd God¦111078\nd* has instituted, and¦111082 everyone who rebels is bringing judgement¦111085 on themselves¦111084
\v 3 because¦111088 rulers¦111089 don't evoke fear¦111092 in those doing good, just those doing evil¦111102. Oh, so you don't want to be afraid of the authorities¦111109, then¦111105 do good and¦111105 you'll receive praise¦111115 from them \add instead\add*
\v 4 because they're God's servants for your good. But if you're doing evil, then you should \add rightly\add* be afraid because the authorities aren't¦111132 armed without reason—they're God's servants to dispense severe¦111144 anger¦111144 to those doing evil.
\v 5 Hence it's necessary¦111154 to be subject¦111155 to them, not only \add for fear\add* of their severe¦111161 anger¦111161, but¦111162 also because of your consciences¦111166.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 13:6-7: \xt Mat 22:21; Mrk 12:17; Luk 20:25.\x*That's also why you all should pay the taxes¦111171 that you owe, because \add the authorities\add* are God's servants and work hard to do that.
\v 7 So fulfil all of your obligations¦111185: if it's tax then pay it, or revenue then give it, or if it's respect then show it, or giving honour then do it.

\v 4 Because¦111877 everything that was written in the past, was written for teaching¦111884 us so that through endurance¦111890 and through the encouragement from the scriptures¦111896, we would have hope.
\v 5 May the \nd God¦111904\nd* of endurance¦111906 and¦111907 encouragement help you¦111912 all to think¦111915 likewise, just like \nd Yeshua Messiah¦111919\nd* did,
\v 6 so that you'll all be united in your purpose and your teaching, thus honouring the \nd God¦111929\nd* and father¦111931 of our¦111934 \nd master¦111933\nd*, \nd Yeshua¦111935 Messiah¦111936\nd*.

\v 13 May the \nd God¦112045\nd* of hope that you believe¦112063 in fill¦112049 you all with happiness and¦112044 peace¦112059 so that your hope in the power¦112072 of the holy \nd spirit¦112073\nd* will be \add grow to be\add* plentiful¦112066.
\s1 Paul as missionary to non-Jews
\rem /s1 Paul the Minister to the Gentiles; Paul's Reason for Writing So Boldly
\p
\v 14 My¦112078 brothers¦112077 and sisters¦112077, I've also been persuaded¦112075 about you myself¦112080, that having¦112091 been filled¦112091 with knowledge¦112094, you're also full of goodness¦112090 and able to rebuke each other.
\v 15 But I wrote¦112102 to you more boldly¦112100, partly to remind¦112111 you all because¦112113 of the grace¦112115 given¦112117 to me by \nd God¦112122\nd*
\v 16 so that I'd be a minister¦112128 to the non-Jews for \nd Messiah¦112129 Yeshua\nd*, sharing God's good¦112137 message¦112137 so that the offering¦112145 of the non-Jews would be acceptable¦112148 \add to him\add*, having¦112149 been purified by the holy \nd spirit¦112151\nd*. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
\v 17 Therefore¦112155 I'm boasting¦112157 in \nd Messiah¦112159 Yeshua\nd* about things \add to do with\add* \nd God¦112164\nd*.
\v 18 I wouldn't dare to speak¦112172 about anything¦112170 that wasn't done through¦112177 me by \nd Messiah¦112176\nd*, that led to the obedience¦112182 of non-Jews by \add my\add* message¦112184 and¦112185 \add by my\add* working
\v 19 powerful miracles and amazing things in the power of God's \nd spirit¦112196\nd*, so that from Yerushalem all the way around¦112204 to Illyricum¦112207, I've obeyed the Messiah's good message¦112210.
\v 20 I was enthusiastic to be preaching¦112217 the good¦112217 message¦112217 wherever¦112219 \nd Messiah¦112222\nd* wasn't known about so that I wouldn't be building¦112228 on other's foundations¦112227,
\v 21 \x + \xo 15:21: \xt Isa 52:15 (LXX).\x*but as it has been written¦112231:
\q1 ‘Anyone who hasn't been told about him,
\q2 they will be seeing¦112238,

\v 27 \x + \xo 15:27: \xt 1Cor 9:11.\x*They took pleasure¦112333 \add but\add* they're also in debt to them, because¦112342 if the non-Jews have shared¦112346 in \add Jewish\add* spiritual¦112344 things, then they should also minister¦112354 to them with material¦112353 things.
\v 28 So¦112357 then, having done that and¦112359 having guaranteed \add heavenly rewards\add* for them, I will go to Spain¦112371 by way of your \add place\add*,
\v 29 and¦112374 I know that when I come, I'll come \add bearing\add* Messiah's full blessing¦112381.

\v 30 So¦112388 brothers¦112390 and sisters¦112390, I'm urging you¦112389 by our¦112394 \nd master¦112393 Yeshua Messiah¦112396\nd* and by the love¦112400 of the \nd spirit¦112402\nd*, to contend¦112403 along with me in praying to \nd God¦112412\nd* for me
\v 31 that I will escape from \add the schemes of\add* those in Yudea¦112420 who refuse to believe. Also pray that my¦112426 ministry in Yerushalem would be acceptable¦112432 to the believers there
\v 32 so that by God's will, I can happily come¦112445 to your place and be refreshed \add there\add* with you all.
\v 33 \add May\add* the \nd God¦112459\nd* of peace¦112461 be with all of you¦112464. May it¦112517 be so¦112517.
