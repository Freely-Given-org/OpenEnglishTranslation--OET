\mt2 Paul's letter to the believers in
\mt1 Rome
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk Paul's letter to the believers in Rome\bk* was sent to both Jews and non-Jews who believe in, and trust, Yeshua (Jesus) the messiah. He wrote to them so that they could be prepared for when he could visit them there. Paul planned to work there with other Christians for a while, then with their help, he would travel to Spain. He wrote in order to explain his understanding of Christian faith and of day-to-day living as Christians.
\ip Paul greets the believers there in Rome and he tells them about his prayers for them. Then he tells them the theme of his letter, “how God makes us guiltless—by faith.” (1:17a). All people, Jewish or not, need to become guiltless in God's sight by means of faith in Yeshua Messiah.
\ip Next Paul tells them about new life by means of unity with the messiah thereby forming a new relationship with God. Believers will have peace from God and the power of Spirit of God will save them from the power of sin and of death. In chapters 5-8, Paul explains about the purpose of God's law and about the power of God's spirit working through believers.
\ip Paul answers the question about how Jews and non-Jews fit into God's plan for of all people. Paul explains that the unbelief of Jews is part of God's plan for a time so that the good message can be proclaimed to non-Jews. But concerning God's choosing of Jews, he loved them very much due to his promise to their ancestors, and it's as a result of them that all people can receive the love and mercy of God through the messiah Yeshua.
\ip In the ending, Paul explains how to live as a Christian, with the main need being to accept and love each other. He also includes themes like serving God, the responsibility of Christians the government, and for each individual, questions concerning the conscience. Paul ends his letter and greeting others, and by his praising God.

\v 8 I'll start by thanking¦106154 my¦106157 \nd God¦106156\nd* through¦106158 \nd Yeshua¦106159 Messiah¦106160\nd* for all of you, because¦106165 the \add story about\add* your¦106164 faith¦106167 has been told in many countries.
\v 9 Yes, the \nd God¦106179\nd* that I serve in my spirit¦106184 in the good¦106188 message¦106188 about his¦106191 son, is my witness¦106174 about how I never stop mentioning¦106194 all of you¦106195

\v 11 because¦106217 I'm longing¦106216 to see¦106218 you all so that I can share¦106222 a particular spiritual¦106225 gift¦106223 with you so that you'll all be strengthened¦106228.

\s1 God's anger towards those who deny his existence
\rem /s1 The Guilt of Humankind; Human Guilt; God's judgement on sin; God's Wrath Against Mankind; God's Anger at Sin
\p
\v 18 God's severe¦106342 anger¦106342 is being¦106340 revealed¦106340 from heaven¦106345 on the ungodliness¦106348 and¦106349 disobedience of people¦106351 who limit the truth¦106354 by \add their\add* disobedience
\v 19 because the fact that there is a God has been shown to them because God \add himself\add* has revealed¦106372 it¦106372.
\v 20 Ever since the creation¦106378 of the world¦106379, the invisible¦106375 attributes of God have been clearly¦106383 seen¦106383 through his workmanship¦106381—both his eternal¦106386 power¦106388 and¦106389 his divinity¦106390—so \add people\add* have no excuse.
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21: \xt Eph 4:17-18.\x*Even though they know \add about\add* \nd God¦106399\nd*, they didn't¦106400 honour or thank¦106405 him, but their theories made them incompetent and their minds turned from perception towards darkness.
\v 22 They claimed to be scientific but instead they¦106422 believed foolishness¦106422
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Deu 4:16-18.\x*and \add so\add* they¦106424 changed¦106424 the greatness of the eternal \nd God¦106429\nd* into the likeness¦106431 of an image¦106432 of a mortal¦106433 human¦106434, or birds¦106436 or animals or reptiles¦106440.
\p
\v 24 Therefore¦106441 \nd God¦106446\nd* reluctantly let their lusts lead to impurity¦106454 and the dishonouring¦106456 of their bodies¦106458 among themselves¦106461
\v 25 as they exchanged¦106464 God's truth¦106466 for a lie and now worshipped¦106473 and served the creation, instead of the creator who \add should be\add* praised throughout the ages. May¦106487 it¦106480 be so¦106487.
\p
\v 26 Because¦106488 of that, \nd God¦106493\nd* reluctantly let them exercise their dishonourable¦106496 passions¦106495 and their women exchanged¦106502 natural acts for those against nature,
\v 27 and similarly their men deserted the natural¦106519 acts towards women and stoked their lusts towards each other—man with man and the shame¦106536 that it¦106542 produces¦106537, and then received back in themselves¦106548 the payment which¦106541 is appropriate¦106542 for such deception¦106544.
\p
\v 28 They didn't¦106552 want to know¦106558 about \nd God¦106555\nd* and so he reluctantly let their depraved minds be filled with unhelpful thoughts
\v 29 and so they were filled¦106570 with disobedience, wickedness¦106575, greediness¦106577, and malice, and full of envy, murder¦106581, strife¦106582, and deceit¦106584, \add becoming\add* malicious, gossips¦106586,
\v 30 slanderers¦106587, god-haters¦106588, abusers¦106589, proud¦106590, braggers¦106591, inventors¦106592 of evil¦106593, unable to be persuaded by \add their\add* parents¦106594,
\v 31 unintelligent¦106596, untrustworthy¦106597, unloving¦106598, \add and\add* unmerciful¦106600.
\v 32 They know that \nd God¦106605\nd* must exercise justice towards those doing¦106612 such things, yet they not only practice those things which will lead to a death¦106614 sentence, but they also approve when others do them.

\s1 Judgement even for those without the written law
\rem /s1 The Righteous Judgment of God; God's Righteous Judgment; God's Judgment of Sin
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1: \xt Mat 7:1; Luk 6:37.\x*So¦106627 there's no excuse for anyone who judges others because¦106646 you're condemning¦106644 yourselves¦106643 if you're doing¦106648 those same things that you're judging other for
\v 2 because we¦106651 know that God's judgement¦106656 is based on the factual accounts of what \add each person\add* is doing.
\v 3 But maybe you're¦106668 thinking that you can judge others doing¦106680 these things and yet \add somehow\add* escape¦106684 God's judgement¦106686 when you do them yourself¦106681?
\v 4 Or maybe you're¦106701 \add taking advantage\add* of God's kindness and patience¦106700 without realising that his¦106694 kindness was \add meant\add* to lead you towards repentance¦106709?
\v 5 But it's your¦106716 hardness¦106715 and failure to repent that \add causing\add* severe anger to be stored up for the day of God's judgement¦106731 when \add all\add* will be revealed \add including\add* his severe anger
\v 6 \x + \xo 2:6: \xt Psa 62:12; Prv 24:12.\x*as each person will be \add judged\add* by their actions.
\v 7 Those who've endured¦106744 to do good¦106746 expecting praise and honour¦106749 and to escape destruction, \add will be given\add* eternal¦106754 life¦106753,
\v 8 but those who've \add lived out\add* their selfish¦106758 ambition¦106758 and refused to believe the truth¦106763 but \add let themselves get\add* persuaded¦106764 by disobedience, \add will meet with\add* severe¦106769 anger¦106769 and rage¦106771.
\v 9 For every¦106777 person doing evil¦106783, there will be tribulation and distress¦106775—to Jews first¦106786 and then to non-Jews,
\v 10 but to those who do good¦106799, there'll be praise and honour¦106792 and peace¦106794—to Jews first¦106802 and then to non-Jews
\v 11 \x + \xo 2:11: \xt Deu 10:17.\x*because¦106806 \nd God¦106811\nd* doesn't \add indulge in\add* favouritism¦106808.
\p
\v 12 Those not under the \add Jewish\add* laws and yet sinned, they'll be judged without the law, and those who knew the laws and sinned, will be judged by the law,
\v 13 because¦106828 listening¦106830 to the law doesn't make \add people\add* right¦106833 with \nd God¦106836\nd*, but¦106837 rather it's those who obey the law who will be declared guiltless.
\v 14 Whenever other nations don't have \add Jewish\add* law but naturally¦106850 obey what's in the laws, then even those that don't have \add our\add* laws have their own law.
\v 15 They demonstrate that they effectively have \add God's\add* law written¦106869 in their minds and which matches their consciences¦106877, and between¦106879 the two they'll be either accused¦106883 or defended¦106886
\v 16 on the day¦106889 when \nd God¦106895\nd* through \nd Messiah¦106905 Yeshua¦106906\nd*, judges people's¦106899 private \add lives\add* as I've shared \add as part of\add* the good¦106902 message¦106902.
\s1 Jews who disobey their laws
\rem /s1 The Jews and their law
\p
\v 17 But if you're a Jew¦106912 and trusting in the law and boasting¦106919 about \add being¦106913 chosen by\add* \nd God¦106921\nd*
\v 18 and knowing his will and knowing what's important because of familiarity with the law,
\v 19 and if you've persuaded¦106934 yourself¦106936 that you're a guide¦106937 for the blind¦106939 and a light¦106940 to those who are in darkness¦106943,
\v 20 and that you're an instructor¦106944 to foolish¦106945 people and a teacher¦106946 of children, and that you appear¦106950 to be knowledgeable¦106952 about the truth¦106955 of the law,
\v 21 then why do you teach others when you haven't \add even\add* taught¦106961 yourself¦106963? You announce that stealing is wrong, but you're¦106970 a thief.
\v 22 You teach about not messing with other people's spouses, yet you do it yourself. You detest¦106977 idols¦106979, but you sneak money out of the temple¦106980.
\v 23 You boast¦106984 about \add being a student \add* of the law, but you¦106992 dishonour¦106992 \nd God¦106991\nd* by breaking the laws.
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:24: \xt Isa 52:5 (LXX).\x*\add Yes,\add* it's been written¦107005: ‘God's name¦106995 is slandered¦107000 among¦107001 the nations because¦106998 of you¦106999 all.’
\p
\v 25 Circumcision¦107006 is of value if you're keeping the law, but if you're breaking the laws, then your¦107020 circumcision¦107019 is just the same as if you're uncircumcised¦107021,
\v 26 so if uncircumcised \add peoples\add* act justly according to the law, even though they're not physically circumcised¦107038, \add God\add* will consider them as his¦107036 people.
\v 27 \add Yes, those peoples\add* who are not circumcised but keep the law, will be judging¦107041 you¦107049 who were given the law in writing and¦107053 are circumcised, yet break those laws.
\v 28 A \add true\add* Jew is not just a Jew on the outside, and circumcision¦107072 isn't¦107057 just on the outside of the body¦107071,
\v 29 \x + \xo 2:29: \xt Deu 30:6.\x*but is a Jew¦107078 even in their private life and through circumcision¦107080 of their heart¦107081—by the \nd spirit¦107083\nd* and not by the letter¦107085 of the law—earning praise¦107088 not from people, but from \nd God¦107095\nd*.

\rem /s1 God's Faithfulness; God Remains Faithful
\p
\v 1 So¦107097 what advantage is it in being a Jew¦107101 and what's the benefit¦107105 of circumcision¦107107?
\v 2 A lot in every¦107110 way. Firstly¦107112, Jews were entrusted¦107116 with \add the writing down\add* of God's messages.
\v 3 But what if some didn't believe? Wouldn't the unbelief¦107129 of Jews make faith¦107132 \add that comes from\add* \nd God¦107134\nd* worthless?
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4: \xt Psa 51:4 (LXX).\x*Absolutely not. Even if every¦107143 person¦107145 was a liar, \nd God¦107141\nd* is true just like it's been written¦107149 \add about him\add*:
\q1 ‘You will be proved right about what you say,
\q2 and you'll prevail when you're judged¦107162 \add in court\add*.’
\p
\v 5 But if our¦107168 sinfulness highlights God's sinlessness, what can we¦107173 say about that? \add So\add* isn't God, the one inflicting¦107179 the severe¦107181 anger¦107181, wrong \add to punish us\add*. (Of course this is reasoning from a human¦107184 perspective.)
\v 6 Of course not, otherwise how could \nd God¦107193\nd* be able to judge the world¦107195?
\p
\v 7 But if my lie \add exposes\add* God's truth¦107200 and so brings him honour, why would he still¦107213 judge¦107217 me as a sinner¦107216?
\v 8 Some people falsely accuse us of saying, ‘Let's do evil things so that good might follow.’ Those who say that deserve their¦107239 punishment.
\s1 No person is guiltless
\rem /s1 No One is Righteous; All People Are Sinners
\p
\v 9 What then? Do \add Jews\add* have any advantage¦107245? Definitely not, because¦107250 we¦107249 showed earlier that both Jews and¦107254 other nationalities are all under¦107257 sin's \add shadow\add*
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10-12: \xt Psa 14:1-3 (LXX); Psa 53:1-3 (LXX).\x*just like it¦107261 was written¦107261 long ago:

\p
\v 19 We know that whatever the law says, it's for \add everyone¦107357\add* that the law applies to, so that no one can speak¦107355 against it, and¦107360 the whole world¦107365 will be bound by God's judgement¦107361.
\v 20 \x + \xo 3:20: \xt Psa 143:2; Gal 2:16.\x*No human will be declared guiltless in front of God by their keeping the law, because¦107379 it's the law that teaches what sin¦107382 is.
\s1 Removing the guilt from sin
\rem /s1 Righteousness through Faith; How We Are Put Right with God; Christ Took Our Punishment
\p
\v 21 But now \nd God¦107388\nd* has revealed¦107389 a way to remove guilt that's not by rules—a way that Mosheh and¦107394 the prophets¦107396 wrote about.
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Gal 2:16.\x*We can be made right¦107397 with \nd God¦107399\nd* through¦107400 faith¦107401 in \nd Yeshua¦107403 Messiah¦107404\nd*. This is for \em \+nd everyone¦107404\+nd*\em* who believes¦107413 because¦107415 there's¦107416 no distinction¦107417 \add between Jews and¦107398 others\add*
\v 23 because¦107419 everyone has sinned¦107420 and¦107421 is unable to be honoured by \nd God¦107427\nd*.
\v 24 \add But\add* even without deserving it, we can be declared guiltless by God's grace¦107432 by being¦107428 bought out of slavery \add to sin\add* by \nd Messiah¦107438 Yeshua¦107439\nd*
\v 25 who God placed \add on the altar\add* as a sacrifice for sin. \add This happens¦107462\add* through¦107445 faith¦107447 in his blood¦107452 which was a sign¦107454 of his sinlessness.
\p (God hasn't yet judged those who sinned in the past
\v 26 because of his patience, waiting for the present¦107477 time¦107478 to show his righteousness¦107473 and to be fair, and to remove the guilt of those with faith¦107488 in \nd Yeshua¦107489\nd*.)
\p
\v 27 So¦107491 where¦107490 does that leave boasting¦107493? It's not in the picture. How come? Through¦107495 obeying the \add Mosheh's\add* laws? No, through¦107502 a law about faith¦107504.
\v 28 So¦107507 now we¦107505 should expect that a person¦107511 will be made guiltless by faith¦107510—not by obeying \add Mosheh's\add* laws.
\v 29 Or is God only god of the Jews¦107517? Isn't he also the god of others? Yes, he is the God of others.
\v 30 \x + \xo 3:30: \xt Deu 6:4; Gal 3:20.\x*Indeed, there's only one \nd God¦107533\nd* and he declares people guiltless by faith whether they're circumcised¦107536 Jews, or non-Jews.
\v 31 So¦107545 does this ‘faith¦107549’ cancel the law? Not on your life. In fact, it¦107552 upholds the law.

\p
\v 1 So¦107558 what did our¦107565 physical ancestor, Abraham¦107561 discover about all this?
\v 2 Because¦107570 if Abraham¦107571 was declared guiltless because¦107570 of his actions, maybe he¦107575 could boast¦107576? But not towards¦107579 \nd God¦107581\nd*
\v 3 \x + \xo 4:3: \xt Gen 15:6; Gal 3:6.\x*because¦107583 the scriptures¦107585 say: ‘Abraham¦107589 believed¦107587 in \nd God¦107591\nd* so he was considered guiltless.’
\v 4 Now for someone who's working¦107599, their wages are considered ‘owed’, not a gift.
\v 5 However someone who's not working¦107613 but¦107611 having faith that \add God\add* will declare disobedient people as guiltless, then that person's faith is considered to make them guiltless.
\v 6 It's just like what David¦107637 said about blessing¦107640 a person¦107642 who \nd God¦107645\nd* declares as guiltless despite their actions:
\q1
\v 7 \x + \xo 4:7-8: \xt Psa 32:1-2.\x*‘Those who've been forgiven¦107652 for their lawlessness¦107654 will be happy,
\q2 and whose sins¦107659 have been covered¦107657 over.
\q1
\v 8 Anyone who \nd Yahweh¦107667\nd* declares to have no sin¦107668 will be happy.’
\p
\v 9 Is this favour shown to circumcised¦107675 Jews or is it also for non-Jews? Because¦107683 we¦107682 were saying¦107682 that Abraham¦107687 was considered guiltless because¦107683 of his faith¦107689.
\v 10 So¦107693 how did that happen? Because he was circumcised or when he was \add still\add* uncircumcised? No, it¦107694 was before he was circumcised.
\v 11 \x + \xo 4:11: \xt Gen 17:10.\x*He received¦107709 circumcision¦107710 as a sign¦107708—proof of the righteousness that he gained from his faith¦107716 while he was still uncircumcised—becoming the father¦107725 of everyone who's uncircumcised but believes¦107728 so that they'll be declared guiltless.
\v 12 So our¦107763 ancestor Abraham¦107764 is the ancestor of us as a circumcised people, not just because we're circumcised, but¦107747 also as we follow his steps¦107752 of faith¦107760 while uncircumcised¦107758.

\v 13 \x + \xo 4:13: \xt Gen 17:4-6; 22:17-18; Gal 3:29.\x*It wasn't because of \add his obeying\add* the law that it was promised¦107770 that Abraham¦107772 or his descendants¦107775 would inherit the world¦107782, but¦107783 because of \add his\add* righteousness¦107785 \add that came from his\add* faith¦107786,

\v 16 \x + \xo 4:16: \xt Gal 3:7.\x*Because¦107813 of this, the promise to the descendants is by faith—\add given \add* not only to the ‘descendants of the law’ but also to the ‘descendants of Abraham's faith’. This promise \add is given\add* by grace¦107820 and has been confirmed¦107824,

\v 18 \x + \xo 4:18: \xt Gen 15:5.\x*\add Without any other evidence\add*, he believed¦107875 in hope itself and thus he became the father¦107880 of many nations¦107882 according¦107883 to what he had been told: ‘Your¦107890 descendants¦107889 will be like \add the sand and the stars\add*.’
\v 19 \x + \xo 4:19: \xt Gen 17:17.\x*He didn't¦107892 falter¦107893 in his faith¦107895, seeing that his body¦107900 was already¦107901 infertile being about¦107904 a hundred¦107903 years old and¦107906 with Sarah¦107911 being past menopause,
\v 20 but he didn't¦107918 show unbelief¦107921 and doubt¦107919 God's promise¦107915 when it was given¦107926, but rather he was strengthened¦107923 in his faith¦107925 and praised God,
\v 21 being quite certain that what \add God\add* promises¦107934, he's also able to do.
\v 22 Therefore¦107939 \add his faith\add* was credited to him¦107942 and he was declared guiltless.
\v 23 However that statement wasn't written¦107946 about \add Abraham\add* only,
\v 24 but¦107954 for us also who are also going¦107959 to receive the same credit because¦107956 of our faith in the \add God\add* who brought our \nd master¦107969 Yeshua¦107967\nd* back to life from the dead¦107972

\v 3 Not only that, but we are also boasting¦108032 even though we're still being persecuted, because we know that difficulties produce¦108042 endurance¦108041
\v 4 and endurance¦108045 shows who we really are, and knowing that produces hope,
\v 5 and we're not disgraced¦108055 by that hope because¦108056 God's love¦108058 has been poured¦108061 out into our¦108066 hearts¦108064 through¦108067 the holy \nd spirit¦108068\nd* who has been given¦108071 to us.

\s1 Death through Adam but life through Yeshua
\rem /s1 Adam and Christ Contrasted; Death Through Adam, Life Through Christ
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 5:12: \xt Gen 3:6.\x*Sin came into the world¦108189 through¦108204 one man, and death came as a result of sin, so death spread to everyone because¦108205 everyone has disobeyed God.
\v 13 Sin was in the world¦108216 before \add Mosheh's\add* law, but¦108218 it wasn't being charged against them, because¦108210 the law had not yet \add been given\add*.
\v 14 But death¦108230 reigned¦108228 from \add the time of\add* Adam until¦108233 \add the time of\add* Mosheh, even over those who didn't¦108238 sin in the way that Adam did—Adam\f + \fr 5:14 \ft Adam is called ‘the son of God’ in Luke 3:38.\f* who was a pattern¦108249 of the \add messiah\add* who would \add eventually\add* come.
\p
\v 15 But the gift is not like the disobedience, because¦108262 if the disobedience of one man introduced death for many, God's grace and the gift that comes from that grace is much more. That gift is the one man \nd Yeshua¦108286 Messiah¦108287\nd* who has been given to very many \add people\add*.
\v 16 It only took one man who disobeyed \add to lead to\add* condemnation¦108308, and one act of disobedience \add to lead to\add* judgement¦108304, but the gift is to bring guiltlessness despite \em many\em* acts of disobedience.
\v 17 Because¦108318 if the disobedience of one man led to death¦108326 reigning \add over us\add* through that one man, how much more will the ones receiving¦108346 an abundance¦108335 of grace¦108338 and the gift¦108341 of righteousness¦108345 be reigning in life¦108348 through the one man \nd Yeshua¦108354 Messiah¦108355\nd*.
\p
\v 18 So¦108357 just as one act of disobedience \add led\add* all people to condemnation¦108367, so also one action \add brought\add* all people to guiltlessness \add and hence to\add* life¦108378.
\v 19 The disobedience¦108383 of one man caused many people to be made sinners¦108387, so also the obedience¦108397 of one man caused many people to be made guiltless.
\p
\v 20 The law was inserted so that acts of disobedience would be plentiful, but¦108413 where¦108412 sin¦108416 has been plentiful, grace¦108419 has overflowed¦108417
\v 21 so that just as sin¦108424 reigned in death¦108427, so also grace¦108431 now reigns through righteousness¦108435, \add leading to\add* eternal¦108438 life¦108437 through our¦108445 \nd master¦108444 Yeshua¦108441 Messiah¦108442\nd*.

\v 2 Not on your life! We who died¦108461 to sin¦108463, how could we \add go back\add* to living¦108466 in it?
\v 3 Or didn't¦108472 you all realise that when we were immersed into \nd Messiah¦108478 Yeshua¦108479\nd*, we were immersed into his¦108483 death¦108482?
\v 4 \x + \xo 6:4: \xt Col 2:12.\x*Therefore¦108486 we were buried¦108485 with him through¦108488 the immersion¦108490 into death¦108493, so that just as \nd Messiah¦108497\nd* was brought back to life by the father's¦108504 power, so too we can walk in newness¦108509 of life.
\v 5 If we have joined together¦108514 in the likeness¦108517 of his¦108520 death¦108519, then we will also be \add joined\add* in the resurrection¦108524,

\v 7 because¦108549 the personality that's died¦108550 has been declared free from sin¦108554.
\v 8 So¦108557 if we died¦108558 with \nd Messiah¦108560\nd*, we also believe¦108561 that we will live with him¦108565,
\v 9 knowing¦108566 that now that \nd Messiah¦108568\nd* has come back to life from the dead¦108571, he won't die again—death¦108574 has no more power over him¦108575.
\v 10 When he died, he died to sin¦108582 once and for all, but now that he lives, he lives to \add please\add* \nd God¦108590\nd*.
\v 11 So too, you¦108593 should be considering yourselves¦108595 dead¦108597 to sin¦108601, and at the same time, alive to \nd God¦108605\nd* in \nd Messiah¦108607 Yeshua¦108608\nd*.
\p
\v 12 So¦108613 therefore don't¦108612 let sin¦108616 be reigning¦108614 in your¦108620 mortal¦108619 bodies in such a way that you're submitting¦108624 to its¦108629 lusts¦108628.
\v 13 Don't be using any parts of your bodies to sin¦108639 as if they're weapons of disobedience, but instead present¦108632 yourselves¦108642 to God as if you came back to life from the dead¦108648, and use all your body parts for God as if they're weapons of righteousness¦108656
\v 14 so that sin¦108659 won't¦108663 be taking control of you—because¦108666 you're not under law but under grace¦108672.

\p
\v 1 So now those who are in \nd Messiah¦109329 Yeshua¦109330\nd* cannot be condemned¦109326
\v 2 because¦109339 the law of the \nd spirit¦109342\nd* of life¦109344 in him freed¦109348 you¦109349 from the law of sin¦109355 and¦109356 death¦109358.
\v 3 The law was powerless¦109361 in that it was faltering¦109366 through¦109367 our bodies. \nd God¦109371\nd* sent his son in a body¦109369 just like our sinful bodies, and concerning¦109382 sin, he condemned¦109384 sin \add itself\add* in the flesh
\v 4 so that for those of us who were no longer living according to the flesh¦109401 but¦109403 according to the \nd spirit¦109405\nd*, then the just act of the law would be fulfilled¦109395 in us.
\v 5 People who live according to their physical desires, think about physical things, but those who live according to the spirit, think about spiritual things.
\v 6 The worldly mindset \add leads to\add* death¦109427, but¦109429 the \nd spiritual¦109432\nd* mindset \add leads to\add* life¦109433 and¦109434 peace¦109435.
\v 7 The worldly mindset¦109438 is making God your enemy because it's not being¦109450 subjected¦109450 to God's law, in fact it's not even able to,
\v 8 and those who are worldly aren't¦109461 able to bring¦109460 pleasure¦109460 to \nd God¦109459\nd*.
\p
\v 9 And all of you aren't¦109465 worldly, but in the spirit, if indeed¦109472 God's spirit is living¦109475 in you, but anyone¦109480 who doesn't have the spirit of \nd Messiah¦109482\nd*, doesn't belong to him.
\v 10 But if \nd Messiah¦109491\nd* is in you¦109493, while your body¦109496 is dead¦109497 because of sin¦109499, your \nd spirit¦109502\nd* has life¦109503 because it's \add been declared\add* guiltless.
\v 11 \x + \xo 8:11: \xt 1Cor 3:16.\x*\add Yes,\add* if the spirit of the one who brought Yeshua back to life is living in you, then the one who brought \nd Messiah¦109525\nd* Yeshua back to life will also give life to your¦109533 mortal¦109531 bodies¦109532 by means of his¦109539 spirit living inside you all.
\p
\v 12 So¦109546 then brothers¦109547 and¦109547 sisters¦109547, we don't¦109550 owe anything to our sinful natures, nor do we need worldly living¦109556.
\v 13 If you all live according¦109559 to the sinful nature, you'll die, but if you put bodily practices¦109568 to death¦109571 with \add the help of the\add* \nd spirit¦109566\nd*, you'll live,
\v 14 because¦109574 all those who are led by God's \nd spirit¦109575\nd* \add become\add* God's children.
\v 15 \x + \xo 8:15-17: \xt Gal 4:5-7.\x*You didn't¦109584 receive a spirit of slavery¦109588 to fear again¦109589, but \add rather\add* it was the spirit of adoption¦109595 as children that you all received, and \add with his help\add* we call out, ‘Father, father.’
\v 16 \add God's\add* spirit himself agrees together with our¦109608 spirit that we are God's children¦109611,
\v 17 and if we're \add his\add* children¦109615, then we're also heirs so we'll receive an inheritance from \nd God¦109620\nd*. That makes us fellow-heirs¦109621 along with \nd Messiah¦109623\nd*—if we're suffering¦109626 with him then we'll also be honoured along with him.

\v 18 I'm sure that any sufferings¦109638 \add we experience\add* in the present¦109640 \add age\add* are nothing in comparison with the coming splendour that's going¦109644 to be revealed¦109646 to us
\v 19 because¦109650 \add all of\add* creation¦109653 is eagerly¦109651 expecting¦109651 and waiting¦109660 for God's children to be revealed.
\v 20 \x + \xo 8:20: \xt Gen 3:17-19.\x*\add Yes,\add* all of creation¦109665 has been subjected to lack of purpose, not willingly¦109668 but because¦109670 it was decided by the one who subjected it, but \add it remains with\add* the hope
\v 21 that it too will be freed from the slavery¦109686 of corruption¦109688 and then \add released\add* into the freedom of the splendour of God's children¦109695,
\v 22 because¦109700 we're aware that all of creation¦109704 is groaning¦109705 and¦109706 suffering\f + \fr 8:22 \ft The word picture here is one of childbirth.\f* along with us right through to the present time¦109709.

\v 24 because we¦109739 were saved¦109739 having hope, but¦109741 if you can see it then it's not hope, because you don't¦109743 need to hope for something that you can \add already\add* see.
\v 25 So we hope for what we can't¦109757 \add yet\add* see and \add so\add* we have to patiently keep waiting¦109762.
\p
\v 26 Similarly the spirit also helps \add us\add* with our¦109773 weaknesses¦109772, because¦109775 we don't¦109781 \add even\add* know what to pray for, but the spirit intercedes¦109787 with groanings¦109790 that we can't¦109781 put into words.
\v 27 The one who searches¦109794 our hearts¦109796 knows the mindset¦109800 of the spirit because¦109803 the spirit intercedes for the believers as \nd God¦109805\nd* desires.

\v 29 Because¦109828 those he foreknew¦109830, he also predetermined¦109832 \add to be\add* similar¦109833 to his son's image¦109835, so that \add his son\add* would become the eldest of many siblings.
\v 30 The ones he'd predetermined¦109851 he also called, and the ones he'd called, he also declared guiltless, and the ones declared guiltless, he also honoured \add in heaven\add*.

\v 31 So¦109870 then, what can we¦109871 say about all this? If \nd God¦109876\nd* is for us, who is against¦109880 us?
\v 32 If he didn't¦109887 spare¦109888 his own son but gave¦109893 him \add to be executed\add* for us, won't¦109887 the two of them also give us everything else?
\v 33 Who will bring charges against¦109908 those chosen¦109909 by God? God is the one declaring \add us\add* guiltless.
\v 34 So who's the one condemning¦109916 \add us\add*? \nd Messiah¦109920 Yeshua¦109921\nd* (the one who died¦109923 but¦109925 came back to life and who's now \add sitting\add* beside \nd God¦109936\nd*) is also pleading¦109939 \em for\em* us.
\v 35 Who will separate¦109945 us from Messiah's love¦109949? Tribulation¦109957 or distress¦109959 or persecution¦109961 or famine¦109963 or poverty or danger¦109967 or execution?

\p
\v 1 Therefore¦110993 I'm asking¦110992: Did \nd God¦110997\nd* push his¦111002 \add chosen\add* people¦111000 away? May it¦111006 never be, because¦111008 I also am an Israeli¦111010, a descendant of Abraham¦111015 in the tribe¦111016 of Benyamin.\x + \xo 11:1: \xt Php 3:5.\x*
\v 2 \add No,\add* God didn't¦111028 push away his¦111024 people¦111023 that he knew before \add he chose them\add*. Or don't¦111028 you know what Eliyyah wrote when he pleaded¦111037 with God to deal with Israel¦111042:\x + \xo 11:2-3: \xt 1Ki 19:10,14.\x*
\v 3 ‘\nd Yahweh¦111044\nd*, they killed¦111048 your prophets¦111046 and tore down your altars¦111051, and I was left alone¦111056 and now they want to kill me!’
\v 4 But what was the revelation¦111067 that was given to him¦111065:\x + \xo 11:4: \xt 1Ki 19:18.\x* ‘I've kept aside seven¦111070 thousand¦111070 others who haven't worshipped Baal¦111077.’
\v 5 So¦111079 too also at the present¦111083 time¦111084, there's a small proportion who've been chosen by \add God's\add* grace¦111088.
\v 6 So if it's by grace, then it's no longer by their actions, otherwise¦111098 the grace wouldn't be grace \add at all\add*.
\p
\v 7 What's¦111120 \add the conclusion\add* then? The Israelis didn't¦111126 find what they were looking¦111121 for¦111121. Only the chosen ones reaching it and the rest were hardened¦111135

\v 14 hoping that somehow¦111252 I might make my¦111254 fellow Jews envious and¦111257 might save¦111258 some of them.
\v 15 Because¦111263 if their rejection¦111266 \add of the messiah\add* meant that \add the rest of\add* the world¦111269 would be reconciled¦111268, what else could their acceptance¦111273 bring other than \add coming back to\add* life¦111276 from the dead¦111278.

\v 16 If the first¦111283 portion \add of dough\add* is holy, so is the lump, and¦111288 if the root is holy, so are the branches¦111295.
\v 17 But if some of the branches¦111300 were broken¦111301 off, and you \add non-Jews\add* who are like a wild, olive tree were grafted into them and so you too were able to share in the growth of the olive tree that was \add sourced\add* in the root,
\v 18 then don't¦111319 brag that you're better than the branches¦111322. If you must boast, remember that you're not supporting the root, but¦111324 the root is supporting you.
\p
\v 19 \add Ah,\add* but then you'll say, ‘Branches were broken¦111339 off so that we could be grafted in.’
\v 20 \add Well\add* you're right. They were broken¦111349 off because of their¦111346 unbelief¦111347, and \add it's true\add* that you're there because of your faith¦111353. But don't get a big head—maintain your reverence \add for God\add*,
\v 21 because¦111363 if he didn't¦111371 spare the natural¦111368 branches¦111370 \add when they showed unbelief\add*, then he won't¦111371 spare you either.
\v 22 So¦111379 you can both God's kindness and his severity: those who disobeyed \add experienced\add* his severity but you \add experienced\add* his kindness. Otherwise you also will be pruned off,
\v 23 and also if they turn from their unbelief¦111417, they'll be grafted \add back\add* in, because¦111420 \nd God¦111423\nd* has the power¦111419 to do that.
\v 24 If were cut off an olive tree that's \em wild\em* by nature, and contrary¦111438 to normal practice were grafted into a \em cultivated¦111442\em* olive tree, how much more would those who naturally belong be grafted into their¦111450 own olive tree!

\v 14 My¦113011 brothers¦113010 and sisters¦113010, I've also been persuaded¦113008 about you myself¦113013, that having¦113024 been filled¦113024 with knowledge¦113027, you're also full of goodness¦113023 and able to rebuke each other.
\v 15 But I wrote¦113036 to you more boldly¦113033, partly to remind¦113045 you all because¦113047 of the grace¦113049 given¦113051 to me by \nd God¦113056\nd*
\v 16 so that I'd be a minister¦113062 to the non-Jews for \nd Messiah¦113063 Yeshua¦113064\nd*, sharing God's good¦113071 message¦113071 so that the offering¦113079 of the non-Jews would be acceptable¦113082 \add to him\add*, having¦113083 been purified by the holy \nd spirit¦113085\nd*. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
\v 17 Therefore¦113089 I'm boasting¦113091 in \nd Messiah¦113093 Yeshua¦113094\nd* about things \add to do with\add* \nd God¦113098\nd*.
\v 18 I wouldn't dare to speak¦113106 about anything¦113104 that wasn't done through¦113111 me by \nd Messiah¦113110\nd*, that led to the obedience¦113116 of non-Jews¦113117 by \add my\add* message¦113118 and¦113119 \add by my\add* working
\v 19 powerful miracles and amazing things in the power of God's \nd spirit¦113130\nd*, so that from Yerushalem¦113136 all the way around¦113138 to Illyricum¦113141, I've obeyed the Messiah's good message¦113144.
\v 20 I was enthusiastic to be preaching¦113151 the good¦113151 message¦113151 wherever¦113153 \nd Messiah¦113156\nd* wasn't known about so that I wouldn't be building¦113162 on other's foundations¦113161,

\v 27 \x + \xo 15:27: \xt 1Cor 9:11.\x*They took pleasure¦113269 \add but\add* they're also in debt to them, because¦113279 if the non-Jews¦113285 have shared¦113283 in \add Jewish\add* spiritual¦113281 things, then they should also minister¦113291 to them with material¦113290 things.
