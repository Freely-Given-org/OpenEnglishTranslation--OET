\mt2 The letter to the
\mt1 Hebrews
\is1 Introduction
\ip It's not known who wrote this letter, but it was sent to a group of Jewish believers. It was written so that their faith would be strengthened because they were in danger of losing their faith due to their sufferings. So then, the writer encouraged them concerning their faith and taught them that Yeshua is the true messiah and God's final revelation.
\ip These three truth were carefully taught: (1) Yeshua/Jesus who had no beginning and has no ending is God's son and he's greater than any or all of the prophets, or messengers, or even Mosheh/Moses. (2) Yeshua has been revealed by God as the final priest, greater than any priest in the Hebrew scriptures. (3) By means of Yeshua, those who believe in him can be saved from sin and death.
\ip The faith of famous Hebrews from long ago is written about in chapter 11. So then, the writer encourages the believers to strengthen of their faith. And in chapter 12, he encourages them again to continue their walk until the end when we all see Yeshua. They need to continue despite any persecution and discouragements that come to them. But it's necessary to know that God disciplines them all as his own children. He finishes this letter with his advice and his warning.

\p
\v 1 Long ago, \nd God¦140965\nd* spoke¦140966 to \add our\add* ancestors¦140968 through the prophets¦140972 in many different circumstances and in many different ways,
\v 2 but in these¦140978 last days¦140977 he spoke¦140979 to us through \add his\add* son who he appointed¦140984 to inherit everything. It was also through him that he made the different eras—
\v 3 \add through the son\add* who radiates¦140996 \add the father's\add* splendour and represents¦141000 his reality¦141002. \add The son\add* bears everything by the message¦141010 of his power¦141012, and after having¦141022 made \add a way to be\add* purified¦141017 from our sins¦141020, he sat¦141023 down in heaven next to God in the seat of the second-in-command.
\s1 The son is greater than the angels
\rem /s1 The Greatness of God's Son; Christ Is Greater Than the Angels
\p
\v 4 By having¦141033 become¦141033 so much better¦141032 than \add God's\add* messengers¦141035, he inherited¦141040 a greater reputation than them,
\rem /s1 The Son Is Superior to Angels
\v 5 because¦141043 which¦141042 of the messengers¦141047 was told \add even\add* once \add by God\add*:\x + \xo 1:5: a \xt Psa 2:7; \xo b \xt 2Sam 7:14; 1Ch 17:13.\x*
\q1 ‘You are my¦141049 son;
\q1 I gave birth to you today¦141053.’
\m And again:
\q1 ‘I will be a father¦141062 to him,
\q1 And he will be a son to me.’
\m
\v 6 Then¦141070 when \add @God\add* \add again¦141071\add* brings¦141073 his firstborn¦141075 \add son\add* into the world¦141078 he said:\x + \xo 1:6: \xt Deu 32:43 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Let all of God's messengers¦141084 bow down to him.’
\m
\v 7 On one hand¦141088 he said to \add his\add* messengers:\x + \xo 1:7: \xt Psa 104:4 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘The \add one\add* making his messengers winds,
\q2 and¦141086 \add making\add* his ministers¦141100 a fiery flame¦141103.’
\m
\v 8 And on the other¦141105 hand¦141105 to \add his\add* son he said:\x + \xo 1:8-9: \xt Psa 45:6-7.\x*
\q1 ‘\nd God¦141112\nd*, your¦141110 throne¦141109 \add will last\add* to the end of the ages;
\q1 The ruler of his kingdom¦141126 is a ruler of justice.
\q1
\v 9 You loved¦141129 righteousness¦141130 and hated¦141132 lawlessness¦141134,

\q2 with gladness beyond¦141147 \add what\add* your companions¦141149 \add received\add*.’
\m
\v 10 He also said \add to his son\add*:\x + \xo 1:10-12: \xt Psa 102:25-27 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘\nd Yahweh¦141155\nd*, at the beginning¦141154 you established¦141158 the earth¦141157,
\q1 and¦141151 you made the heavens¦141166 with your¦141163 hands¦141162.
\q1
\v 11 They will perish¦141168 but¦141170 you¦141169 will continue¦141171;

\q1 But you \add remain\add* the same¦141191,
\q1 and you won't¦141197 get old and fragile.’
\m
\v 13 To which¦141200 of \add his\add* messengers¦141203 did God say even once:\x + \xo 1:13: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*
\q1 ‘Sit \add in the seat of honour\add* on my right¦141208,

\s1 The truth about salvation
\rem /s1 A Warning against Drifting Away; Warning to Pay Attention; The Great Salvation
\p
\v 1 Because¦141234 of that, it's much more appropriate¦141236 for us to listen carefully to the \add message\add* so we¦141246 don't drift¦141246 away.
\v 2 Because¦141248 if the message¦141253 that was brought by the messengers¦141251 is confirmed¦141255 and \add so\add* every¦141257 transgression¦141258 and \add act of\add* disobedience¦141260 received¦141261 the appropriate penalty¦141263,
\v 3 how will \em we\em* escape¦141266 \add punishment\add* if we neglect¦141269 such a great¦141268 \add offer of\add* salvation. This salvation was first heard when spoken¦141274 about by the \nd master¦141277\nd* and then others who heard confirmed¦141283 it to us
\v 4 and \nd God¦141288\nd* testified¦141285 it by means of sign and wonders¦141292 and various¦141294 miracles¦141295 and by gifts of the holy \nd spirit¦141297\nd* whenever he wanted.

\rem /s1 Jesus Made Like His Brothers; Exaltation through Abasement; Jesus, the Man; The One Who Leads Us to Salvation
\p
\v 5 It's not \add his\add* messengers¦141307 that \add God\add* put in charge of the future world¦141312 that we're talking¦141317 about,
\v 6 but¦141319 someone¦141321 testified¦141318 somewhere¦141320 saying¦141322:\x + \xo 2:6-8: \xt Psa 8:4-6.\x*
\q1 ‘What is humankind that you think about him,
\q1 or humanity's son that you notice¦141334 him?
\q1
\v 7 You made him a little¦141338 less than \add your\add* messengers¦141342.
\q1 You crowned¦141346 him with splendour and honour¦141345.
\q1
\v 8 You put everything under his authority.’
\m By putting everything under his authority, nothing¦141372 is left that he doesn't control, although \add right\add* now we don't¦141379 see everything being under his authority yet.
\v 9 But although he was made a little¦141387 lower than \add God's\add* messengers¦141390, we see \nd Yeshua\nd* have suffered¦141396 death, \add now\add* crowned¦141402 with splendour and honour¦141401, so that by God's grace¦141405, he experienced death for everyone¦141408.
\v 10 It was appropriate for him, the one who everything was made for and who made everything, having¦141427 brought¦141427 many children to be with God and being the originator¦141429 of their¦141432 salvation¦141431, to become perfect¦141435 through¦141433 what he suffered¦141434.
\p
\v 11 Both the person who is making people holy and the ones being made holy are \add part of\add* one \add family\add* because¦141446 he's not ashamed¦141450 to call them brothers¦141451 and sisters¦141451
\v 12 saying¦141454:\x + \xo 2:12: \xt Psa 22:22.\x*
\q1 ‘I will announce your¦141458 name¦141457 to my¦141461 brothers¦141460,
\q1 I will sing praise songs to you from the middle of the assembly¦141464.’
\m
\v 13 And also:\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Isa 8:17 (LXX)\x*
\q1 ‘I will trust¦141471 \add myself\add* to him¦141473.’
\m And:\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Isa 8:18.\x*
\q1 ‘Look¦141476, it's me with the little¦141480 children¦141480 that \nd God¦141485\nd* gave¦141483 me.’
\p
\v 14 So¦141487 because¦141486 the ‘little¦141489 children¦141489’ are \add all made of\add* flesh¦141494 and blood¦141491, he also \add became a man\add* to be just like them, so that through¦141503 his death, he could nullify¦141506 the power¦141509 of death (which \add comes from\add* the devil¦141516)
\v 15 and¦141517 set free all those who in a lifetime ‘slavery¦141530’ \add controlled\add* by the fear¦141522 of death¦141523.
\v 16 You can be certain that it's not \add God's\add* messengers¦141534 that he's helped, but¦141536 rather Abraham's descendants.\x + \xo 2:16: \xt Isa 41:8-9.\x*
\v 17 That's why he had to be just like his brothers¦141545 and sisters¦141545, so that he could become¦141549 \add the\add* merciful¦141548 and faithful¦141551 chief¦141552 priest¦141552 \add representing\add* \nd God¦141556\nd*, in order to pay the price for the people's¦141565 sins¦141562.
\v 18 Because he also suffered¦141569 when he was tempted \add to sin\add*, he's able to help¦141575 others who are tempted.

\p
\v 1 Therefore, godly brothers¦141577 and sisters¦141577, who \add share in\add* the heavenly¦141580 calling¦141579, consider \nd Yeshua\nd*, who we acknowledge as our¦141589 missionary and high priest¦141586,
\v 2 how he was faithful to \add God\add* who appointed him, just as Mosheh was faithful in God's house¦141604.\x + \xo 3:2: \xt Num 12:7.\x*
\v 3 \add Yeshua\add* was considered¦141613 worthy¦141613 of more honour than Mosheh, just like the builder of a house is honoured more than the house itself¦141622,
\v 4 because¦141628 every house¦141629 is made by someone¦141632, but¦141634 the one who made everything is \nd God¦141640\nd*.
\v 5 On one hand¦141644, Mosheh was faithful¦141645 in all of his¦141650 house¦141649, thus serving as a testimony¦141654 for what was yet to be told,
\v 6 and on the other¦141658 hand¦141658, \nd Messiah¦141657\nd* was \add the\add* son over his¦141664 house, which is us if we retain¦141684 our confidence¦141675 and the expectation of our hope.

\q1 ‘Today¦141692 if you¦141698 hear¦141698 his¦141697 voice¦141695,
\q1
\v 8 don't¦141699 harden¦141700 your¦141703 hearts¦141702 as \add you did\add* in the rebellion¦141708,

\q1 although they¦141729 saw¦141729 my¦141732 actions
\v 10 over forty¦141733 years¦141734.
\m That's why I was angry¦141736 with that generation¦141738 and I said:
\q1 ‘They're always straying¦141744 in their¦141746 hearts¦141747 and they don't¦141752 \add really\add* know my¦141756 ways.’
\m
\v 11 As I decided in my severe¦141761 anger¦141761:
\q1 ‘They will never be entering into my peace.’
\p
\v 12 Brothers¦141770 and sisters, watch¦141769 out in case any of you has an evil¦141777 heart¦141776 with unbelief¦141778 \add which leads you\add* to withdraw¦141781 from the living¦141784 \nd God¦141783\nd*.
\v 13 Instead urge yourselves¦141788 \add on\add* throughout¦141789 each day (while it's still called¦141796 ‘today¦141795’) so that¦141793 some of you won't¦141798 become hardened¦141799 by the sin's seduction¦141804
\v 14 because¦141810 we are now partakers¦141809 of the \nd messiah¦141813\nd* if we can retain¦141824 until¦141821 the end¦141822 the assurance¦141819 that we had at the beginning¦141817.
\v 15 As it's been said¦141827:\x + \xo 3:15: \xt Psa 95:7-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Today¦141828 if you all hear¦141833 his¦141832 voice¦141831,

\v 17 Who was he angry¦141859 with for forty¦141860 years¦141861? Wasn't it the people who disobeyed God and¦141857 who died there in the wilderness¦141872?
\v 18 And who did God promise that they wouldn't enter his¦141881 rest, if it wasn't the people who disbelieved¦141886?
\v 19 So¦141887 we¦141888 can \add now\add* see that they¦141891 weren't able to enter \add the promised land\add* because¦141893 of their unbelief¦141894.

\s1 Entering God's rest/peace
\rem /s1 Promised Rest for God's People; The Rest That God Promised; A Sabbath-Rest for the People of God
\p
\v 1 That's why we might be afraid¦141895: because although we had a promise¦141899 to enter his¦141904 rest, some of you¦141908 might fail to achieve it,
\v 2 because we've already had the good message preached¦141914 \add to us\add* just like them, but the message they heard¦141931 didn't¦141918 benefit¦141919 them because they weren't united¦141926 in faith¦141929 with the \add others\add* who listened.
\v 3 So those of us who believed¦141940 are entering that rest, as he said¦141942:\x + \xo 4:3: \xt Psa 95:11.\x*
\q1 ‘As I promised in my severe¦141947 anger¦141947,
\q1 They will never enter into my rest.’
\m And yet he's had it \add ready\add* since the creation of the world¦141960.
\v 4 Because¦141963 somewhere¦141964 he's spoken¦141962 about the seventh \add day saying\add*:\x + \xo 4:4: \xt Gen 2:2.\x*
\q1 ‘And on the seventh day \nd God¦141972\nd* rested¦141970 from all his¦141982 works¦141981.’
\m
\v 5 And also:\x + \xo 4:5: \xt Psa 95:11.\x*
\q1 ‘They will never enter my¦141992 rest.’
\m
\v 6 Therefore¦141994 because it's being¦141995 retained¦141995 for some people to \add still\add* come into it, and those who previously¦142002 had the good message¦142003 preached¦142003 to them didn't¦142004 come in because of \add their\add* disbelief¦142008,
\v 7 \add God\add* designated¦142011 a certain¦142010 day saying¦142017:\x + \xo 4:7: \xt Psa 95:7-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Today¦142025 if you all hear his¦142029 voice¦142028,
\q1 Don't harden¦142032 your¦142035 hearts¦142034.’
\p
\v 8 Because¦142037 if Yoshua¦142039 had given them rest,\x + \xo 4:8: \xt Deu 31:7; Josh 22:4.\x* \add God\add* wouldn't¦142043 be speaking¦142046 afterwards¦142047 about¦142044 another¦142045 day¦142050.
\v 9 So then, a time of rest is being¦142053 retained¦142053 for God's people¦142056,
\v 10 because¦142060 anyone having¦142061 come¦142061 into their rest, also rests from their works, just as \nd God¦142078\nd* rested¦142068 from his¦142065 own works.\x + \xo 4:10: \xt Gen 2:2.\x*
\v 11 Therefore¦142080 we¦142079 should be earnest¦142079 about entering that rest, in case someone¦142091 else falls \add by following our\add* example¦142092 of disbelief¦142096,
\v 12 because¦142099 God's message¦142101 is living¦142097 and active¦142105 and sharper¦142107 than any high-quality sword¦142110, even penetrating¦142113 to divide the soul¦142116 and spirit¦142119—\add like\add* separating the bone from sinews—and able to judge¦142125 a person's inner thoughts¦142126 and intentions¦142129.
\v 13 There isn't anything in all of creation¦142134 that's hidden¦142135 from him, but everything is naked¦142140 and¦142131 exposed¦142142 to his¦142145 sight \add as\add* he's the one we have to give an account¦142150 to.

\v 15 because¦142169 we don't¦142168 have a high priest¦142171 who's not able to sympathise¦142174 with our¦142177 weakness¦142176, but rather who's been tempted¦142178 just like we are, yet he didn't¦142168 sin¦142185.
\v 16 Therefore¦142187 we can boldly approach¦142186 the throne¦142191 of grace to receive¦142195 mercy¦142197 and find grace to help us when we need it.

\c 7
\s1 Melchizedek, the special priest
\rem /s1 Melchizedek Is Compared to Abraham; The Priest Melchizedek; The Priestly Order of Melchizedek; Melchizedek the Priest
\p
\v 1 This Melchizedek was the king¦142778 of \add the city of\add* Salem¦142780 and a priest¦142781 of \nd God¦142783\nd*, the highest¦142785 one.\x + \xo 7:1-2: \xt Gen 14:17-20.\x* He met Abraham¦142790 who was returning¦142791 from slaughtering¦142794 \add several\add* kings¦142796 and Melchizedek blessed¦142798 him¦142799,
\v 2 and Abraham¦142809 gave him a tenth¦142802 of all the captured goods. \add The name Melchizedek\add* means ‘king of righteousness¦142814’ and then king of Salem¦142820 also means ‘king of peace¦142825’.
\v 3 \add There's no record of his\add* father¦142826 or mother¦142827, no genealogical¦142828 background, and no \add record of his\add* being born or dying, but he's likened¦142836 to God's son in that he continually¦142846 remains¦142842 as a priest¦142843.
\p
\v 4 Notice how great¦142849 this Melchizedek was, \add because\add* the patriarch¦142861 Abraham¦142854 gave¦142855 him a tenth¦142853 of the best of the captured goods.
\v 5 On one hand¦142864, the tithing¦142874 command¦142872 from \add Mosheh's\add* law makes the people¦142876 give a tenth to Levi's descendants who inherit the priestly¦142870 office¦142870, even though they're their¦142884 brothers¦142883 as \add fellow\add* descendants of Abraham¦142890.\x + \xo 7:5: \xt Num 18:21.\x*
\v 6 On the other¦142892 hand¦142892, Abraham tithed¦142897 to Melchizedek who can't¦142893 be traced¦142894 as one of them, and he blessed¦142905 Abraham who had received \add God's\add* promises¦142904.
\v 7 There's no doubt that it's the lessor¦142912 \add person\add* that gets blessed¦142916 by \add someone\add* greater.
\v 8 So¦142917 in the first case, the tenth is received¦142923 by people¦142922 who die, but in the second case by someone who it's \add only\add* testified that he lives.
\v 9 You could even say¦142932 that even Levi¦142937 (whose descendants receive¦142940 the tenths) gave a tenth \add to Melchizedek\add* through¦142934 Abraham¦142935
\v 10 because¦142943 Levi's \add sperm\add* was still¦142942 part of his father's¦142948 body when Melchizedek met Abraham.
\s1 Yeshua, the priest like Melchizedek
\rem /s1 Jesus Like Melchizedek; Another Priest, Like Melchizedek
\p
\v 11 Indeed if perfection¦142958 came from the priesthood from Levi's tribe¦142961 which was legislated¦142971 \add to help\add* the people¦142965, why would there¦142957 have still¦142973 been a need for another¦142979 to rise up as a priest¦142981 in the order of Melchizedek and¦142982 not \add just\add* from the order of Aaron¦142987?
\v 12 Because¦142990 if the priesthood¦142992 is changed, then \add that\add* law would also need to be changed.
\v 13 The one that we're talking about here is from another¦143007 tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served¦143013 \add as a priest\add* at the altar¦143016.
\p
\v 14 So it's quite¦143017 evident¦143017 that our¦143025 \nd master¦143024\nd* came from Judah's tribe but Mosheh never mentioned priests¦143031 coming from that tribe,
\rem /s1 Christ Is like Melchizedek; Another Priest, like Melchizedek
\v 15 and¦143037 it's even more clear if another¦143050 priest¦143049 like Melchizedek¦143046 rose up
\v 16 who didn't¦143052 live by the physical law \add (of death)\add* but¦143060 according to the power¦143062 of indestructible¦143064 life¦143063!
\v 17 Because¦143067 it's been testified¦143066:\x + \xo 7:17: \xt Psa 110:4.\x*
\q1 ‘You are priest¦143071 to this age,
\q1 according¦143075 to the order¦143077 of Melchizedek.’
\m
\v 18 In the first case, the command¦143084 is annulled¦143079 because¦143085 it's weak and unprofitable¦143090
\v 19 (because the law made nothing¦143092 perfect¦143094), and in the second case we have the introduction¦143097 of a better¦143099 hope by means of which¦143102 we can approach \nd God¦143106\nd*.
\p
\v 20 And it wasn't done without an oath, because although \add men\add* become¦143122 priests¦143121 without an oath,
\v 21 but \add Yeshua became a priest\add* by an oath from the one that said:\x + \xo 7:21: \xt Psa 110:4.\x*
\q1 ‘\nd Yahweh¦143133\nd* made an oath
\q2 and won't¦143135 rescind it.
\q1 You are priest for this age.’
\m
\v 22 Because of that oath, \nd Yeshua\nd* became the guarantor¦143155 of a better¦143152 agreement.
\p
\v 23 in the first case, there have been many of those priests¦143163 because¦143165 death¦143167 doesn't allow them to continue¦143169 on,
\v 24 but in the second case, because¦143172 \add Yeshua\add* stays alive for \add all\add* the age, he can hold the office of priest¦143182 permanently¦143179
\v 25 and thus he's able to save those who approach¦143192 \nd God¦143196\nd* through¦143193 him—save them to the full extent¦143189 because he always¦143197 lives to intercede of their behalf.
\p
\v 26 Such a high priest¦143209 exactly meets our needs: one who is godly¦143210, innocent¦143211, pure, set apart from sinners¦143217, and¦143218 honoured above the heavens¦143221.
\v 27 Unlike the \add other\add* high priests¦143231, it's not necessary¦143228 for him to first make a sacrifice¦143237 for his own sins before doing it for the sins of the people¦143242,\x + \xo 7:27: \xt Lev 9:7.\x* because¦143244 he offered¦143238 himself¦143248—once for everyone¦143226.
\v 28 The law appoints those with weaknesses¦143260 as high priests¦143258, but¦143263 the message¦143262 from the oath which¦143266 followed after¦143267 the law, appointed \add the\add* son who has been perfected¦143274 for the age.

\s1 Yeshua our high priest
\rem /s1 Jesus Our High Priest; Christ Is Our High Priest; The High Priest of a New Covenant; Mediator of a Better Covenant
\p
\v 1 So¦143276 \add here's the main\add* point¦143275 in what we're saying: we have a high priest¦143283 who sat¦143285 down in the honoured seat beside the majesty's¦143291 throne¦143289 in the heavens¦143294\x + \xo 8:1: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*
\v 2 and ministers¦143297 in the holy places¦143296 and in the true tent \add of worship\add* which¦143304 \nd Yahweh¦143307\nd* set up, not people.
\v 3 Every high priest¦143314 is appointed¦143322 to be offering both gifts¦143318 and sacrifices¦143321, and so it's necessary¦143324 for this one to also have something¦143326 to offer.
\v 4 If he was \add here\add* on earth¦143337, he wouldn't even be a priest¦143341 \add because there¦143333 are others\add* offering¦143346 gifts¦143351 according¦143347 to \add Mosheh's\add* law.
\v 5 They serve a copy or shadow¦143355 of the heavenly¦143358 realms¦143358 just as Mosheh was warned¦143360 when he was about to start making¦143371 the tent \add of worship\add*:\x + \xo 8:5: \xt Exo 25:40.\x*
\q1 ‘Make everything according¦143374 to the pattern¦143376 that¦143377 I showed you on the mountain¦143382.’
\m
\v 6 But on the contrary, \add Yeshua\add* has obtained¦143387 a more special¦143386 ministry¦143388 because he's the mediator¦143395 of a better agreement which¦143396 has been legislated¦143400 with better promises¦143399.
\p
\v 7 If the first¦143404 agreement had been faultless, then there wouldn't¦143409 have been any need to find a second¦143411 one to replace it,
\v 8 but \add God\add* blamed \add the people\add* and said:\x + \xo 8:8-12: \xt Jer 31:31-34 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “Listen¦143419, \nd Yahweh¦143423\nd* declares that the time is coming¦143421 when I will make a new agreement with Yisrael and Yudah¦143434,
\q1
\v 9 not like the agreement that I made with their¦143446 ancestors¦143445
\q2 when they held my hand¦143453 for me to lead them out of Egypt¦143459,
\q1 because¦143460 they didn't stay inside my agreement
\q2 and \add so\add* I didn't take any notice of them, says \nd Yahweh¦143472\nd*.’
\q1
\v 10 So this is the agreement that¦143478 I make with Yisrael after¦143483 those¦143486 times, says \nd Yahweh¦143488\nd*,
\q1 putting my laws into their minds and writing them onto their hearts¦143498,
\q1 and I will be their \nd God¦143510\nd* and they¦143512 will be my people¦143517.
\q1
\v 11 Then¦143518 they¦143521 certainly won't¦143520 teach¦143521 each citizen¦143526 and¦143529 their¦143550 neighbours,
\q1 saying¦143534 ‘Know \nd Yahweh¦143539\nd*,’
\q1 because¦143540 all of them from the smallest to the greatest¦143549 will all know me.
\q1
\v 12 Because¦143551 I'll be merciful¦143552 to them when they disobey,
\q1 and¦143557 certainly I won't¦143566 remember their¦143556 sins¦143559 any longer.”
\m
\v 13 In calling that ‘new’, he's made the first¦143575 \add agreement\add* out-of-date, and what's out-of-date and getting old is about to disappear¦143582.

\v 6 And then¦143687 with all of that having¦143689 been prepared¦143689, the priests¦143700 entered¦143698 past everything¦143696 in the first¦143693 room¦143694 of the tent to carry out their sacred¦143702 services¦143702.\x + \xo 9:6: \xt Num 18:2-6.\x*
\v 7 However, only the high priest¦143713 enters the second¦143707 room, and then only once a year¦143710.

\v 17 because¦143926 this \add type of\add* agreement doesn't come into effect¦143930 if the person who made it is still living¦143932, but only when they're confirmed¦143925 as dead¦143924,
\v 18 so even the first¦143939 agreement wasn't valid without blood¦143941.
\v 19 Hence after telling all the people all the commands¦143947 according¦143948 to the law, Mosheh then took the blood¦143958 of calves¦143960 and goats¦143964, along with water¦143967 and scarlet¦143970 wool, and hyssop¦143972 \add branches\add*, and sprinkled¦143982 both the scroll¦143977 and all the people\x + \xo 9:19-20: \xt Exo 24:6-8.\x*

\v 21 Similarly, he sprinkled¦144011 both the tent \add itself\add* and all the utensils for the ministry¦144007 \add there\add* with blood¦144009,\x + \xo 9:21: \xt Lev 8:15.\x*
\v 22 and¦144022 almost¦144013 everything was \add declared\add* ‘clean¦144018’ according¦144019 to the law, because there couldn't be forgiveness¦144031 without blood¦144015.\x + \xo 9:22: \xt Lev 17:11.\x*

\p
\v 23 So¦144033 then it was necessary¦144032 for these copies¦144036 of things from the heavens¦144040 to be purified, but in contrast, the heavenly¦144040 things will be purified with better¦144047 sacrifices¦144048 than that,
\v 24 because¦144053 \nd Messiah¦144060\nd* didn't¦144052 enter human-made holy places¦144058 that were only representatives¦144061 of the true ones, but he entered into heaven¦144068 where he now appears on our behalf in God's presence¦144072.
\v 25 He didn't offer¦144082 himself¦144084 like the high priest¦144087 does every¦144092 year¦144093 with different blood¦144095,
\v 26 otherwise¦144097 he would have needed to suffer¦144101 over and over since the creation of the world¦144104. Instead he appeared just once throughout all the ages because¦144113 sin¦144116 has been annulled¦144114 by his¦144120 sacrifice¦144119.
\v 27 Just as it's been determined that people¦144127 will die¦144129 once and¦144131 then¦144122 there'll be judgement¦144133,
\v 28 so too the \nd messiah¦144137\nd* was offered once \add as a sacrifice\add* as an offering for the sins¦144144 of many people,\x + \xo 9:28: \xt Isa 53:12.\x* but will be seen¦144149 a second¦144146 time¦144146 (nothing to do with sin¦144148) by those who are eagerly¦144152 waiting¦144152 for him¦144151.

\v 1 The law is a shadow¦144158 of the good¦144165 things coming¦144164, not the \add exact\add* image¦144170 of them. Every year¦144174 they¦144180 offer¦144180 the same¦144176 sacrifices¦144177—over and over but never¦144185 getting nearer to perfection¦144190,
\v 2 otherwise they could have stopped offering¦144196 them because¦144197 once they were fully ‘clean¦144207’, they wouldn't¦144193 have needed anymore¦144201 \add sacrifices to appease\add* the conscience¦144202 of \add their\add* sins¦144203.
\v 3 But as it is, every¦144214 year¦144215 there's¦144211 a reminder about \add their\add* sins¦144213
\v 4 because¦144217 it's \add simply\add* not possible for the blood¦144218 of goats¦144222 and¦144221 bulls¦144219 to take away sins¦144226.
\p
\v 5 That's why when \add Yeshua\add* came into the world¦144231, he said:\x + \xo 10:5-7: \xt Psa 40:6-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “You don't¦144236 want sacrifice and offering¦144235,
\q1 but you prepared¦144240 a body¦144238 for me.
\q1
\v 6 You took¦144248 no pleasure¦144248 in whole burnt¦144242 offerings¦144242 and¦144244 \add sacrifices¦144244\add* for sin¦144246.
\q1
\v 7 Then I said, ‘Listen¦144251, it's been written¦144256 about me in the scroll of the scriptures. I have come, \nd God¦144263\nd*, to do whatever you want.’ ”
\m
\v 8 Previously he had said, ‘You don't want sacrifices and offerings and burnt¦144277 offerings and offerings for sin¦144280, and you didn't take pleasure¦144284 in them,’ even though they're offered according¦144286 to the law.
\v 9 Then he said¦144291, ‘Listen¦144292, I'm coming¦144293 to do whatever you want.’ So he was terminating the first¦144303 \add agreement\add* in order¦144304 to be able to establish¦144307 the second¦144306 one.
\v 10 By that agreement, we¦144312 are made holy once-and-for-all through¦144314 the offering¦144316 of \nd Yeshua\nd* Messiah's body¦144319.
\p
\v 11 In fact, every priest¦144330 has stood¦144331 there every day¦144334 ministering¦144335 and¦144336 often¦144339 offering¦144340 the same¦144338 sacrifices¦144341,\x + \xo 10:11: \xt Exo 29:38.\x* \add all of\add* which¦144342 have never¦144343 been able to remove sins¦144346,
\v 12 but¦144350 this one offered¦144354 one sacrifice¦144355 for sins¦144353 for all time, then sat¦144359 down on God's right¦144362\x + \xo 10:12-13: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*
\v 13 waiting even now until¦144369 his¦144373 enemies¦144372 are overcome
\v 14 Yes, with one sacrifice, he's able to make people holy for all time.
\p
\v 15 The holy \nd spirit¦144394\nd* also testifies¦144389 to us, having said¦144400:
\q1
\v 16 \x + \xo 10:16: \xt Jer 31:33.\x*‘\nd Yahweh¦144415\nd* says: This is the agreement that¦144406 I will make with them:

\v 26 If we keep on sinning¦144562 after¦144565 learning about the truth¦144572, then there's no sacrifice¦144579 left for our¦144564 sins¦144575,

\v 34 You all sympathised¦144693 with those who were imprisoned and cheerfully accepted¦144703 the confiscation of your¦144700 possessions because¦144688 you knew that you have a better¦144710 possession that will endure on.

\v 35 Women received¦145386 back those who'd died and came back to life, and others¦145394 were tortured¦145396—not \add relenting\add* so they'd be set free, but instead \add looking forward to\add* obtaining¦145405 a better¦145403 \add reward in the next age\add*.\x + \xo 11:35: \xt 1Ki 17:17-24; 2Ki 4:25-37.\x*

\p
\v 1 So then with us having a cloud¦145490 of witnesses¦145491 around¦145489 us, we¦145484 should discard everything¦145495 that's a burden¦145492, as well as the sin¦145500 that's \add always so\add* near to us. We should run the race that's ahead of us with endurance¦145502,
\v 2 with our eyes on \nd Yeshua\nd*, the originator¦145515 and perfecter¦145517 of our faith¦145514, who endured¦145525 execution¦145527 on a stake¦145527 and disregarded the shame¦145528 of \add that event\add* for the satisfaction that he'd gain. Now he's seated \add there\add* in the seat of honour beside God's throne¦145535.
\p
\v 3 You all need to think about Yeshua and how he persevered when sinners¦145547 quarrelled with him (\add although\add* they \add only\add* hurt themselves¦145552) so that you can be strong on the inside and persevere.
\v 4 So far, you¦145566 all haven't \add had to\add* resist to the point of \add sweating or shedding\add* blood¦145565 in the struggle¦145572 against sin¦145570.
\v 5 What's more, you've failed to remember what \add Solomon\add* encouraged his children to do, which¦145577 also applies to all of you:\x + \xo 12:5-6: \xt Yob 5:17; Prv 3:11-12 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “My¦145584 child, learn carefully when \nd Yahweh¦145589\nd* trains you.
\q1 Indeed, you shouldn't become despondent when he corrects you.
\q1
\v 6 Because it's the people that \nd Yahweh¦145600\nd* loves that he disciplines¦145601,
\q1 Indeed he punishes every¦145604 child that he calls his own.”
\p
\v 7 It's for your \add own\add* discipline that you all have to endure¦145611. \nd God¦145617\nd* is treating you as his children, and what sort of father¦145625 wouldn't discipline them?
\v 8 If you all weren't disciplined¦145630 (which¦145631 all children experience), then you wouldn't be \add true\add* children, but¦145627 rather illegitimate ones.
\v 9 What's more, our human parents trained us when we were children and we changed our behaviour, so, we should accept it even more when our spiritual¦145663 father¦145661, \add God, trains us\add* so that we can have life.
\v 10 Indeed, they were disciplining¦145678 us for a few days¦145672 according¦145673 to what seemed best to them, but \add God our father\add* does it for \add our\add* benefit¦145683 so that we can \add also distance ourselves from sin\add*.
\v 11 No discipline¦145696 seems pleasant at the time, but painful, however later¦145708 it produces peace¦145711 in those who've been trained¦145716 in this way so they do what's good and right¦145718.

\s1 Don't just take God's message lightly
\rem /s1 A Call to Listen to God; Warning Against Refusing God; The fruit of righteousness; Warnings against Rejecting God's Grace
\p
\v 14 Strive to live peacefully with everyone¦145753 and¦145748 to distance yourselves from sin, because no one will get to see \nd Yahweh¦145758\nd* without¦145752 doing that¦145751.
\v 15 Watch carefully to make sure that no one misses out on God's grace¦145767, and¦145777 to make sure that no bitterness¦145773 grows up \add among you\add* that could mess up many people's lives,\x + \xo 12:15: \xt Deu 29:18 (LXX).\x*
\v 16 and \add watch also that none of you\add* are sexually¦145786 immoral¦145786 or godless like Esau¦145790 who sold his own inheritance for a single meal.\x + \xo 12:16: \xt Gen 25:29-34.\x*
\v 17 As you all know, even afterwards¦145806 when he wanted to inherit¦145808 the blessing¦145810, he was rejected¦145811 because¦145813 he couldn't find a way to \add undo what he'd done\add* despite looking for it along with \add his\add* many tears¦145821.\x + \xo 12:17: \xt Gen 27:30-40.\x*
\p
\v 18 You all haven't come to what can be touched¦145827 and to a blazing fire and to darkness and to gloom and to a storm \add (like Israelis encountered at Mt. Sinai)\add*\x + \xo 12:18-19: \xt Exo 19:16-22; 20:18-21; Deu 4:11-12; 5:22-27.\x*
\v 19 and to a trumpet¦145841 blast and \add then\add* God speaking a message¦145856. \add But\add* when they heard¦145849 him speaking, they pleaded for him not to say anything else to them,
\v 20 because they¦145858 could not bear what was commanded: “If even an animal¦145863 touches¦145864 the mountain¦145866, it¦145867 must be killed.”\x + \xo 12:20: \xt Exo 19:12-13.\x*
\v 21 \add Even\add* Mosheh, when he saw how frightening everything was, he said¦145879, “I'm trembling¦145884 because I'm afraid!”\x + \xo 12:21: \xt Deu 9:19.\x*
\p
\v 22 But \add in contrast,\add* you've all come to the city¦145892 of the living¦145894 God (Mt¦145890. Tsiyyon/Zion¦145889), to the heavenly¦145896 Jerusalem, and to myriads of God's messengers¦145900 to the assembly¦145901,
\v 23 and to the assembly¦145903 of the eldest sons who have been registered¦145905 in the heavens¦145907, and to \nd God¦145911\nd* the Judge of all, and to the spirits¦145914 of the people who've been declared innocent and who've been made perfect¦145917,
\v 24 and to \nd Yeshua\nd*, the mediator¦145922 of a new agreement, and to the sprinkled¦145928 blood that says even more than Abel's \add blood did\add*.\x + \xo 12:24: \xt Gen 4:10.\x*
\p
\v 25 Make sure that you all obey \add God\add* who's speaking¦145941 to you, because¦145943 if \add the ancient Jews\add* were punished when they were warned on earth¦145951 \add (at Mt. Sinai)\add*, how much more God will punish any of us who don't¦145945 obey what he \add reveals to us now (from Mt. Tsiyyon/Zion)\add*.\x + \xo 12:25: \xt Exo 20:22.\x*
\v 26 When God spoke back then \add (from Mt. Sinai)\add*, it made the earth quake. However, at this time he promises¦145976, “I'll make the earth and also heaven¦145990 quake one more time.”\x + \xo 12:26: \xt Hag 2:6 (LXX).\x*
\v 27 The words ‘one more time’ mean that God will take away everything that he shakes, since \add it was him who\add* created all those¦146001 things. So¦145992 everything that he doesn't shake \add and¦145992 take\add* will \add last forever\add*.
\p
\v 28 So¦146008 then, since we \add now\add* live in a kingdom¦146009 that¦146016 can't be shaken, we should be thankful, and so offer acceptable worship to \nd God¦146022\nd*, with awe and the deepest respect
\v 29 because¦146030 ‘the \nd God¦146032\nd* we \add worship\add* is a fire¦146034 that burns things up’.\x + \xo 12:29: \xt Deu 4:24.\x*

\v 3 Don't forget about those who are in prison—\add help them\add* as if you all were in prison with them. Also, \add help\add* those who are being mistreated¦146059 because you, yourselves¦146062 are human.
\p
\v 4 Marriage needs to be honoured by everyone and the marriage relationship kept pure, because \nd God¦146082\nd* will judge adulterers¦146079 and those who are sexually¦146075 immoral¦146075.
\p
\v 5 Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because¦146092 \add God\add* has said¦146093:\x + \xo 13:5: \xt Deu 31:6,8; Jam 1:5.\x*
\q1 “I'll never leave you;

\q2 so I won't¦146114 be afraid¦146115.
\q1 What can \add mere\add* people do to me?”
\p
\v 7 Don't forget about¦146121 your¦146123 leaders who \add taught\add* you all God's message¦146128. Reflect on the outcome¦146135 of their behaviour and imitate¦146138 their faith¦146141.
\v 8 \nd Yeshua Messiah¦146143\nd* hasn't changed in the past and will never change in the future.
\v 9 Don't be carried¦146158 away by all sorts of new and¦146155 novel teachings—\add God's\add* grace¦146162 strengthens your \add faith\add*, but \add beware of\add* other \add teachings\add* which¦146169 won't¦146157 strengthen you all because¦146161 \add the teachers\add* don't¦146157 \add even\add* practise what they preach.
\v 10 We \add benefit from what Yeshua offered\add*, but which¦146178 others cannot benefit from \add despite their religious positions\add*.
\v 11 Although the high priest¦146202 brings the blood¦146192 of animals into the sacred¦146197 chambers as a sacrifice for sin¦146194, the bodies¦146205 \add of the animals\add* are burnt outside¦146208 the camp.\x + \xo 13:11: \xt Lev 16:27.\x*
\v 12 So¦146211 too, \nd Yeshua¦146213\nd* also suffered¦146227 outside¦146222 the \add city\add* gate¦146224 so that he could declare the people¦146221 innocent by means of \add the price of\add* his own blood¦146219,
\v 13 therefore we¦146229 should leave \add our religious sacrifices and rituals\add* and share in his¦146237 shame outside¦146232 \add the system\add*.
\v 14 \add Yes,\add* we don't¦146239 belong to any \add earthly\add* city, but we wait for the \add new\add* city that's coming¦146247.
\p
\v 15 With Yeshua's \add help\add*, we should always be praising¦146255 God as if we were presenting offerings¦146252 to him. We do that when we say that we believe that Yeshua \add is God\add*.
\v 16 But \add on top of faith\add*, we need to continue to do good¦146271 and share what \add we have\add* with others, because¦146279 those are the \add kinds of\add* sacrifices¦146280 that please¦146281 \nd God¦146283\nd*.
\p
\v 17 Your¦146287 leaders keep watch¦146292 over your¦146287 \add spiritual lives\add*, knowing that they will have to give¦146302 account¦146301 \add to God for you\add*, so obey them and yield¦146289 to them so that they can \add fulfil their ministry\add* cheerfully and without groaning¦146311, because that wouldn't¦146315 help you all either.
