\mt2 The letter to the
\mt1 Hebrews
\is1 Introduction
\ip It's not known who wrote this letter, but it was sent to a group of Jewish believers. It was written so that their faith would be strengthened because they were in danger of losing their faith due to their sufferings. So then, the writer encouraged them concerning their faith and taught them that Yeshua is the true messiah and God's final revelation.
\ip These three truth were carefully taught: (1) Yeshua who had no beginning and has no ending is God's son and he's greater than any or all of the prophets, or messengers, or even Mosheh. (2) Yeshua has been revealed by God as the final priest, greater than any priest in the Hebrew scriptures. (3) By means of Yeshua, those who believe in him can be saved from sin and death.
\ip The faith of famous Hebrews from long ago is written about in chapter 11. So then, the writer encourages the believers to strengthen of their faith. And in chapter 12, he encourages them again to continue their walk until the end when we all see Yeshua. They need to continue despite any persecution and discouragements that come to them. But it's necessary to know that God disciplines them all as his own children. He finishes this letter with his advice and his warning.

\v 1 Long ago, \nd God¦141919\nd* spoke¦141920 to \add our\add* ancestors¦141922 through the prophets¦141926 in many different circumstances and in many different ways,
\v 2 but in these¦141932 last days¦141931 he spoke¦141933 to us through \add his\add* son who he appointed¦141938 to inherit everything. It was also through him that he made the different eras—
\v 3 \add through the son\add* who radiates¦141950 \add the father's\add* splendour and represents¦141954 his reality¦141956. \add The son\add* bears everything by the message¦141964 of his power¦141966, and after having¦141976 made \add a way to be\add* purified¦141971 from our sins¦141974, he sat¦141977 down in heaven next to God in the seat of the second-in-command.

\p
\v 4 By having¦141987 become¦141987 so much better¦141986 than \add God's\add* messengers¦141989, he inherited¦141994 a greater reputation than them,
\rem /s1 The Son Is Superior to Angels
\v 5 because¦141997 which¦141996 of the messengers¦142001 was told \add even\add* once \add by God\add*:\x + \xo 1:5: a \xt Psa 2:7; \xo b \xt 2Sam 7:14; 1Ch 17:13.\x*
\q1 ‘You are my¦142003 son;

\m And again¦142011:
\q1 ‘I will be a father¦142016 to him,
\q1 And he will be a son to me.’
\m
\v 6 Then¦142024 when \add \nd God¦142039\nd*\add* brings¦142027 his firstborn¦142029 \add son\add* into the world¦142032 he said:\x + \xo 1:6: \xt Deu 32:43 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Let all of God's messengers¦142038 bow down to him.’
\m
\v 7 On one hand¦142042 he said to \add his\add* messengers:\x + \xo 1:7: \xt Psa 104:4 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘The \add one\add* making his messengers winds,
\q2 and \add making\add* his ministers¦142054 a fiery flame¦142057.’
\m
\v 8 And on the other¦142059 hand¦142059 to \add his\add* son he said:\x + \xo 1:8-9: \xt Psa 45:6-7.\x*
\q1 ‘\nd God¦142066\nd*, your¦142064 throne¦142063 \add will last\add* to the end of the ages;
\q1 The ruler of his kingdom¦142080 is a ruler of justice.
\q1
\v 9 You loved¦142083 righteousness¦142084 and hated¦142086 lawlessness¦142088,
\q1 because¦142089 of this, God, your God, honoured you
\q2 with gladness beyond¦142101 \add what\add* your companions¦142103 \add received\add*.’
\m
\v 10 He also said \add to his son\add*:\x + \xo 1:10-12: \xt Psa 102:25-27 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘\nd Master¦142109\nd*, at the beginning¦142108 you established¦142112 the earth¦142111,
\q1 and you made the heavens¦142120 with your¦142117 hands¦142116.
\q1
\v 11 They will perish¦142122 but¦142124 you¦142123 will continue¦142125;

\q2 they'll be changed like \add we\add* change our clothes.
\q1 But you \add remain\add* the same¦142145,
\q1 and you won't get old and fragile.’
\m
\v 13 To which¦142154 of \add his\add* messengers¦142157 did God say even once:\x + \xo 1:13: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*

\p
\v 1 Because¦142188 of that, it's much more appropriate¦142190 for us to listen carefully to the \add message\add* so we¦142199 don't drift¦142199 away.
\v 2 Because¦142201 if the message¦142206 that was brought by the messengers¦142204 is confirmed¦142208 and \add so\add* every¦142210 transgression¦142211 and \add act of\add* disobedience¦142213 received¦142214 the appropriate penalty¦142216,
\v 3 how will \em we\em* escape¦142219 \add punishment\add* if we neglect¦142222 such a great¦142221 \add offer of\add* salvation. This salvation was first heard when spoken¦142227 about by the \nd master¦142230\nd* and then others who heard confirmed¦142236 it to us
\v 4 and \nd God¦142241\nd* testified¦142238 it by means of sign and wonders¦142245 and various¦142247 miracles¦142248 and by gifts of the holy \nd spirit¦142250\nd* whenever he wanted.

\p
\v 5 It's not \add his\add* messengers¦142260 that \add God\add* put in charge of the future world¦142265 that we're talking¦142270 about,
\v 6 but¦142272 someone¦142274 testified¦142271 somewhere¦142273 saying¦142275:\x + \xo 2:6-8: \xt Psa 8:4-6.\x*
\q1 ‘What is humankind that you think about him,
\q1 or humanity's son that you notice¦142287 him?
\q1
\v 7 You made him a little¦142291 less than \add your\add* messengers¦142295.
\q1 You crowned¦142299 him with splendour and honour¦142298.
\q1
\v 8 You put everything under his authority.’
\m By putting everything under his authority, nothing¦142325 is left that he doesn't control, although \add right\add* now we don't¦142332 see everything being under his authority yet.
\v 9 But although he was made a little¦142340 lower than \add God's\add* messengers¦142343, we see \nd Yeshua¦142346\nd* have suffered¦142349 death, \add now\add* crowned¦142355 with splendour and honour¦142354, so that by God's grace¦142358, he experienced death for everyone¦142361.
\v 10 It was appropriate for him, the one who everything was made for and who made everything, having¦142380 brought¦142380 many children to be with God and being the originator¦142382 of their¦142385 salvation¦142384, to become perfect¦142388 through¦142386 what he suffered¦142387.
\p
\v 11 Both the person who is making people holy and the ones being made holy are \add part of\add* one \add family\add* because¦142399 he's not ashamed¦142403 to call them brothers¦142404 and sisters¦142404
\v 12 saying¦142407:\x + \xo 2:12: \xt Psa 22:22.\x*
\q1 ‘I will announce your¦142411 name¦142410 to my¦142414 brothers¦142413,
\q1 I will sing praise songs to you from the middle of the assembly¦142417.’
\m
\v 13 And also:\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Isa 8:17 (LXX)\x*
\q1 ‘I will trust¦142424 \add myself\add* to him¦142426.’
\m And:\x + \xo 2:13: \xt Isa 8:18.\x*
\q1 ‘Look¦142429, it's me with the little¦142433 children¦142433 that \nd God¦142439\nd* gave¦142437 me.’
\p
\v 14 So¦142441 because¦142440 the ‘little¦142443 children¦142443’ are \add all made of\add* flesh¦142448 and blood¦142445, he also \add became a man\add* to be just like them, so that through¦142457 his death, he could nullify¦142460 the power¦142463 of death (which \add comes from\add* the devil¦142470)
\v 15 and¦142471 set free all those who in a lifetime ‘slavery¦142484’ \add controlled\add* by the fear¦142476 of death¦142477.
\v 16 You can be certain that it's not \add God's\add* messengers¦142488 that he's helped, but¦142490 rather Abraham's descendants.\x + \xo 2:16: \xt Isa 41:8-9.\x*
\v 17 That's why he had to be just like his brothers¦142499 and sisters¦142499, so that he could become¦142503 \add the\add* merciful¦142502 and faithful¦142505 chief¦142506 priest¦142506 \add representing\add* \nd God¦142510\nd*, in order to pay the price for the people's¦142519 sins¦142516.
\v 18 Because he also suffered¦142523 when he was tempted \add to sin\add*, he's able to help¦142529 others who're tempted.

\s1 Yeshua is greater than Mosheh

\v 1 Therefore, godly brothers¦142531 and sisters¦142531, who \add share in\add* the heavenly¦142534 calling¦142533, consider \nd Yeshua¦142546\nd*, who we acknowledge as our¦142544 missionary and high priest¦142540,
\v 2 how he was faithful to \add God\add* who appointed him, just as Mosheh was faithful in God's house¦142559.\x + \xo 3:2: \xt Num 12:7.\x*
\v 3 \add Yeshua\add* was considered¦142568 worthy¦142568 of more honour than Mosheh, just like the builder of a house is honoured more than the house itself¦142577,
\v 4 because¦142583 every house¦142584 is made by someone¦142587, but¦142589 the one who made everything is \nd God¦142595\nd*.
\v 5 On one hand¦142599, Mosheh was faithful¦142600 in all of his¦142605 house¦142604, thus serving as a testimony¦142609 for what was yet to be told,
\v 6 and on the other¦142613 hand¦142613, \nd Messiah¦142612\nd* was \add the\add* son over his¦142619 house, which is us if we retain¦142639 our confidence¦142630 and the expectation of our hope.

\v 7 Therefore¦142640 the holy \nd spirit¦142644\nd* says:\x + \xo 3:7-11: \xt Psa 95:7-11 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Today¦142647 if you¦142653 hear¦142653 his¦142652 voice¦142650,
\q1
\v 8 don't¦142654 harden¦142655 your¦142658 hearts¦142657 as \add you did\add* in the rebellion¦142663,

\q1
\v 9 where¦142672 your¦142678 ancestors¦142676 tested¦142673 \add me\add* through trials¦142680,
\q1 although they¦142684 saw¦142684 my¦142687 actions
\v 10 over forty¦142688 years¦142689.
\m That's why I was angry¦142691 with that generation¦142693 and I said:
\q1 ‘They're always straying¦142700 in their¦142702 hearts¦142703 and they don't¦142708 \add really\add* know my¦142712 ways.’
\m
\v 11 As I decided in my severe¦142717 anger¦142717:
\q1 ‘They will never be entering into my peace.’
\p
\v 12 Brothers¦142726 and sisters, watch¦142725 out in case any of you has an evil¦142733 heart¦142732 with unbelief¦142734 \add which leads you\add* to withdraw¦142737 from the living¦142740 \nd God¦142739\nd*.
\v 13 Instead urge yourselves¦142744 \add on\add* throughout¦142745 each day (while it's still called¦142752 ‘today¦142751’) so that some of you won't become hardened¦142755 by the sin's seduction¦142760
\v 14 because¦142766 we are now partakers¦142765 of the \nd messiah¦142769\nd* if we can retain¦142780 until¦142777 the end¦142778 the assurance¦142775 that we had at the beginning¦142773.
\v 15 As it's been said¦142783:\x + \xo 3:15: \xt Psa 95:7-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Today¦142784 if you all hear¦142789 his¦142788 voice¦142787,
\q1 don't¦142790 harden¦142791 your¦142794 hearts¦142793 as you did when you rebelled¦142798.’

\v 18 And who did God promise that they wouldn't enter his¦142837 rest, if it wasn't the people who disbelieved¦142842?
\v 19 So¦142843 we¦142844 can \add now\add* see that they¦142847 weren't able to enter \add the promised land\add* because¦142850 of their unbelief¦142851.

\rem /s1 Promised Rest for God's People; The Rest That God Promised; A Sabbath-Rest for the People of God
\p
\v 1 That's why we might be afraid¦142852: because although we had a promise¦142856 to enter his¦142861 rest, some of you¦142865 might fail to achieve it,
\v 2 because we've already had the good message preached¦142871 \add to us\add* just like them, but the message they heard¦142890 didn't benefit¦142876 them because they weren't united¦142883 in faith¦142888 with the \add others\add* who listened.
\v 3 So those of us who believed¦142899 are entering that rest, as he said¦142901:\x + \xo 4:3: \xt Psa 95:11.\x*
\q1 ‘As I promised in my severe¦142906 anger¦142906,
\q1 They will never enter into my rest.’
\m And yet he's had it \add ready\add* since the creation of the world¦142919.
\v 4 For somewhere¦142923 he's spoken¦142921 about the seventh \add day saying\add*:\x + \xo 4:4: \xt Gen 2:2.\x*
\q1 ‘And on the seventh day \nd God¦142931\nd* rested¦142929 from all his¦142941 works¦142940.’
\m
\v 5 And also:\x + \xo 4:5: \xt Psa 95:11.\x*
\q1 ‘They will never enter my¦142951 rest.’
\m
\v 6 Therefore¦142953 because it's being¦142954 retained¦142954 for some people to \add still\add* come into it, and those who previously¦142961 had the good message¦142962 preached¦142962 to them didn't come in because of \add their\add* disbelief¦142967,
\v 7 \add God\add* designated¦142970 a certain¦142969 day saying¦142976:\x + \xo 4:7: \xt Psa 95:7-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘Today¦142984 if you all hear his¦142988 voice¦142987,
\q1 Don't harden¦142991 your¦142994 hearts¦142993.’
\p
\v 8 Because¦142996 if Yoshua had given them rest,\x + \xo 4:8: \xt Deu 31:7; Josh 22:4.\x* \add God\add* wouldn't¦143002 be speaking¦143005 afterwards¦143006 about¦143003 another¦143004 day¦143009.
\v 9 So then, a time of rest is being¦143012 retained¦143012 for God's people¦143015,
\v 10 because¦143019 anyone having¦143020 come¦143020 into their rest, also rests from their works, just as \nd God¦143037\nd* rested¦143027 from his¦143024 own works.\x + \xo 4:10: \xt Gen 2:2.\x*
\v 11 Therefore¦143039 we¦143038 should be earnest¦143038 about entering that rest, in case someone¦143050 else falls \add by following our\add* example¦143051 of disbelief¦143055,
\v 12 because¦143058 God's message¦143060 is living¦143056 and active¦143064 and sharper¦143066 than any high-quality sword¦143069, even penetrating¦143072 to divide the soul¦143075 and spirit¦143078—\add like\add* separating the bone from sinews—and able to judge¦143084 a person's inner thoughts¦143085 and intentions¦143088.
\v 13 There isn't anything in all of creation¦143093 that's hidden¦143094 from him, but everything is naked¦143099 and exposed¦143101 to his¦143104 sight \add as\add* he's the one we have to give an account¦143109 to.

\v 16 Therefore¦143147 we can boldly approach¦143146 the throne¦143151 of grace to receive¦143155 mercy¦143157 and find grace to help us when we need it.

\v 2 He's able to be patient with those who don't¦143189 understand and stray¦143191 \add from the truth\add* because¦143192 he also is subject to weakness¦143196

\s1 Melchizedek, the special priest
\rem /s1 Melchizedek Is Compared to Abraham; The Priest Melchizedek; The Priestly Order of Melchizedek; Melchizedek the Priest
\p
\v 1 This Melchizedek was the king¦143741 of \add the city of\add* Salem and a priest¦143744 of \nd God¦143746\nd*, the highest¦143748 one.\x + \xo 7:1-2: \xt Gen 14:17-20.\x* He met Abraham¦143753 who was returning¦143754 from slaughtering¦143757 \add several\add* kings¦143759 and Melchizedek blessed¦143761 him¦143762,
\v 2 and Abraham¦143772 gave him a tenth¦143765 of all the captured goods. \add The name Melchizedek\add* means ‘king of righteousness¦143777’ and then king of Salem also means ‘king of peace¦143788’.
\v 3 \add There's no record of his\add* father¦143789 or mother¦143790, no genealogical¦143791 background, and no \add record of his\add* being born or dying, but he's likened¦143799 to God's son in that he continually¦143809 remains¦143805 as a priest¦143806.
\p
\v 4 Notice how great¦143812 this Melchizedek was, \add because\add* the patriarch¦143824 Abraham¦143817 gave¦143818 him a tenth¦143816 of the best of the captured goods.
\v 5 On one hand¦143827, the tithing¦143838 commandment¦143835 from \add Mosheh'\add* law makes the people¦143840 give a tenth to Levi's descendants who inherit the priestly¦143833 office¦143833, even though they're their¦143848 brothers¦143847 as \add fellow\add* descendants of Abraham¦143854.\x + \xo 7:5: \xt Num 18:21.\x*
\v 6 On the other¦143856 hand¦143856, Abraham tithed¦143861 to Melchizedek who can't be traced¦143858 as one of them, and he blessed¦143869 Abraham who had received \add God's\add* promises¦143868.
\v 7 There's no doubt that it's the lessor¦143877 \add person\add* that gets blessed¦143881 by \add someone\add* greater.
\v 8 So¦143882 in the first case, the tenth is received¦143888 by people¦143887 who die, but in the second case by someone who it's \add only\add* testified that he lives.
\v 9 You could even say¦143897 that even Levi¦143903 (whose descendants receive¦143906 the tenths) gave a tenth \add to Melchizedek\add* through¦143899 Abraham¦143900
\v 10 because¦143909 Levi's \add sperm\add* was still¦143908 part of his father's¦143914 body when Melchizedek met Abraham.

\rem /s1 Jesus Like Melchizedek; Another Priest, Like Melchizedek
\p
\v 11 Indeed if perfection¦143924 came from the priesthood from Levi's tribe¦143927 which was legislated¦143937 \add to help\add* the people¦143931, why would there¦143923 have still¦143939 been a need for another¦143945 to rise up as a priest¦143947 in the order of Melchizedek and¦143948 not \add just\add* from the order of Aaron?
\v 12 Because¦143956 if the priesthood¦143958 is changed, then \add that\add* law would also need to be changed.
\v 13 The one that we're talking about here is from another¦143973 tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served¦143979 \add as a priest\add* at the altar¦143982.
\p
\v 14 So it's quite¦143983 evident¦143983 that our¦143991 \nd master¦143990\nd* came from Judah's tribe but Mosheh never mentioned priests¦143997 coming from that tribe,
\rem /s1 Christ Is like Melchizedek; Another Priest, like Melchizedek
\v 15 and it's even more clear if another¦144016 priest¦144015 like Melchizedek¦144012 rose up
\v 16 who didn't live by the physical law \add (of death)\add* but¦144026 according to the power¦144028 of indestructible¦144030 life¦144029!
\v 17 Because¦144033 it's been testified¦144032:\x + \xo 7:17: \xt Psa 110:4.\x*
\q1 ‘You are priest¦144037 to this age,
\q1 according¦144041 to the order¦144043 of Melchizedek.’
\m
\v 18 In the first case, the commandment¦144050 is annulled¦144045 because¦144051 it's weak and unprofitable¦144056
\v 19 (because the law made nothing¦144058 perfect¦144060), and in the second case we have the introduction¦144063 of a better¦144065 hope by means of which¦144068 we can approach \nd God¦144072\nd*.
\p
\v 20 And it wasn't done without an oath, because although \add men\add* become¦144088 priests¦144087 without an oath,
\v 21 but \add Yeshua became a priest\add* by an oath from the one that said:\x + \xo 7:21: \xt Psa 110:4.\x*
\q1 ‘The \nd master¦144099\nd* made an oath
\q2 and won't rescind it.
\q1 You are priest for this age.’
\m
\v 22 Because of that oath, \nd Yeshua¦144122\nd* became the guarantor¦144121 of a better¦144118 agreement.
\p
\v 23 in the first case, there have been many of those priests¦144129 because¦144131 death¦144133 doesn't allow them to continue¦144135 on,
\v 24 but in the second case, because¦144138 \add Yeshua\add* stays alive for \add all\add* the age, he can hold the office of priest¦144148 permanently¦144145
\v 25 and thus he's able to save those who approach¦144158 \nd God¦144162\nd* through¦144159 him—save them to the full extent¦144155 because he always¦144163 lives to intercede of their behalf.
\p
\v 26 Such a high priest¦144175 exactly meets our needs: one who is godly¦144176, innocent¦144177, pure, set apart from sinners¦144183, and¦144184 honoured above the heavens¦144187.
\v 27 Unlike the \add other\add* high priests¦144197, it's not necessary¦144194 for him to first make a sacrifice¦144203 for his own sins before doing it for the sins of the people¦144208,\x + \xo 7:27: \xt Lev 9:7.\x* because¦144210 he offered¦144204 himself¦144214—once for everyone¦144192.
\v 28 The law appoints those with weaknesses¦144226 as high priests¦144224, but¦144229 the message¦144228 from the oath which¦144232 followed after¦144233 the law, appointed \add the\add* son who has been perfected¦144240 for the age.

\p
\v 1 So¦144242 \add here's the main\add* point¦144241 in what we're saying: we have a high priest¦144249 who sat¦144251 down in the honoured seat beside the majesty's¦144257 throne¦144255 in the heavens¦144260\x + \xo 8:1: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*
\v 2 and ministers¦144263 in the holy places¦144262 and in the true tent \add of worship\add* which¦144270 the \nd master¦144273\nd* erected, not people.
\v 3 Every high priest¦144280 is appointed¦144288 to be offering both gifts¦144284 and sacrifices¦144287, and so it's necessary¦144290 for this one to also have something¦144292 to offer.
\v 4 If he was \add here\add* on earth¦144303, he wouldn't even be a priest¦144307 \add because there¦144299 are others\add* offering¦144312 gifts¦144317 according¦144313 to \add Mosheh'\add* law.
\v 5 They serve a copy or shadow¦144321 of the heavenly¦144324 realms¦144324 just as Mosheh was warned¦144326 when he was about to start making¦144337 the tent \add of worship\add*:\x + \xo 8:5: \xt Exo 25:40.\x*
\q1 ‘Make everything according¦144340 to the pattern¦144342 that I showed you on the mountain¦144348.’
\m
\v 6 But on the contrary, \add Yeshua\add* has obtained¦144353 a more special¦144352 ministry¦144355 because he's the mediator¦144362 of a better agreement which¦144363 has been legislated¦144367 with better promises¦144366.
\p
\v 7 If the first¦144371 agreement had been faultless, then there wouldn't¦144376 have been any need to find a second¦144378 one to replace it,
\v 8 but \add God\add* blamed \add the people\add* and said:\x + \xo 8:8-12: \xt Jer 31:31-34 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “Listen¦144386, the \nd master¦144390\nd* declares that the time is coming¦144388 when I will make a new agreement with Israel and Yudah,
\q1
\v 9 not like the agreement that I master with their¦144413 ancestors¦144412
\q2 when they held my hand¦144420 for me to lead them out of Egypt¦144426,
\q1 because¦144427 they didn't stay inside my agreement
\q2 and \add so\add* I didn't take any notice of them, says the master.’
\q1
\v 10 So this is the agreement that I make with Israel after¦144450 those¦144453 times, says the \nd master¦144455\nd*,
\q1 putting my laws into their minds and writing them onto their hearts¦144465,
\q1 and I will be their \nd God¦144477\nd* and they¦144479 will be my people¦144484.
\q1
\v 11 Then¦144485 they¦144488 certainly won't teach¦144488 each citizen¦144493 and¦144496 their¦144517 neighbours,
\q1 saying¦144501 ‘Know the \nd master¦144506\nd*,’
\q1 because¦144507 all of them from the smallest to the greatest¦144516 will all know me.
\q1
\v 12 Because¦144518 I'll be merciful¦144519 to them when they disobey,
\q1 and¦144524 certainly I won't remember their¦144523 sins¦144526 any longer.”
\m
\v 13 In calling that ‘new’, he's made the first¦144542 \add agreement\add* out-of-date, and what's out-of-date and getting old is about to disappear¦144549.

\v 1 The first¦144555 \add agreement\add* had sacred¦144559 rites and¦144561 a holy \add place¦144562 here\add* on earth¦144563,

\p
\v 6 And then with all of that having¦144656 been prepared¦144656, the priests¦144667 entered¦144665 past everything¦144663 in the first¦144660 room of the tent to carry out their sacred¦144669 services¦144669.\x + \xo 9:6: \xt Num 18:2-6.\x*
\v 7 However, only the high priest¦144680 enters the second¦144674 room, and then only once a year¦144677.

\v 16 Where there's an agreement \add like a will\add*, it's necessary¦144884 for the death¦144883 of the one who made it,

\v 23 So¦144997 then it was necessary¦144996 for these copies¦145000 of things from the heavens¦145004 to be purified, but in contrast, the heavenly things will be purified with better¦145011 sacrifices¦145012 than that,
\v 24 because¦145017 \nd Messiah¦145024\nd* didn't enter human-made holy places¦145022 that were only representatives¦145025 of the true ones, but he entered into heaven¦145032 where he now appears on our behalf in God's presence¦145036.
\v 25 He didn't offer¦145046 himself¦145048 like the high priest¦145051 does every¦145056 year¦145057 with different blood¦145059,
\v 26 otherwise¦145061 he would have needed to suffer¦145065 over and over since the creation of the world¦145068. Instead he appeared just once throughout all the ages because¦145077 sin¦145080 has been annulled¦145078 by his¦145084 sacrifice¦145083.
\v 27 Just as it's been determined that people¦145091 will die¦145093 once and¦145095 then there'll be judgement,
\v 28 so too the \nd messiah¦145101\nd* was offered once \add as a sacrifice\add* as an offering for the sins¦145108 of many people,\x + \xo 9:28: \xt Isa 53:12.\x* but will be seen¦145113 a second¦145110 time¦145110 (nothing to do with sin¦145112) by those who're eagerly¦145116 waiting¦145116 for him¦145115.

\rem /s1 Christ's Sacrifice Once for All
\p
\v 1 The law is a shadow¦145122 of the good¦145129 things coming¦145128, not the \add exact\add* image¦145134 of them. Every year¦145138 they¦145144 offer¦145144 the same¦145140 sacrifices¦145141—over and over but never¦145149 getting nearer to perfection¦145154,
\v 2 otherwise they could have stopped offering¦145160 them because¦145161 once they were fully ‘clean¦145171’, they wouldn't¦145157 have needed anymore¦145165 \add sacrifices to appease\add* the conscience¦145166 of \add their\add* sins¦145167.
\v 3 But as it is, every¦145178 year¦145179 there's¦145175 a reminder about \add their\add* sins¦145177
\v 4 because¦145181 it's \add simply\add* not possible for the blood¦145182 of goats¦145186 and¦145185 bulls¦145183 to take away sins¦145190.
\p
\v 5 That's why when \add Yeshua\add* came into the world¦145195, he said:\x + \xo 10:5-7: \xt Psa 40:6-8 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “You don't¦145200 want sacrifice and offering¦145199,
\q1 but you prepared¦145204 a body¦145202 for me.
\q1
\v 6 You took¦145212 no pleasure¦145212 in whole burnt¦145206 offerings¦145206 and¦145208 \add sacrifices¦145208\add* for sin¦145210.
\q1
\v 7 Then I said, ‘Listen¦145216, it's been written¦145221 about me in the scroll of the scriptures. I have come, \nd God¦145228\nd*, to do whatever you want.’ ”
\m
\v 8 Previously he had said, ‘You don't want sacrifices and offerings and burnt¦145242 offerings and offerings for sin¦145245, and you didn't take pleasure¦145249 in them,’ even though they're offered according¦145252 to the law.
\v 9 Then he said¦145257, ‘Listen¦145258, I'm coming¦145259 to do whatever you want.’ So he was terminating the first¦145269 \add agreement\add* in order¦145270 to be able to establish¦145273 the second¦145272 one.
\v 10 By that agreement, we¦145278 are made holy once-and-for-all through¦145280 the offering¦145282 of \nd Yeshua¦145287 Messiah's body¦145285.
\p
\v 11 In fact, every priest¦145296 has stood¦145297 there every day¦145300 ministering¦145301 and¦145302 often¦145305 offering¦145306 the same¦145304 sacrifices¦145307,\x + \xo 10:11: \xt Exo 29:38.\x* \add all of\add* which¦145308 have never¦145309 been able to remove sins¦145312,
\v 12 but¦145316 this one offered¦145320 one sacrifice¦145321 for sins¦145319 for all time, then sat¦145325 down on God's right¦145328\x + \xo 10:12-13: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*
\v 13 waiting even now until¦145335 his¦145339 enemies¦145338 are overcome
\v 14 Yes, with one sacrifice, he's able to make people holy for all time.
\p
\v 15 The holy \nd spirit¦145360\nd* also testifies¦145355 to us, having said¦145366:
\q1
\v 16 \x + \xo 10:16: \xt Jer 31:33.\x*‘The \nd master¦145381\nd* says: This is the agreement that I will make with them:

\m
\v 17 And,\x + \xo 10:17: \xt Jer 31:34.\x* ‘I won't remember their disobedience and their lawlessness¦145404 any more.’
\v 18 Once there's been forgiveness¦145415, then there's no longer¦145417 \add a need for\add* an offering¦145418 for sin¦145420.

\v 21 \add Since\add* we have an incredible priest¦145451 \add presiding\add* over God's house¦145455,

\v 23 We can hold onto the confession¦145484 of our¦145485 unwavering¦145488 hope because¦145490 the one who made the promise¦145492 is faithful¦145489,
\v 24 and we¦145494 can be considering how to provoke¦145499 each other to \add show\add* love¦145501 and to \add do\add* good¦145503 things—
\v 25 not giving up meeting together¦145510 as some have, but¦145517 \add rather\add* encouraging each other even more as you¦145524 all see the day¦145527 \add of judgement\add* coming closer.
\p
\v 26 If we keep on sinning¦145530 after¦145533 learning about the truth¦145540, then there's no sacrifice¦145547 left for our¦145532 sins¦145543,

\v 29 so how much more severe punishment¦145578 do you¦145573 all expect might be considered appropriate for someone who trampled¦145584 God's son underfoot and who has considered the blood¦145587 of the agreement as cheap\x + \xo 10:29: \xt Exo 24:8.\x* and who has insulted¦145600 the \nd spirit¦145597\nd* of grace¦145599?

\v 31 It's a scary thing to fall into the hands¦145623 of the living¦145625 \nd God¦145624\nd*.
\p
\v 32 Remember those earlier¦145629 days¦145631 when you first learnt \add about Messiah\add* and how you endured¦145638 a lot of suffering¦145639—
\v 33 sometimes being publicly¦145646 displayed with derision¦145642 and persecution, and at other times helping others who were being treated like that.
\v 34 You all sympathised¦145660 with those who were imprisoned and cheerfully accepted¦145670 the confiscation of your¦145667 possessions because¦145655 you knew that you have a better¦145679 possession that will endure on.
\v 35 So then, don't toss away your¦145691 boldness¦145689, because it'll lead to a sizeable reward¦145696.

\q1 ‘In still¦145713 a little¦145715 while the one coming will come,

\v 39 All of them were proven by their¦146441 faith¦146442, yet they¦146444 didn't \add actually\add* receive¦146444 what had been promised¦146447.
\v 40 \nd God¦146450\nd* had planned to have something better¦146453 so that we and they¦146461 would be made perfect¦146461 together.

\p
\v 1 So then with us having a cloud¦146471 of witnesses¦146472 around¦146470 us, we¦146465 should discard everything¦146476 that's a burden¦146473, as well as the sin¦146481 that is \add always so\add* near to us. We should run the race that's ahead of us with endurance¦146483,
\v 2 with our eyes on \nd Yeshua¦146499\nd*, the originator¦146496 and perfecter¦146498 of our faith¦146495, who endured¦146506 execution¦146508 on a stake¦146508 and disregarded the shame¦146509 of \add that event\add* for the satisfaction that he'd gain. Now he's seated \add there\add* in the seat of honour beside God's throne¦146516.
\p
\v 3 You all need to think about Yeshua and how he persevered when sinners¦146528 quarrelled with him (\add although\add* they \add only\add* hurt themselves¦146533) so that you can be strong on the inside and persevere.
\v 4 So far, you¦146547 all haven't \add had to\add* resist to the point of \add sweating or shedding\add* blood¦146546 in the struggle¦146553 against sin¦146551.
\v 5 What's more, you've failed to remember what \add Solomon\add* encouraged his children to do, which¦146558 also applies to all of you:\x + \xo 12:5-6: \xt Yob 5:17; Prv 3:11-12 (LXX).\x*
\q1 “My¦146565 child, learn carefully when the Lord trains you.
\q1 Indeed, you shouldn't become despondent when he corrects you.
\q1
\v 6 Because it's the people that the \nd master¦146581\nd* loves that he disciplines¦146582,
\q1 Indeed he punishes every¦146585 child that he calls his own.”
\p
\v 7 It's for your \add own\add* discipline that you all have to endure¦146592. \nd God¦146598\nd* is treating you as his children, and what sort of father¦146606 wouldn't discipline them?
\v 8 If you all weren't disciplined¦146611 (which¦146612 all children experience), then you wouldn't be \add true\add* children, but¦146608 rather illegitimate ones.
\v 9 What's more, our human parents trained us when we were children and we changed our behaviour, so, we should accept it even more when our spiritual¦146645 father¦146643, \add God, trains us\add* so that we can have life.
\v 10 Indeed, they were disciplining¦146660 us for a few days¦146654 according¦146655 to what seemed best to them, but \add God our father\add* does it for \add our\add* benefit¦146665 so that we can \add also distance ourselves from sin\add*.
\v 11 No discipline¦146678 seems pleasant at the time, but painful, however later¦146690 it produces peace¦146693 in those who've been trained¦146698 in this way so they do what is good and right¦146700.

\v 12 So¦146701 then, \add straighten\add* your drooping \add arms\add* and paralysed¦146707 \add legs\add*, and \add be strong\add*.\x + \xo 12:12: \xt Isa 35:3 (LXX).\x*

\s1 Don't just take God's message lightly
\rem /s1 A Call to Listen to God; Warning Against Refusing God; The fruit of righteousness; Warnings against Rejecting God's Grace
\p
\v 14 Strive to live live peacefully with everyone¦146735 and¦146730 to distance yourselves from sin, because no one will get to see the \nd master¦146740\nd* without¦146734 doing that.
\v 15 Watch carefully to make sure that no one misses out on God's grace¦146749, and¦146759 to make sure that no bitterness¦146755 grows up \add among you\add* that could mess up many people's lives,\x + \xo 12:15: \xt Deu 29:18 (LXX).\x*
\v 16 and \add watch also that none of you\add* are sexually¦146768 immoral¦146768 or godless like Esau¦146772 who sold his own inheritance for a single meal.\x + \xo 12:16: \xt Gen 25:29-34.\x*
\v 17 As you all know, even afterwards¦146789 when he wanted to inherit¦146791 the blessing¦146793, he was rejected¦146794 because¦146796 he couldn't find a way to \add undo what he'd done\add* despite looking for it along with \add his\add* many tears¦146804.\x + \xo 12:17: \xt Gen 27:30-40.\x*
\p
\v 18 You all haven't come to what can be touched¦146810 and to a blazing fire and to darkness and to gloom and to a storm \add (like Israelis encountered at Mt. Sinai)\add*\x + \xo 12:18-19: \xt Exo 19:16-22; 20:18-21; Deu 4:11-12; 5:22-27.\x*
\v 19 and to a a trumpet¦146824 blast and \add then\add* God speaking a message¦146839. \add But\add* when they heard¦146832 him speaking, they pleaded for him not to say anything else to them,
\v 20 because they¦146841 could not bear what was commanded: “If even an animal¦146846 touches¦146847 the mountain¦146849, it¦146850 must be killed.”\x + \xo 12:20: \xt Exo 19:12-13.\x*
\v 21 \add Even\add* Mosheh, when he saw how frightening everything was he said¦146862, “I'm trembling¦146867 because I am afraid!”\x + \xo 12:21: \xt Deu 9:19.\x*
\p
\v 22 But \add in contrast,\add* you've all come to the city¦146875 of the living¦146877 God (Mt¦146873. Zion), to the heavenly¦146879 Jerusalem, and to myriads of God's messengers¦146883 to the assembly¦146884,
\v 23 and to the assembly¦146886 of the eldest sons who have been registered¦146888 in the heavens¦146890, and to \nd God¦146894\nd* the Judge of all, and to the spirits¦146897 of the people who've been declared innocent and who've been made perfect¦146900,
\v 24 and to \nd Yeshua¦146906\nd*, the mediator¦146905 of a new agreement, and to the sprinkled¦146911 blood that says even more than Abel's¦146918 \add blood did\add*.\x + \xo 12:24: \xt Gen 4:10.\x*
\p
\v 25 Make sure that you all obey \add God\add* who's speaking¦146924 to you, because¦146926 if \add the ancient Jews\add* were punished when they were warned on earth¦146934 \add (at Mt. Sinai)\add*, how much more God will punish any of us who don't¦146928 obey what he \add reveals to us now (from Mount Zion)\add*.\x + \xo 12:25: \xt Exo 20:22.\x*
\v 26 When God spoke back then \add (from Mount Sinai)\add*, it made the earth quake. However, at this time he promises¦146959, “I'll make the earth and also heaven¦146973 quake one more time.”\x + \xo 12:26: \xt Hag 2:6 (LXX).\x*
\v 27 The words ‘one more time’ mean that God will take away everything that he shakes, since \add it was him who\add* created all those¦146984 things. So¦146975 everything that he doesn't shake \add and take\add* will \add last forever\add*.
\p
\v 28 So¦146991 then, since we \add now\add* live in a kingdom¦146992 that can't be shaken, we should be thankful, and so offer acceptable worship to \nd God¦147005\nd*, with awe and the deepest respect
\v 29 because¦147013 ‘the \nd God¦147015\nd* we \add worship\add* is a fire¦147017 that burns things up’.\x + \xo 12:29: \xt Deu 4:24.\x*

\v 1 Continue to love¦147020 your fellow believers.

\v 3 Don't forget about those who're in prison—\add help them\add* as if you all were in prison with them. Also, \add help\add* those who're being mistreated¦147042 because you, yourselves¦147045 are human.
\p
\v 4 Marriage needs to be honoured by everyone and the marriage relationship kept pure, because \nd God¦147065\nd* will judge adulterers¦147062 and those who're sexually¦147058 immoral¦147058.
\p
\v 5 Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because¦147075 \add God\add* has said¦147076:\x + \xo 13:5: \xt Deu 31:6,8; Jam 1:5.\x*
\q1 “I'll never leave you;

\q2 so I won't be afraid¦147097.
\q1 What can \add mere\add* people do to me?”
\p
\v 7 Don't forget about¦147103 your¦147105 leaders who \add taught\add* you all God's message¦147110. Reflect on the outcome¦147117 of their behaviour and imitate¦147120 their faith¦147123.
\v 8 \nd Yeshua¦147124 Messiah¦147125\nd* hasn't changed in the past and will never change in the future.
\v 9 Don't be carried¦147141 away by all sorts of new and¦147138 novel teachings—\add God's\add* grace¦147145 strengthens your \add faith\add*, but \add beware of\add* other \add teachings\add* which¦147152 won't strengthen you all because¦147144 \add the teachers\add* don't¦147140 \add even\add* practise what they preach.
\v 10 We \add benefit from what Yeshua offered\add*, but which¦147161 others cannot benefit from \add despite their religious positions\add*.
\v 11 Although the high priest¦147185 brings the blood¦147175 of animals into the sacred¦147180 chambers as a sacrifice for sin¦147177, the bodies¦147188 \add of the animals\add* are burnt outside¦147191 the camp.\x + \xo 13:11: \xt Lev 16:27.\x*
\v 12 So¦147194 too, \nd Yeshua¦147196\nd* also suffered¦147210 outside¦147205 the \add city\add* gate so that he could declare the people¦147204 innocent by means of \add the price of\add* his own blood¦147202,
\v 13 therefore we¦147212 should leave \add our religious sacrifices and rituals\add* and share in his¦147220 shame outside¦147215 \add the system\add*.
\v 14 \add Yes,\add* we don't¦147222 belong to any \add earthly\add* city, but we wait for the \add new\add* city that's coming¦147230.
\p
\v 15 With Yeshua's \add help\add*, we should always be praising¦147238 God as if we were presenting offerings¦147235 to him. We do that when we say that we believe that Yeshua \add is God\add*.
\v 16 But \add on top of faith\add*, we need to continue to do good¦147254 and share what \add we have\add* with others, because¦147262 those are the \add kinds of\add* sacrifices¦147263 that please¦147264 \nd God¦147266\nd*.
\p
\v 17 Your¦147270 leaders keep watch¦147275 over your¦147270 \add spiritual lives\add*, knowing that they will have to give¦147285 account¦147284 \add to God for you\add*, so obey them and yield¦147272 to them so that they can \add fulfil their ministry\add* cheerfully and without groaning¦147294, because that wouldn't¦147298 help you all either.
\p
\v 18 \add Also, please\add* pray for us, because¦147306 we believe that we have clear consciences¦147309 and have conducted¦147315 ourselves honourably in everything we've done,
