\mt2 Paul's second letter to
\mt1 Timothy
\is1 Introduction
\ip This is \bk the second letter of Paul that we have that's written to Timothy\bk*. He wrote it from Rome when he was imprisoned there as a result of his preaching about Yeshua the messiah. Timothy was still teaching the believers in Ephesus, so here Paul requests him to come to see him before he gets sentenced to death.
\ip In this letter, Paul advised Timothy to be strong so that he can persevere in his preaching and doing God's work even in the middle of suffering and when others oppose him. He also warns Timothy about the coming evil of teachers of false doctrines because these can destroy the faith of the listeners.
\ip Most of all, Paul reminds Timothy about his life so that Paul's faith and endurance would be an example for Timothy to follow: his humility, his love, and his enduring suffering from those who persecuted him.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul, a missionary of Yeshua the messiah according¦138548 to God's will and with the promise¦138549 of life¦138551 in Yeshua the messiah.
\v 2 \add It's written\add* to my dear child¦138558, Timothy¦138556.\x + \xo 1:2: \xt Acts 16:1.\x* May you experience grace¦138559, mercy¦138560, and peace¦138561 from \nd God¦138563\nd* the father¦138564 and our¦138572 \nd master¦138571 Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦138567\nd*.

\rem /s1 Thanksgiving and Encouragement
\p
\v 3 I've been serving¦138578 \nd God¦138576\nd* with a clean conscience¦138584 since my¦138595 childhood and I'm thankful¦138573 to him that night¦138596 and day¦138598 I haven't stopped praying for you¦138590—
\v 4 remembering¦138602 your¦138603 tears¦138605 and longing¦138599 to see¦138601 you again, which will fill me with happiness.
\v 5 I recall your faith¦138616 without hypocrisy, which I first¦138619 noticed in your grandmother¦138622 Lois¦138624 and in your mother¦138627 Eunice¦138629,\x + \xo 1:5: \xt Acts 16:1.\x* and which I'm sure is also in you.
\rem /s1 The gospel of Jesus Christ
\v 6 So that's why I'm reminding¦138640 you to rekindle¦138642 God's gift¦138645 which¦138649 you received when I placed my¦138658 hands¦138657 on you \add and prayed for you\add*,
\v 7 because¦138660 \nd God¦138664\nd* didn't¦138659 give us a fearful spirit¦138665, but gave¦138661 us power¦138668, love¦138670, and wisdom.
\p
\v 8 So¦138674 because of that, don't¦138673 be ashamed¦138675 of our¦138680 \nd master's¦138679\nd* testimony¦138677, and nor of mine, even though I'm a prisoner¦138684 for him¦138685, but¦138686 let the two of us suffer¦138687 together¦138687 for the sake of the good¦138689 message¦138689 with the help of God's power¦138691.
\v 9 It's God that¦138711 saved¦138694 us and called¦138697 us to live a godly life. His selection of us had nothing to do with anything good we might have done, but rather he has his own purposes¦138708 and had given¦138712 us grace¦138710 via \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦138715\nd* even before¦138717 time began.
\v 10 That grace has been revealed¦138721 now that our¦138729 saviour¦138728 \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦138730\nd* appeared¦138726 and obliterated death¦138736, while at the same time illuminating¦138737 life¦138739 and immortality through¦138742 the good¦138744 message¦138744
\v 11 that¦138746 I was appointed¦138747\x + \xo 1:11: \xt 1Tim 2:7.\x* to proclaim¦138750, as well as being a missionary and teacher¦138754.
\p
\v 12 It's for that cause¦138758 that I'm suffering¦138761 \add here in prison\add*, but¦138762 I'm not ashamed¦138764, because¦138766 I know who it is that I trust, and¦138769 I'm convinced that he's powerful¦138772 enough to guard¦138777 my¦138776 deposit¦138775 \add of hope in him\add* until the end \add of this age\add*.
\v 13 The style of sound¦138784 messages¦138785 that¦138786 you heard¦138789 from me, you need to retain in faith¦138791 in \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦138796\nd*, and with your love¦138793 for him.
\v 14 Keep that¦138806 good¦138799 deposit¦138801 with the help of the holy \nd spirit¦138804\nd* who lives in us.
\p
\v 15 You've already heard that those in Asia¦138820 \add Minor\add* all turned¦138814 their backs on me, including Phygelus¦138823 and¦138824 Hermogenes¦138825.
\v 16 May the \nd master¦138829\nd* show mercy¦138827 to Onesiforus and his family, because¦138834 he often¦138835 cheered me up and he wasn't ashamed¦138843 of my¦138841 chains¦138840.
\v 17 When he came to Rome¦138847 he actively searched for me and found¦138854 me.
\v 18 May the master help him find mercy¦138860 from \nd Yahweh¦138858\nd* on the \add judgement\add* day¦138866, but anyway, you well know how much \add *Onesiforus\add* helped us in Ephesus¦138870.

\p
\v 1 So my¦138879 ‘son’, may the grace¦138883 from \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦138886\nd* make you strong
\v 2 along with everything you¦138890 heard¦138890 from me through¦138893 many witnesses¦138895. Entrust those things to faithful¦138898 people¦138899 who will also be capable of teaching¦138905 others¦138904.
\p
\v 3 Suffer¦138909 together¦138909 \add with me\add* as a good¦138911 soldier¦138912 of \nd Yeshua¦138914\nd* the \nd messiah¦138913\nd*.
\v 4 Soldiers stay unentangled from the affairs¦138922 of daily living¦138921 so that they will \add be dedicated to\add* pleasing¦138926 their commanding officer.
\v 5 Similarly \add the athlete\add* won't¦138932 win the competition¦138930 if they don't¦138932 follow the rules.
\v 6 It's fair for the farmer¦138940 working \add in the orchard\add* to be allowed to eat the fruit¦138945.
\v 7 You should easily understand¦138947 what I'm saying¦138950, because¦138953 the \nd master¦138956\nd* will be giving¦138952 you¦138954 insight¦138957 into everything.
\p
\v 8 Always remember¦138960 the \add promised\add* descendant of \add King\add* David¦138968, \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦138962\nd* who came back from the dead¦138965, which is what I preach
\v 9 and why I'm here in chains suffering¦138975 hardship¦138975 as a criminal¦138979. But God's message¦138982 hasn't been chained.
\v 10 So I will endure¦138990 everything so that the ones that \add God has\add* chosen will also be able to receive their salvation¦138997 in \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦139001\nd* and live with him forever.
\v 11 There's a reliable saying¦139008 that goes,
\q1 If we died¦139011 along with him,
\q2 we will live together with him.
\q1
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12: \xt Mat 10:33; Luk 12:9.\x*If we endure¦139015 with him,
\q2 we will be able to reign¦139017 with him.
\q1 If we disown him,
\q2 he will also disown us.
\q1
\v 13 If we refuse to believe him,
\q2 he will remain¦139029 faithful¦139028 \add to us\add*,
\q1 because¦139031 he isn't¦139033 able to go against his nature.

\v 14 Keep reminding¦139036 them of all that.

\s1 Being God's honourable slave
\p
\v 15 Work hard so that \nd God¦139059\nd* will see you as someone he approves¦139055 of—not ashamed of the \add good message¦139064\add* but straight-talking the truth¦139066.
\v 16 Avoid chatter about unimportant or crude topics because¦139074 it will eventually led to godlessness.
\v 17 Those kinds of talk are like rot that spreads¦139083, as happened when Hymenaeus and Philetus¦139089
\v 18 deviated¦139094 from the truth¦139093 by claiming that the resurrection¦139097 has already¦139098 happened and¦139100 have drawn some away from the faith¦139104.
\v 19 However¦139108 God's solid¦139111 foundation¦139113 has stood¦139117 with this inscription on it: ‘Yahweh knew¦139122 his¦139127 own ones,’\x + \xo 2:19: \xt Num 16:5.\x* and¦139128 ‘Let everyone¦139132 who claims to follow Yahweh avoid disobedience.’
\p
\v 20 An expensive home doesn't just have gold and silver¦139150 bowls, but there¦139145 are wooden¦139153 and pottery bowls as well. Some will contain valuable things, but others¦139162 contain dishonourable¦139164 things \add that we prefer not to display\add*.
\v 21 So¦139166 those people who rid themselves of dishonourable \add thoughts and actions\add* will become a container for honourable¦139175 things, being reserved to do the special work that the master¦139180 has prepared¦139185 for them.
\v 22 And run far from youthful¦139188 lusts¦139189—chase instead after obedience, faith¦139195, love¦139196, and¦139187 peace¦139197 like all the others who follow the \nd master¦139204\nd* with a pure heart¦139207.
\v 23 Refuse to enter foolish¦139210 and¦139211 uneducated¦139212 debates¦139213, because they'll just end in an argument.
\v 24 It's not fitting¦139223 for one of \nd Yahweh's\nd* slaves¦139219 to be argumentative, but¦139225 rather to be polite to everyone and¦139220 to be teaching¦139230 the truth, yet be tolerant of other people's bad behaviour.
\v 25 We should politely point out the wrongs of those opposing¦139236 us and perhaps¦139238 \nd God¦139243\nd* might¦139240 bring them to repentance¦139244 and the knowledge¦139246 of the truth¦139247.
\v 26 After being caught¦139257 in the devil's¦139255 trap just as he wanted, maybe they'll escape and come to their senses.

\v 1 It's important to know that dangerous¦139274 times¦139273 will be coming in the last days¦139271 \add of this era\add*.
\v 2 People will become selfish¦139279, greedy for money¦139280, braggers¦139281, proud¦139282, slanderous¦139283, refusing to listen to sense from their parents¦139284, ungrateful¦139287, ungodly,
\v 3 unloving¦139289, unwilling to reconcile, diabolical¦139291, angry, wild, and without morals.
\v 4 They will be betrayers¦139296, reckless¦139297 and conceited¦139298, loving pleasure¦139302 instead of loving God¦139305,
\v 5 appearing¦139307 to be godly on the surface yet denying that God is real, and¦139314 turning¦139316 from the truth.
\v 6 Some of these¦139318 will quietly enter houses¦139325 and¦139326 captivate¦139327 gullible women¦139330. Despite being¦139334 known for their sins¦139332, they're led by various¦139338 lusts¦139335—
\v 7 always¦139339 ‘learning¦139340’ yet never¦139342 actually confronting \add the reality of\add* the truth¦139345.
\v 8 This is just like how Jannes and Jambres opposed Mosheh,\x + \xo 3:8: \xt Exo 7:11 (possibly these Egyptian magicians).\x* and similarly these people¦139363, having¦139364 depraved¦139364 minds and who are unqualified¦139367 concerning¦139368 the faith¦139370, oppose the truth¦139362.
\v 9 But they¦139373 won't¦139372 be advancing \add in the faith\add* because¦139377 their¦139380 foolishness will eventually become evident¦139381 to everyone, just as happened with \add Jannes and Jambres\add*.

\p
\v 10 However \add Timothy\add*, you¦139389 followed¦139392 me in your teaching¦139395, your conduct¦139397, your purpose¦139399 and¦139390 your faith¦139401, in patience¦139403, love¦139405, endurance¦139407,

\v 12 Anyway, \nd everyone¦139441\nd* who wants to seriously follow \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦139441\nd* should expect to be persecuted¦139443.
\p
\v 13 Meanwhile evil¦139444 people¦139446 and scammers will get worse and worse—deceiving¦139453 others and then being¦139455 deceived themselves.
\v 14 Hold on to the things that you learnt and¦139457 were convinced¦139463 are true, because you know you can trust those who taught them to you.
\v 15 You've known¦139476 the sacred¦139474 scriptures since you were a young child, and the wisdom contained in them is able to lead you to salvation¦139482 through¦139483 faith¦139484 in \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦139487\nd*.
\v 16 All scripture¦139490 is inspired by God and useful for teaching, for scolding and correction¦139500, and for teaching discipline¦139502 and obedience
\v 17 so that the person¦139512 following \nd God¦139511\nd* can be trained in doing every¦139514 kind of good¦139516 deed.

Proclaim his appearance¦139540 \add on earth\add*\f + \fr 4:1 \ft It's not clear if Paul is referring to Yeshua's previous coming to the earth, or to the expected, future coming. (See also 4:8)\f* and his kingdom¦139544, stand by the message whether it's convenient or seems out of place, rebuke and scold \add those who need it\add*, but \add also\add* encourage with complete patience and teaching.
\v 3 A time¦139564 will come when people will no longer be tolerating¦139571 scriptural teaching, but will prefer their¦139576 own doctrines, so they'll find teachers¦139581 to teach what they want to hear,
\v 4 so not only will they avoid hearing¦139591 the truth¦139589, they'll be following myths¦139597 instead.
\v 5 However \add Timothy\add*, you stay sensible about everything, endure hardship¦139604, tell people the good¦139612 message¦139612, and do all your¦139615 duties well.
