\is1 Introduction
\ip This document tells about the people of the nation of Yisrael (called ‘Israel’ in older Bibles) at the time when Shemuel (commonly, but wrongly known as ‘Samuel’) was still their teacher through to when Sha'ul (commonly, but wrongly known as ‘Saul’) led them as their first king. It also reveals the reasons why Sha'ul lost his position as king and why God promised to replace him with David.
\ip Long ago before Yisrael had a king, the people regarded their god as their ruler, but eventually they came to the point of asking God to give them a king to lead them. Both the king and the people were subject to God's leading and expected to obey God's laws.
\ip The main theme of this document is showing how peace and prosperity came when the people obeyed God, and if not, it could lead to destruction. And then sometimes God used his people to apply his discipline to other people groups. It pays to note what's written in 2:30 that goes, “I will honour those who honour me, but those who despise me will be side-lined.”

\p
\v 1 There was a man¦125380 named Elkanah¦125389 from Ramatayim¦125384-Zofim¦125385 \add who lived\add* in the Efrayimite hill country. (He was an Efrayimite—the son of Yeroham¦125392, son of Elihu¦125395,\x + \xo 1:1 \xt 1 Chr. 6:27,34.\x* son of Tohu¦125398, son of Zuf¦125401.)
\v 2 He had two wives¦125406: Hannah¦125409 (who had no children) and Peninnah¦125412 (who had \add several\add* children).
\p
\v 3 \add ≈Every year\add* he would¦125420 \add take his family\add* to Shiloh¦125431 to \add ≈offer sacrifices¦125428\add* to commander Yahweh. Eli¦125436 was Yahweh's priest¦125439 there, and his two¦125433 sons¦125434 Hofni¦125437 and Pinehas¦125438 \add also served there\add*.
\p
\v 4 on the day¦125443 that Elkanah¦125445 made his sacrifice¦125444, he would give portions¦125453 \add of the cooked meat\add* to Peninnah¦125447 and to all her sons and daughters¦125452,
\v 5 \add ≈but\add* he'd give a double¦125459 portion¦125457 to Hannah¦125463 because he loved¦125464 \add *her\add*, \add even though\add* Yahweh¦125465 had \add ≈not enabled her to have children\add*.
\v 6 Then¦125469 her rival¦125470 would provoke¦125469 her and \add ≈try to make her angry\add*, because Yahweh¦125479 hadn't \add ≈given her children\add*.
\v 7 And so it \add ≈happened every year\add*. Every time they went to Yahweh's \add ≈tent\add*, \add @Peninnah\add* ridiculed him, and \add @Hannah\add* would weep and wouldn't eat.
\v 8 Then¦125497 Elkanah¦125499 would \add ≈ask\add* her, “Hannah¦125501, why are you crying? And why aren't¦125505 you eating¦125506? And why \add ≈are you so upset\add*? Isn't it better \add ≈having me\add* than \add ≈having\add* ten¦125514 sons¦125515?”

\v 9 \add One time\add* Hannah¦125518 got up after eating and drinking at Shiloh¦125521. (Eli¦125524 the priest¦125525 was sitting¦125526 on the seat¦125529 near the entrance of Yahweh's \add ≈tent\add*.)
\v 10 \add @Hannah\add* \add ≈was very upset\add*, and she prayed¦125539 to Yahweh¦125542 and wept uncontrollably.
\v 11 Then¦125546 she made a vow, saying, “Commander Yahweh¦125549, if you \add ≈would only notice the misery\add* of your female servant and remember¦125558 me. Don't \add ≈ignore\add* \add *me\add*. \add ≈Help\add* your female servant \add ≈to give birth to a son\add*, then I'll give him to \add *you\add* \add ≈for his entire¦125571\add* life¦125574, and \add ≈he'll never have his hair cut\add*.”\x + \xo 1:11: \xt Num 6:5.\x*
\p
\v 12 As she¦125585 continued praying to Yahweh¦125588, Eli¦125589 was watching¦125590 her mouth¦125593.
\v 13 \add ≈Now\add* Hannah was \add ≈praying from her heart¦125600\add*, and her lips¦125602 were moving \add ≈but she wasn't speaking¦125597 aloud\add*. Eli¦125608 thought \add she must be\add* drunk¦125609,
\v 14 and \add ≈scolded\add* her, “You shouldn't be getting drunk¦125617. Get rid of your¦125621 wine.”
\p
\v 15 “No, my master¦125628,” Hannah¦125625 replied¦125624, “I'm a woman¦125629 \add ≈who's suffering deep down\add*. I haven't drunk¦125637 any wine or intoxicating drink¦125635, \add ≈but rather\add* I've been \add ≈sharing my inner issues\add* with Yahweh¦125628.
\v 16 Don't think that your¦125650 female servant¦125650 is \add just\add* a worthless¦125654 woman, because just now I was \add ≈praying as a result of my terrible anguish¦125658 and¦125659 frustration\add*.”
\p
\v 17 “\add Then¦125665\add* go¦125668 in peace¦125669,” Eli¦125666 replied. “And may Yisrael's¦125671 god¦125670 grant¦125672 your¦125675 request that¦125676 you¦125677 \add ≈presented to\add* him¦125678.”
\p
\v 18 “\add ≈Please assume the best of\add* your female servant¦125682,” said¦125680 \add @Hannah\add*, then she¦125681 went¦125685 on her way¦125687 and \add ≈had something to eat\add*, and \add ≈something had changed in her demeanor\add*.

\v 20 \add @Hannah\add* got pregnant¦125720, and in due course, she gave¦125722 birth¦125722 to a son. She named him ‘Shemu'el’ \add (meaning ‘heard by God’, usually changed to ‘Samuel¦125728’ in English)\add* because she had requested him from Yahweh.

\v 21 \add At the usual time,\add* Elkanah¦125735 and all his household¦125738 went \add to Shiloh\add* to \add ≈offer¦125739 their sacrifices¦125743 and fulfill their vows\add* to Yahweh¦125740.
\v 22 \add ≈But¦125749\add* Hannah \add ≈didn't¦125750 accompany them\add* because she'd told her husband, “I'll \add come and\add* bring¦125759 him when he's weaned¦125757. Then¦125749 he can be \add ≈taken in to\add* Yahweh¦125764 and \add ≈permanently\add* remain¦125765 there¦125766.”

\v 24 \add The next year,\add* after she'd weaned¦125803 him, she took¦125800 the young boy with \add #them\add*, along with three¦125805 bulls, a \add ≈sack\add* of flour¦125808, and a \add ≈container\add* of wine. Then¦125800 she brought¦125811 him to Yahweh's \add ≈tent\add* in Shiloh¦125815,
\v 25 and¦125823 after slaughtering¦125819 the bull¦125822, they took the boy¦125826 in to Eli¦125829.
\v 26 “Please, my master,” \add @Hannah\add* said. “As your spirit lives, my master, I'm the woman¦125838 who was standing with you here to pray to Yahweh¦125833.

\rem /s1 The Philistines Capture the Ark; The struggle with the Philistines; The Ark of God Captured
\p \add At that time,\add* Yisrael went to war against the Philistines. They camped at Eben-Ezer and the Philistines camped at Afek¦126967.
\v 2 Then¦126969 the Philistines lined up to meet Yisrael and the battle spread¦126973. Yisrael was defeated¦126975 by the Philistines and they killed¦126979 about¦126982 4,000 warriors in the battle line in the countryside¦126981.
\v 3 \add ≈As\add* the people\f + \fr 4:3 \ft It seems that most translations assume that this is referring to the remainder of the warriors staggering back into the camp (which is certainly a possibility), but we've interpreted it as the people coming together (with their elders as it says), to try to figure out why they were defeated. (Similarly for v4.)\f* came¦126986 into the camp, the \add ≈Israeli¦126992\add* elders \add ≈asked\add* \add themselves\add*, “Why did Yahweh \add ≈allow the Philistines¦126999 to slaughter\add* us today?

\v 4 \add ≈So¦127014\add* the people¦127015 sent¦127014 \add <men\add* to Shiloh¦127016 and from there they lifted the box containing Yahweh's agreement \add and the sacred platform\add* with the winged creatures.\f + \fr 4:4 \ft And with Commander Yahweh sitting on, above, or between them.\f* Eli's¦127031 two¦127028 sons¦127029, Hofni¦127037 and Finehas, were there with the box containing God's agreement.\x + \xo 4:4: \xt Exo 25:22.\x*
\p
\v 5 \add ≈As\add* the box¦127042 with Yahweh's agreement \add ≈was carried\add* into the camp, all the \add ≈Israelis¦127050\add* shouted¦127053 so loud that the ground shook¦127055.
\v 6 When the Philistines¦127059 heard¦127058 the \add ≈noise\add*, they said¦127064, “What's that loud shout in the Hebrews' camp?” Then¦127058 they realised that the box¦127074 \add ≈with Yahweh's covenant\add* had come¦127076 into their camp
\v 7 and they were afraid saying, “A god¦127086 has come¦127085 into the \add Israeli\add* camp.” Then¦127081 they said, “\add ≈This means trouble\add*, because it wasn't like this yesterday¦127097 \add ≈or the previous days¦127098\add*.
\v 8 \add ≈Oh dear\add*! Who will rescue us from these mighty¦127106 gods? Those are the gods who struck¦127111 the Egyptians with every plague¦127117 in the wilderness¦127118.
\v 9 Now we Philistines¦127123 \add ≈really need to fight with passion\add*, because if we don't, we'll ending up serving the Hebrews¦127126 just like they've had to serve¦127125 us. \add ≈Now, gather your courage and fight for your lives\add*.”

\v 10 \add ≈So¦127134\add* the Philistines¦127135 fought¦127134 \add hard\add*, and Yisrael was \add ≈defeated¦127136\add*. \add ≈Many warriors fled back to their tents\add* and it¦127141 was a \add ≈terrible\add* slaughter¦127142—30,000 foot¦127149 soldiers¦127149 from Yisrael were killed.
\v 11 \add ≈As well as that,\add* the box¦127151 with God's \add agreement\add* was taken¦127153, and Eli's¦127157 two¦127154 sons¦127155 Hofni¦127159 and Finehas were killed.

\v 3 Then Shemuel told all the \add ≈Israelis¦128194\add*, “If you all \add really want\add* to return to Yahweh, remove¦128206 the foreign¦128210 gods¦128209 and the Ashtorets¦128212 from \add ≈among¦128211 you\add*. Then \add ≈decide firmly to serve¦128218\add* Yahweh and \add ≈no other\add*, then he'll rescue you from the Philistines' \add ≈oppression\add*.”
\v 4 \add ≈So¦128225 the Israelis¦128227\add* removed¦128225 the Baal¦128230 and Ashtoret¦128233 \add idols\add*, and \add began to\add* serve¦128234 Yahweh¦128237 only.
\p
\v 5 Then Shemuel¦128242 \add ≈called\add*, “Gather all Yisrael¦128248 to Mitspah, and I'll pray to Yahweh¦128254 for you¦128251 all.”
\v 6 \add ≈So¦128256\add* they gathered¦128256 at Mitspah, and drew water¦128260 and poured¦128261 it out \add ≈in front¦128263\add* of Yahweh, and they fasted¦128265 on that day¦128266 and said¦128268 there¦128269, “We have sinned¦128270 against Yahweh.” And Shemuel¦128273 \add ≈guided\add* the \add ≈Israelis¦128277\add* at Mitspah.
\p
\v 7 \add ≈When\add* the Philistines heard that the \add ≈Israelis\add* had gathered¦128284 at Mitspah, the Philistine rulers¦128290 \add ≈decided to attack\add* Yisrael¦128287. \add ≈When the Israelis\add* heard \add <that\add*, they were afraid of the Philistines
\v 8 and \add ≈begged\add* Shemuel, “Don't \add ≈stop\add* crying¦128314 out to our¦128318 god¦128318 Yahweh¦128317, \add ≈so that\add* he'll rescue us from the Philistines¦128321.”
\v 9 \add ≈So¦128323\add* Shemuel¦128324 got a \add ≈young\add* lamb and offered it up—a whole¦128331 burnt¦128330 up offering to Yahweh. And \add *he\add* cried¦128333 out to Yahweh for Yisrael¦128339, and Yahweh answered¦128340 him¦128340.
\v 10 \add ≈While\add* Shemuel¦128344 was offering up that burnt¦128346 offering, the Philistines approached to battle¦128349 against Yisrael¦128350. \add ≈But¦128343\add* that day¦128357 Yahweh¦128352 \add ≈made an intense sound like thunder¦128351\add* that confused the Philistines and \add ≈the Israelis were able to defeat them\add*.
\v 11 The Israeli¦128369 men¦128368 \add ≈ran\add* out from Mitspah and chased the Philistines¦128376—killing them \add ≈all the way to\add* Beyt-Kar.
\p
\v 12 Shemuel¦128385 took¦128384 a single rock¦128386 and stood it between Mitspah and Shen¦128393. He \add ≈named\add* it ‘Eben-Ezer’ \add (which means ‘stone¦128386 of help’)\add*, saying, “Yahweh¦128405 helped¦128404 us \add ≈all the way up to\add* here.”
\v 13 \add ≈So¦128407\add* the Philistines \add ≈ended up being\add* subdued¦128407 and didn't¦128409 invade¦128413 Yisrael's¦128415 border again, and Yahweh¦128419 \add ≈worked\add* against the Philistines \add ≈as long as Shemuel lived\add*.
\v 14 The cities that¦128427 the Philistines had taken¦128428 from Ekron¦128435 and as far as Gat¦128438 were returned to Yisrael. And \add so\add* Yisrael rescued their¦128441 territory¦128441 from the Philistines, and there was peace¦128447 between Yisrael and the Amorites¦128451.
\p
\v 15 \add ≈So¦128453\add* Shemuel¦128454 guided Yisrael¦128457 \add ≈while he lived\add*.
\v 16 \add ≈Every year\add* he \add ≈did the circuit¦128466\add* around Beyt-El, Gilgal¦128470, and Mitspah, and he \add ≈helped settled disputes for the people in\add* all those places¦128479,
\v 17 \add ≈but\add* he \add always\add* returned¦128482 to Ramah¦128483 because his home¦128487 was there. He¦128492 would \add ≈judge¦128489 disputes\add* there, and built¦128493 an altar¦128496 to Yahweh¦128497 there.

\v 1 As Shemuel¦128503 grew older, he¦128502 appointed his \add two\add* sons¦128507 as judges¦128508 over Yisrael¦128509.
\v 2 The \add ≈eldest\add* was Yoel¦128516 and¦128517 \add ≈his brother\add* was Abiyah¦128519. They \add ≈were based\add* in Be'er-Sheva.

\v 4 \add ≈Eventually,\add* the Israeli¦128542 elders¦128542 met together¦128540 with Shemuel at Ramah¦128548

\v 6 \add ≈But¦128569\add* Shemuel¦128572 \add ≈thought that their request for a king¦128578 was an evil request, so\add* \add *he\add* prayed¦128580 to Yahweh¦128584
\v 7 \add ≈who replied\add*, “Listen to \add ≈everything that the people¦128594 are saying\add*, because they're not rejecting \em you\em*, but they're rejecting me from reigning over them.

\v 1 \add ≈Now\add* there was a Benyamite man named Kish¦128846 (son of Abiel¦128849, son of Zeror¦128852, son of Bekorath, son of Afiah¦128858, the son of a Yaminite¦128862 man) \add ≈who was strong and wealthy¦128864\add*.
\v 2 \add @Kish\add* had a son \add ≈named\add* Sha'ul¦128871 who was a handsome¦128873 young¦128872 man and good—\add ≈in fact there¦128874 wasn't any Israeli¦128877 man\add* better than him, \add and\add* he was \add ≈head and shoulders¦128880 taller than anyone else\add*.
\p
\v 3 \add ≈One time,\add* the female donkeys of Sha'uls father¦128890 Kish \add ≈had gone missing\add*, and Kish \add ≈told\add* his son, “Take one of the servants¦128905 with you, and \add ≈pack up\add* and go and find those donkeys.”
\v 4 \add ≈So¦128913\add* \add #they\add* passed through the Efrayimite hill country¦128914, then through the Shalishah¦128920 \add ≈region\add*, but they didn't find them. Then¦128913 they went through the Shaalim¦128926 \add ≈region\add*, but there was nothing, \add ≈so\add* \add #they\add* \add ≈continued on\add* through the land of the Benyamites, but they didn't find them.
\v 5 \add Finally,\add* they¦128936 entered the Tsuf \add ≈area\add*, and \add eventually\add* Sha'ul¦128939 said¦128940 to his servant¦128941, “Come on. Let's \add ≈go¦128946 back home in case\add* my father¦128950 \add ≈stops worrying\add* about the donkeys¦128953 and \add starts\add* worrying about us.”
\p
\v 6 \add ≈But¦128957\add* he \add ≈replied\add*, “Listen, please¦128961. There's an honoured¦128968 man of God¦128964 in this city. \add ≈Everything he says comes¦128974 true\add*. Let's go there¦128977 now. Perhaps he'll tell us \add ≈which¦128984 way we should¦128976 have gone\add*.”
\p
\v 7 “\add ≈Okay, then.\add* We can go \add there¦129003\add*,” Sha'ul¦128990 \add ≈responded¦128989\add*, “but what \add ≈can we give\add* the man? \add ≈We don't¦129003 have any more food in our bags, and we never brought along a gift. What else do we have?\add*”
\p
\v 8 “Look,” answered¦129013 the servant¦129012, “I've got a \add ≈small silver¦129023 coin\add*. We can give¦129024 that to the man¦129025 and he'll tell us where to go.”
\v 9 (In Yisrael¦129035 before then, \add ≈when people wanted an answer from\add* God¦129042, they'd say, “Come and¦129044 let us go¦129044 to the ‘seer’,” because the prophet¦129049 of today was called¦129051 the ‘seer’ before.)
\p
\v 10 “\add ≈Good idea\add*,” Sha'ul¦129056 told his servant¦129057. “Let's go¦129062 then.” \add ≈So¦129055\add* they went¦129063 to the city¦129066 there¦129069 where¦129067 the man¦129070 of God¦129071 was.
\v 11 They were \add ≈climbing up the rise towards\add* the city¦129076 \add ≈when\add* they \add ≈met some\add* young¦129079 women¦129079 going¦129074 out to draw water¦129082, and they \add ≈asked\add* them, “Is the seer in \add ≈town\add*?”
\v 12 “\add ≈Yes he is\add*,” they answered¦129089. “Hurry \add ≈though\add*, because he's come¦129100 to the city today \add to offer\add* the sacrifice¦129103 for the people¦129105 at the high¦129106 place¦129106.
\v 13 You'll find him as soon as you enter¦129108 the city¦129109, before¦129113 he goes up to the high place¦129115 to eat. The people¦129121 won't¦129118 eat until¦129122 he \add ≈gets there\add*, because he himself will bless¦129128 the sacrifice¦129129. Afterwards, \add ≈those who've been invited¦129134\add* will eat \add together there\add*. So go up there now \add ≈and you'll soon find him\add*.”
\v 14 \add ≈So¦129144\add* they went on up into the city, and as they were entering, wow, there was Shemuel¦129151 \add ≈coming out towards¦129153\add* them to go up to the high place¦129155.
\p
\v 15 \add ≈On¦129169 the previous day¦129164,\add* Yahweh¦129158 \add ≈had quietly told\add* Shemuel¦129163,
\v 16 “About¦129172 this time tomorrow¦129174, I'll send a Benyamite man¦129177 to you, and you should anoint¦129180 him to be ruler¦129181 over my people Yisrael¦129185. He will \add ≈rescue\add* my people from the Philistines¦129191, because I've \add ≈noticed\add* my people because \add ≈I heard their¦129199 cries\add*.”
\p
\v 17 Then¦129202 Shemuel saw¦129203 Sha'ul¦129206, and¦129207 Yahweh told him¦129208, “Look, \add that's\add* the man¦129210 that I you¦129213 \add about\add*. \add ≈He\add* will \add help control\add* my people¦129216.”
\v 18 \add ≈As\add* Sha'ul¦129219 approached¦129218 Shemuel¦129222 \add ≈right there in the middle¦129223 of the city gateway\add*, he \add ≈asked¦129225\add*, “Please tell me, where's¦129230 the seer's¦129234 house¦129233?”
\p
\v 19 “I am the seer,” Shemuel¦129237 answered¦129236, “\add Now,\add* Go up to the high¦129246 place¦129246 \add ≈ahead of me\add*, and you'll eat¦129247 with me today. In the morning¦129251, I'll tell you \add ≈what you want to know\add*, then I'll send you off.
\v 20 As for your donkeys¦129258 that were lost three¦129262 days¦129263 ago, don't¦129264 \add ≈worry anymore about them\add* because they've¦129272 been found¦129272. Now, all of Yisrael¦129277 is wanting your father's \add ≈household¦129281\add*, and \add ≡wanting\add* you \add in particular\add*.”
\v 21 “\add ≈But\add* I'm a Benyamite,” Sha'ul¦129286 responded¦129285, “\add That's\add* the smallest¦129293 tribe in Yisrael¦129296, and my clan's the lowliest¦129298 of all the Benyamite clans¦129301. \add ≈So\add* why \add ≈did you¦129305 talk to me like that\add*?”
\p
\v 22 Then Shemuel took¦129311 Sha'ul¦129315 and his servant¦129318 to the room¦129323 \add where the meal had been prepared\add*, and he gave¦129321 them a place¦129323 at the head of \add ≈table—even above the invited¦129325 guests\add*. (There were about¦129327 thirty¦129327 men.)
\v 23 And Shemuel¦129331 told the cook, “Give the \add special\add* \add ≈piece of meat\add* that¦129337 I \add ≈showed\add* you and said to keep aside.”
\v 24 \add ≈So\add* the cook lifted the \add ≈cooked leg\add* and \add ≈placed it in front¦129355\add* of Sha'ul.

\v 18 one went \add west\add* to Beyt¦131162-Horon¦131163, and¦131164 one went towards¦131174 the wilderness¦131174 where the border¦131168 overlooks¦131169 the Zeboim¦131173 valley¦131172.
\p
\v 19 \add At¦131191 that time,\add* \add ≈there were no blacksmiths¦131177 in\add* Yisrael¦131182 because the Philistines¦131188 \add ≈didn't¦131178 want the Israelis¦131182 to be able to make swords¦131192 or spears¦131194\add*,
\v 20 \add ≈so\add* all \add ≈the Israelis¦131199\add* had to go to the Philistines¦131200 to get their¦131205 axes¦131211 and \add ≈plough blades\add*, \add ≈etc.\add*, sharpened¦131201.

\v 1 Then \add ≈one\add* day¦131259, Sha'uls son Yonatan said¦131260 to the young¦131267 man¦131267 who carried his equipment, “Come, and let's cross over to the Philistine unit that's \add ≈over on the opposite side\add*.” \add ≈But\add* he didn't¦131280 tell his father¦131279.
\v 2 \add ≈Meanwhile,\add* Sha'ul¦131283 \add ≈was still waiting\add* under¦131287 the pomegranate¦131288 tree¦131288 in Migron¦131290 on the outskirts¦131285 of Geba with around six-hundred \add ≈warriors\add*.
\v 3 Ahiyah \add the priest\add* was also there \add ≈wearing\add* a sacred apron. (He was son of Ahitub¦131301 the brother¦131302 of Ikabod, son of Finehas, son of Eli¦131310, Yahweh's priest at Shiloh¦131314.) \add ≈But¦131298\add* the people¦131317 didn't¦131318 know that Yonatan had gone.
\p
\v 4 \add ≈Meanwhile, for Yonatan to get to the Philistine garrison¦131332, they had to go¦131329 through a narrow pass¦131325 between¦131324 two cliffs\add*. (The cliff on one side was named Botsets, and the other¦131343 was named Senneh.
\v 5 \add ≈One cliff faced north¦131354 toward Mikmas, and¦131357 the other¦131357 side faced south¦131358 toward Geba¦131360\add*.)
\p
\v 6 Yonatan said¦131363 to his servant carrying his equipment, “Come on. Let's pass over to that group of these¦131377 uncircumcised¦131376 ones. Perhaps Yahweh¦131380 will \add ≈help\add* us, because \add ≈it doesn't matter to him whether he saves\add* using many \add people\add* or \add just\add* a few.”
\p
\v 7 “Do \add ≈everything that you feel is right\add*,” \add *he\add* \add ≈responded¦131391\add*. “\add ≈Go on ahead and be confident that I'll be there supporting you\add*.”
\p
\v 8 “\add ≈Listen then\add*,” Yonatan said¦131407. “We'll cross over and then reveal ourselves to them.
\v 9 Then if they tell us, ‘\add ≈Stay there until¦131424 we get down to\add* you¦131427,’ then we'll stay where we are and not go¦131431 up to them.
\v 10 \add ≈But¦131434\add* if they¦131437 say¦131437, ‘Come on up to us,’ then we'll go¦131440 up, because that'll be the sign¦131449 to us that Yahweh¦131444 \add ≈will help us overpower them\add*.”
\p
\v 11 \add ≈So¦131451\add* the two of them revealed themselves to the Philistine unit, and the \add ≈soldiers\add* said¦131457, “\add ≈Hey, look\add*. The Hebrews¦131460 are coming¦131461 out from the holes¦131464 there¦131468 where¦131465 they've hidden¦131466 themselves.”
\v 12 Then¦131470 \add some\add* of the men¦131471 \add ≈called\add* to Yonatan and his \add ≈servant\add*, “Come on up \add ≈here to us and we'll teach you¦131485 a thing or two\add*.”
\p “Come on up behind me,” Yonatan told his servant, “because Yahweh¦131499 \add ≈has already declared Yisrael¦131501 to be the victor\add*.”
\v 13 \add ≈So¦131503\add* Yonatan climbed up on his hands¦131507 and feet¦131510, \add ≈with his servant following\add* behind him. Then¦131503 \add at the top\add*, Yonatan struck them down \add with his sword\add* while his servant \add ≈followed behind and\add* killed them.

\v 16 Sha'uls lookouts¦131557 in Gibeah¦131559 (in Benyamite territory) saw¦131556 to their surprise that \add ≈their opponents were starting to scatter in every direction\add*.
\v 17 “\add ≈Count our people and see who's missing\add*,” Sha'ul¦131569 commanded, so they \add ≈called¦131580 the roll\add* and wow¦131576, it was Yonatan and his servant who weren't accounted for.
\v 18 “Bring the sacred chest¦131591 here,” Sha'ul¦131588 told Ahiyah¦131589 \add the priest\add*, because the \add ≈Israelis¦131601 had control of it again at that time\add*.
\v 19 \add ≈But¦131603 even as\add* Sha'ul was speaking to \add *him\add*, the confusion in the Philistine camp was continually increasing, and Sha'ul told him, “\add Oh,\add* \add ≈don't worry about it\add*.”

\v 25 \add ≈But when they¦131736 reached\add* the forest¦131737, there was honeycomb¦131739 on the ground.
\v 26 \add ≈Although¦131764 the warriors\add* entered the forest¦131749 and saw the honey¦131752, none of them \add ≈tasted any\add* because they were afraid¦131762 of the curse.

\v 7 If \add @your father\add* says, ‘That's fine,’ then your servant¦135708 \add ≈can relax\add*. \add ≈But if he gets really¦135711 angry\add*, \add ≈you'll know¦135714 that he's planning\add* evil¦135718.

\v 10 “If your father \add ≈does have a cruel plan\add*, who'll tell me?” David¦135776 \add ≈asked\add* Yonatan.
\p
\v 11 “Come \add ≈with me\add* out to the countryside.” Yonatan \add ≈replied\add*. \add ≈So\add* they¦135799 went¦135799 out to the countryside together

\v 13 \add But\add* if \add *he's\add* planning evil for you, may Yahweh punish me similarly or even worse if I don't inform you, and send you away so you can leave in peace. And may Yahweh be with you just like he used to be with my father.
\v 14 \add ≈But¦135871\add* as long as I'm still¦135874 alive¦135875, please \add keep our\add* \add ≈agreement of faithfulness before\add* Yahweh¦135881 so I won't¦135871 die¦135883.

\p
\v 17 Then¦135920 Yonatan¦135921 got David¦135925 to promise again¦135920 because he loved him as much as he loved his \add ≈own life¦135931\add*,
\v 18 and \add *he\add* told him, “The¦135938 new moon¦135940 \add celebration\add* is tomorrow¦135939, and you'll be missed¦135941 because your¦135944 seat¦135944 will be empty¦135943.

\p
\v 24 \add ≈So\add* David¦136036 hid himself in the countryside¦136037, and \add at\add* the new moon¦136039 \add celebrations\add*, the king¦136041 sat¦136040 down to eat¦136046—

\v 27 \add ≈However,\add* the next day of the \add ≈celebration\add* when David¦136096 was still missing, Sha'ul¦136099 asked his son Yonatan, “Why didn't¦136105 Yishay's¦136110 son come to the meal yesterday¦136113 or today?”
\p
\v 28 “David¦136128 \add ≈begged\add* me \add ≈to let him go to\add* Bethlehem,” Yonatan answered¦136121.
\v 29 “He \add ≈requested\add*, ‘Please \add ≈release me\add* because our clan's sacrifice¦136139 will be in the city¦136142, and my brother has \add ≈told me to be there\add*. \add ≈So¦136135\add* now, if I've found¦136151 favour¦136152 in your eyes¦136153, please let me slip away and \add ≈go¦136136 to\add* see¦136156 my brothers¦136159.’ \add ≈That's why\add* he hasn't come¦136165 to the king's¦136169 table¦136168.”
\p
\v 30 Sha'ul¦136175 \add ≈was furious at\add* Yonatan and \add ≈yelled at\add* him, “\add You\add* son of a perverse¦136181, rebellious¦136182 woman!

It's to your \add ≈detriment\add* and to the shame of your mother's¦136195 nakedness¦136194,
\v 31 because as long as that¦136201 son of Yishay¦136204 stays alive on this earth, you and your kingdom¦136212 will never be established¦136210. Now¦136216, send¦136214 \add men\add* and \add ≈arrest\add* him, because he's \add ≈on his way to the grave\add*!”
\p
\v 32 “Why should he be put to death¦136234?” Yonatan \add ≈retorted\add*. “What \add wrong\add* has he done?”
\p
\v 33 Then¦136238 Sha'ul¦136239 hurled¦136238 his spear¦136242 at him to \add ≈kill him\add*, and Yonatan¦136246 knew \add then\add* that his father¦136252 had \add already\add* \add ≈determined¦136249 to kill\add* David¦136256.
\v 34 Yonatan angrily got up from the table¦136262.

\v 35 \add ≈So it was that the following\add* morning¦136285, Yonatan went¦136286 out to the countryside¦136288 \add ≈at the time agreed\add* with David¦136290, taking a small¦136292 boy¦136291 \add with him\add*.
\v 36 “Run \add ahead\add*—find the arrows that¦136303 I'm about¦136305 to shoot¦136305,” he told his boy. The boy ran and he shot the arrow to \add ≈go over his head\add*.
\v 37 The boy went¦136314 to where the arrow was, \add ≈but\add* Yonatan called¦136323 out, “Isn't the arrow \add ≈further past\add* you?”
\v 38 Then¦136333 he \add ≈added\add*, “\add ≈Hurry up! Don't mess around\add*.” \add ≈So¦136333\add* the boy¦136336 picked¦136342 up the arrow¦136347 and brought it back to his master¦136352,

\v 40 Then¦136367 Yonatan¦136368 gave¦136367 his equipment to the boy¦136374 and¦136378 \add ≈sent him back to\add* the city¦136382.

\v 41 \add When\add* the boy¦136384 \add ≈was gone\add*, David came up from the side and \add ≈dropped onto his knees\add*, bowing three¦136394 times¦136395 with his face¦136391 to the ground. Then they \add ≈greeted each other with a kiss and cried together, although David cried the most\add*.
