\is1 Introduction
\ip This document tells about the people of the nation of Yisrael (called ‘Israel’ in older Bibles) at the time when Shemuel (commonly, but wrongly known as ‘Samuel’) was still their teacher through to when Sha'ul (commonly, but wrongly known as ‘Saul’) led them as their first king. It also reveals the reasons why Sha'ul lost his position as king and why God promised to replace him with David.
\ip Long ago before Yisrael had a king, the people regarded their God as their ruler, but eventually they came to the point of asking God to give them a king to lead them. Both the king and the people were subject to God's leading and expected to obey God's laws.
\ip The main theme of this document is showing how peace and prosperity came when the people obeyed God, and if not, it could lead to destruction. And then sometimes God used his people to apply his discipline to other people groups. It pays to note what's written in 2:30 that goes, “I will honour those who honour me, but those who despise me will be side-lined.”

\p
\v 1 There was a man¦125380 named Elkanah¦125389 from Ramatayim¦125384-Zofim¦125385 \add who lived\add* in the Efraimite hill country. (He was an Efraimite—the son of Yeroham¦125392, son of Elihu¦125395,\x + \xo 1:1 \xt 1 Chr. 6:27,34.\x* son of Tohu¦125398, son of Zuf¦125401.)
\v 2 He had two wives¦125406: Hannah¦125409 (who had no children) and Peninnah¦125412 (who had \add several\add* children).
\p
\v 3 \add ≈Every year\add* he would¦125420 \add take his family\add* to Shiloh¦125431 to \add ≈offer sacrifices¦125428\add* to commander Yahweh. Eli¦125436 was Yahweh's priest¦125439 there, and his two¦125433 sons¦125434 Hofni¦125437 and Pinehas¦125438 \add also served there\add*.
\p
\v 4 on the day¦125443 that Elkanah¦125445 made his sacrifice¦125444, he would give portions¦125453 \add of the cooked meat\add* to Peninnah¦125447 and to all her sons and daughters¦125452,
\v 5 \add ≈but\add* he'd give a double¦125459 portion¦125457 to Hannah¦125463 because he loved¦125464 \add *her\add*, \add even though\add* Yahweh¦125465 had \add ≈not enabled her to have children\add*.
\v 6 Then¦125469 her rival¦125470 would provoke¦125469 her and \add ≈try to make her angry\add*, because Yahweh¦125479 hadn't \add ≈given her children\add*.
\v 7 And so it \add ≈happened every year\add*. Every time they went to Yahweh's \add ≈tent\add*, \add @Peninnah\add* ridiculed him, and \add @Hannah\add* would weep and wouldn't eat.
\v 8 Then¦125497 Elkanah¦125499 would \add ≈ask\add* her, “Hannah¦125501, why are you crying? And why aren't¦125505 you eating¦125506? And why \add ≈are you so upset\add*? Isn't it better \add ≈having me\add* than \add ≈having\add* ten¦125514 sons¦125515?”

\v 9 \add One time\add* Hannah¦125518 got up after eating and drinking at Shiloh¦125521. (Eli¦125524 the priest¦125525 was sitting¦125526 on the seat¦125529 near the entrance of Yahweh's \add ≈tent\add*.)
\v 10 \add @Hannah\add* \add ≈was very upset\add*, and she prayed¦125539 to Yahweh¦125542 and wept uncontrollably.
\v 11 Then¦125546 she made a vow, saying, “Commander Yahweh¦125549, if you \add ≈would only notice the misery\add* of your female servant and remember¦125558 me. Don't \add ≈ignore\add* \add *me\add*. \add ≈Help\add* your female servant \add ≈to give birth to a son\add*, then I'll give him to \add *you\add* \add ≈for his entire¦125571\add* life¦125574, and \add ≈he'll never have his hair cut\add*.”\x + \xo 1:11: \xt Num 6:5.\x*
\p
\v 12 As she¦125585 continued praying to Yahweh¦125588, Eli¦125589 was watching¦125590 her mouth¦125593.
\v 13 \add ≈Now\add* Hannah was \add ≈praying from her heart¦125600\add*, and her lips¦125602 were moving \add ≈but she wasn't speaking¦125597 aloud\add*. Eli¦125608 thought \add she must be\add* drunk¦125609,
\v 14 and \add ≈scolded\add* her, “You shouldn't be getting drunk¦125617. Get rid of your¦125621 wine.”
\p
\v 15 “No, my master¦125628,” Hannah¦125625 replied¦125624, “I'm a woman¦125629 \add ≈who's suffering deep down\add*. I haven't drunk¦125637 any wine or intoxicating drink¦125635, \add ≈but rather\add* I've been \add ≈sharing my inner issues\add* with Yahweh¦125628.
\v 16 Don't think that your¦125650 female servant¦125650 is \add just\add* a worthless¦125654 woman, because just now I was \add ≈praying as a result of my terrible anguish¦125658 and¦125659 frustration\add*.”
\p
\v 17 “\add Then¦125665\add* go¦125668 in peace¦125669,” Eli¦125666 replied. “And may Yisrael's¦125671 God¦125670 grant¦125672 your¦125675 request that you¦125677 \add ≈presented to\add* him¦125678.”
\p
\v 18 “\add ≈Please assume the best of\add* your female servant¦125682,” said¦125680 \add @Hannah\add*, then she¦125681 went¦125685 on her way¦125687 and \add ≈had something to eat\add*, and \add ≈something had changed in her demeanor\add*.

\v 20 \add @Hannah\add* got pregnant¦125720, and in due course, she gave¦125722 birth¦125722 to a son. She named him ‘Shemu'el’ \add (meaning ‘heard by God’, usually changed to ‘Samuel¦125728’ in English)\add* because she had requested him from Yahweh.

\v 21 \add At the usual time,\add* Elkanah¦125735 and all his household¦125738 went \add to Shiloh\add* to \add ≈offer¦125739 their sacrifices¦125743 and fulfill their vows\add* to Yahweh¦125740.
\v 22 \add ≈But¦125749\add* Hannah \add ≈didn't¦125750 accompany them\add* because she'd told her husband, “I'll \add come and\add* bring¦125759 him when he's weaned¦125757. Then¦125749 he can be \add ≈taken in to\add* Yahweh¦125764 and \add ≈permanently\add* remain¦125765 there¦125766.”
\v 23 “Do \add ≈what you think's best\add*,” her husband¦125774 \add ≈replied\add*. “Stay until you've weaned him.

\v 24 \add The next year,\add* after she'd weaned¦125803 him, she took¦125800 the young boy with \add #them\add*, along with three¦125805 bulls, a \add ≈sack\add* of flour¦125808, and a \add ≈container\add* of wine. Then¦125800 she brought¦125811 him to Yahweh's \add ≈tent\add* in Shiloh¦125815,
\v 25 and¦125823 after slaughtering¦125819 the bull¦125822, they took the boy¦125826 in to Eli¦125829.
\v 26 “Please, my master,” \add @Hannah\add* said. “As your spirit lives, my master, I'm the woman¦125838 who was standing with you here to pray to Yahweh¦125833.
\v 27 I prayed¦125851 \add ≈that Yahweh¦125853 would give me a son, and he did, and this is him\add*.

\rem /s1 The Philistines Capture the Ark; The struggle with the Philistines; The Ark of God Captured
\p \add At that time,\add* Yisrael went to war against the Philistines. They camped at Eben-Ezer and the Philistines camped at Afek¦126967.
\v 2 Then¦126969 the Philistines lined up to meet Yisrael and the battle spread¦126973. Yisrael was defeated¦126975 by the Philistines and they killed¦126979 about¦126982 4,000 warriors in the battle line in the countryside¦126981.
\v 3 \add ≈As\add* the people\f + \fr 4:3 \ft It seems that most translations assume that this is referring to the remainder of the warriors staggering back into the camp (which is certainly a possibility), but we've interpreted it as the people coming together (with their elders as it says), to try to figure out why they were defeated. (Similarly for v4.)\f* came¦126986 into the camp, the \add ≈Israeli\add* elders \add ≈asked\add* \add themselves\add*, “Why did Yahweh \add ≈allow the Philistines¦126999 to slaughter\add* us today?

\v 4 \add ≈So¦127014\add* the people¦127015 sent¦127014 \add <men\add* to Shiloh¦127016 and from there they lifted the box containing Yahweh's agreement \add and the sacred platform\add* with the winged creatures.\f + \fr 4:4 \ft And with Commander Yahweh sitting on, above, or between them.\f* Eli's¦127031 two¦127028 sons¦127029, Hofni¦127037 and Finehas, were there with the box containing God's agreement.\x + \xo 4:4: \xt Exo 25:22.\x*
\p
\v 5 \add ≈As\add* the box¦127042 with Yahweh's agreement \add ≈was carried\add* into the camp, all the \add ≈Israelis¦127050\add* shouted¦127053 so loud that the ground shook¦127055.
\v 6 When the Philistines¦127059 heard¦127058 the \add ≈noise\add*, they said¦127064, “What's that loud shout in the Hebrews' camp?” Then¦127058 they realised that the box¦127074 \add ≈with Yahweh's covenant\add* had come¦127076 into their camp
\v 7 and they were afraid saying, “A god¦127086 has come¦127085 into the \add Israeli\add* camp.” Then¦127081 they said, “\add ≈This means trouble\add*, because it wasn't like this yesterday¦127097 \add ≈or the previous days¦127098\add*.
\v 8 \add ≈Oh dear\add*! Who will rescue us from these mighty¦127106 gods? Those are the gods who struck¦127111 the Egyptians with every plague¦127117 in the wilderness¦127118.

\v 4 \add ≈So¦128225 the Israelis¦128227\add* removed¦128225 the Baal¦128230 and Ashtoret¦128233 \add idols\add*, and \add began to\add* serve¦128234 Yahweh¦128237 only.
\p
\v 5 Then Shemuel \add ≈called\add*, “Gather all Yisrael¦128248 to Mitspah, and I'll pray to Yahweh¦128254 for you¦128251 all.”
\v 6 \add ≈So¦128256\add* they gathered¦128256 at Mitspah, and drew water¦128260 and poured¦128261 it out \add ≈in front¦128263\add* of Yahweh, and they fasted¦128265 on that day¦128266 and said¦128268 there¦128269, “We have sinned¦128270 against Yahweh.” And Shemuel \add ≈guided\add* the \add ≈Israelis¦128277\add* at Mitspah.
\p
\v 7 \add ≈When\add* the Philistines heard that the \add ≈Israelis\add* had gathered¦128284 at Mitspah, the Philistine rulers¦128290 \add ≈decided to attack\add* Yisrael¦128287. \add ≈When the Israelis\add* heard \add <that\add*, they were afraid of the Philistines
\v 8 and \add ≈begged\add* Shemuel, “Don't \add ≈stop\add* crying¦128314 out to our¦128318 God¦128318 Yahweh¦128317, \add ≈so that\add* he'll rescue us from the Philistines¦128321.”
\v 9 \add ≈So¦128323\add* Shemuel got a \add ≈young\add* lamb and offered it up—a whole¦128331 burnt¦128330 up offering to Yahweh. And \add *he\add* cried¦128333 out to Yahweh for Yisrael¦128339, and Yahweh answered¦128340 him¦128340.
\v 10 \add ≈While\add* Shemuel was offering up that burnt¦128346 offering, the Philistines approached to battle¦128349 against Yisrael¦128350. \add ≈But¦128343\add* that day¦128357 Yahweh¦128352 \add ≈made an intense sound like thunder¦128351\add* that confused the Philistines and \add ≈the Israelis were able to defeat them\add*.
\v 11 The Israeli men¦128368 \add ≈ran\add* out from Mitspah and chased the Philistines¦128376—killing them \add ≈all the way to\add* Beyt-Kar.
\p
\v 12 Shemuel took¦128384 a single rock¦128386 and stood it between Mitspah and Shen¦128393. He \add ≈named\add* it ‘Eben-Ezer’ \add (which means ‘stone¦128386 of help’)\add*, saying, “Yahweh¦128405 helped¦128404 us \add ≈all the way up to\add* here.”
\v 13 \add ≈So¦128407\add* the Philistines \add ≈ended up being\add* subdued¦128407 and didn't¦128409 invade¦128413 Yisrael's¦128415 border again, and Yahweh¦128419 \add ≈worked\add* against the Philistines \add ≈as long as Shemuel lived\add*.
\v 14 The cities that the Philistines had taken¦128428 from Ekron¦128435 and as far as Gat¦128438 were returned to Yisrael. And \add so\add* Yisrael rescued their¦128441 territory¦128441 from the Philistines, and there was peace¦128447 between Yisrael and the Amorites¦128451.
\p
\v 15 \add ≈So¦128453\add* Shemuel¦128454 guided Yisrael¦128457 \add ≈while he lived\add*.
\v 16 \add ≈Every year\add* he \add ≈did the circuit¦128466\add* around Beyt-El, Gilgal¦128470, and Mitspah, and he \add ≈helped settled disputes for the people in\add* all those places¦128479,
\v 17 \add ≈but\add* he \add always\add* returned¦128482 to Ramah¦128483 because his home¦128487 was there. He¦128492 would \add ≈judge¦128489 disputes\add* there, and built¦128493 an altar¦128496 to Yahweh¦128497 there.

\v 1 \add ≈Now\add* there was a Benyamite man named Kish¦128846 (son of Abiel¦128849, son of Zeror¦128852, son of Bekorath, son of Afiah¦128858, the son of a Yaminite¦128862 man) \add ≈who was strong and wealthy¦128864\add*.

\p
\v 3 \add ≈One time,\add* the female donkeys of Sha'uls father¦128890 Kish \add ≈had gone missing\add*, and Kish \add ≈told\add* his son, “Take one of the servants¦128905 with you, and \add ≈pack up\add* and go and find those donkeys.”
\v 4 \add ≈So¦128913\add* \add #they\add* passed through the Efraimite hill country¦128914, then through the Shalishah¦128920 \add ≈region\add*, but they didn't find them.

\v 5 \add Finally,\add* they¦128936 entered the Tsuf \add ≈area\add*, and \add eventually\add* Sha'ul¦128939 said¦128940 to his servant¦128941, “Come on.

\v 6 \add ≈But¦128957\add* he \add ≈replied\add*, “Listen, please¦128961. There's an honoured¦128968 man of God¦128964 in this city. \add ≈Everything he says comes¦128974 true\add*. Let's go there¦128977 now. Perhaps he'll tell us \add ≈which¦128984 way we should¦128976 have gone\add*.”

\v 7 “\add ≈Okay, then.\add* We can go \add there¦129003\add*,” Sha'ul¦128990 \add ≈responded¦128989\add*, “but what \add ≈can we give\add* the man? \add ≈We don't¦129003 have any more food in our bags, and we never brought along a gift. What else do we have?\add*”

\v 8 “Look,” answered¦129013 the servant¦129012, “I've got a \add ≈small silver¦129023 coin\add*. We can give¦129024 that to the man¦129025 and he'll tell us where to go.”
\v 9 (In Yisrael¦129035 before then, \add ≈when people wanted an answer from\add* God¦129042, they'd say, “Come and¦129044 let us go¦129044 to the ‘seer’,” because the prophet¦129049 of today was called¦129051 the ‘seer’ before.)
\p
\v 10 “\add ≈Good idea\add*,” Sha'ul¦129056 told his servant¦129057. “Let's go¦129062 then.” \add ≈So¦129055\add* they went¦129063 to the city¦129066 there¦129069 where¦129067 the man¦129070 of God¦129071 was.

\v 12 “\add ≈Yes he is\add*,” they answered¦129089. “Hurry \add ≈though\add*, because he's come¦129100 to the city today \add to offer\add* the sacrifice¦129103 for the people¦129105 at the high¦129106 place¦129106.
\v 13 You'll find him as soon as you enter¦129108 the city¦129109, before¦129113 he goes up to the high place¦129115 to eat.

\v 15 \add ≈On the previous day¦129164,\add* Yahweh¦129158 \add ≈had quietly told\add* Shemuel,

\v 1 Then \add ≈one\add* day¦131259, Sha'uls son Yonatan said¦131260 to the young¦131267 man¦131267 who carried his equipment, “Come, and let's cross over to the Philistine unit that's \add ≈over on the opposite side\add*.” \add ≈But\add* he didn't¦131280 tell his father¦131279.
\v 2 \add ≈Meanwhile,\add* Sha'ul¦131283 \add ≈was still waiting\add* under¦131287 the pomegranate¦131288 tree¦131288 in Migron¦131290 on the outskirts¦131285 of Geba with around six-hundred \add ≈warriors\add*.
\v 3 Ahiyah \add the priest\add* was also there \add ≈wearing\add* a sacred apron. (He was son of Ahitub¦131301 the brother¦131302 of Ikabod, son of Finehas, son of Eli¦131310, Yahweh's priest at Shiloh¦131314.) \add ≈But¦131298\add* the people¦131317 didn't¦131318 know that Yonatan had gone.
\p
\v 4 \add ≈Meanwhile, for Yonatan to get to the Philistine garrison¦131332, they had to go¦131329 through a narrow pass¦131325 between¦131324 two cliffs\add*. (The cliff on one side was named Botsets, and the other¦131343 was named Senneh.
\v 5 \add ≈One cliff faced north¦131354 toward Mikmas, and¦131357 the other¦131357 side faced south¦131358 toward Geba¦131360\add*.)
\p
\v 6 Yonatan said¦131363 to his servant carrying his equipment, “Come on. Let's pass over to that group of these¦131377 uncircumcised¦131376 ones. Perhaps Yahweh¦131380 will \add ≈help\add* us, because \add ≈it doesn't matter to him whether he saves\add* using many \add people\add* or \add just\add* a few.”
\p
\v 7 “Do \add ≈everything that you feel is right\add*,” \add *he\add* \add ≈responded¦131391\add*. “\add ≈Go on ahead and be confident that I'll be there supporting you\add*.”
\p
\v 8 “\add ≈Listen then\add*,” Yonatan said¦131407. “We'll cross over and then reveal ourselves to them.
\v 9 Then if they tell us, ‘\add ≈Stay there until¦131424 we get down to\add* you¦131427,’ then we'll stay where we are and not go¦131431 up to them.
\v 10 \add ≈But¦131434\add* if they¦131437 say¦131437, ‘Come on up to us,’ then we'll go¦131440 up, because that'll be the sign¦131449 to us that Yahweh¦131444 \add ≈will help us overpower them\add*.”
\p
\v 11 \add ≈So¦131451\add* the two of them revealed themselves to the Philistine unit, and the \add ≈soldiers\add* said¦131457, “\add ≈Hey, look\add*. The Hebrews¦131460 are coming¦131461 out from the holes¦131464 there¦131468 where¦131465 they've hidden¦131466 themselves.”
\v 12 Then¦131470 \add some\add* of the men¦131471 \add ≈called\add* to Yonatan and his \add ≈servant\add*, “Come on up \add ≈here to us and we'll teach you¦131485 a thing or two\add*.”
\p “Come on up behind me,” Yonatan told his servant, “because Yahweh¦131499 \add ≈has already declared Yisrael¦131501 to be the victor\add*.”
\v 13 \add ≈So¦131503\add* Yonatan climbed up on his hands¦131507 and feet¦131510, \add ≈with his servant following\add* behind him. Then¦131503 \add at the top\add*, Yonatan struck them down \add with his sword\add* while his servant \add ≈followed behind and\add* killed them.

\v 17 “\add ≈Count our people and see who's missing\add*,” Sha'ul¦131569 commanded, so they \add ≈called¦131580 the roll\add* and wow¦131576, it was Yonatan and his servant who weren't accounted for.
\v 18 “Bring the sacred chest¦131591 here,” Sha'ul¦131588 told Ahiyah¦131589 \add the priest\add*, because the \add ≈Israelis¦131601 had control of it again at that time\add*.

\v 24 “\add Yes,\add* I've sinned¦132754,” Sha'ul¦132750 \add ≈responded¦132749\add*. “\add I can see that\add* I've \add ≈disobeyed Yahweh's instruction, and yours too\add*, because I feared¦132767 the people¦132770 and \add ≈did what they were requesting\add*.
\v 25 \add ≈But¦132774\add* now, please¦132776 forgive¦132775 my sin¦132779 and come back with me so I¦132777 can worship¦132782 Yahweh¦132783.”
\p
\v 26 “\add No,\add* I won't¦132790 return¦132791 with you.” Shemuel \add ≈replied\add*. “You've rejected Yahweh's \add ≈instructions\add*, and Yahweh has \add already\add* rejected you as Yisrael's¦132805 king¦132802.”
\p
\v 27 \add ≈As\add* Shemuel turned¦132808 around to go¦132810, \add @Sha'ul\add* grabbed the edge of his robe¦132814 and it tore.\x + \xo 15:27-28: \xt 1Sam 28:17; 1Ki 11:30-31.\x*
\v 28 “Today, Yahweh¦132821 has torn the kingdom of Yisrael¦132825 away from you,” Shemuel told him. “And he's given¦132828 it to \add ≈another man who's\add* better¦132830 than you.
\v 29 And \add ≈by the way\add*, Yisrael's¦132835 powerful \add God\add* doesn't \add ≈go back on his word\add*, and¦132838 doesn't change¦132844 his mind \add ≈like people tend to do\add*.
\p
\v 30 “\add It's true that\add* I've sinned¦132847,” Sha'ul said¦132846, “\add but\add* please¦132850 honour¦132849 me now in front of the Israeli people¦132854 and their elders¦132852. And then return¦132857 with me, so I can worship¦132859 your¦132861 God¦132861 Yahweh¦132860.”
\v 31 \add ≈So¦132863\add* Shemuel followed Sha'ul back, and¦132867 Sha'ul worshipped¦132867 Yahweh¦132869.

\p
\v 32 Then Shemuel \add ≈commanded\add*, “Bring the Amalekite King Agag over here to me.”

\q1 “Just as your sword¦132899 has made women childless,

\v 34 Then Shemuel went \add home\add* to Ramah¦132917, and Sha'ul¦132918 returned to his house¦132922 in Gibeah¦132923.
\v 35 \add After that,\add* Shemuel never saw Sha'ul again, but he mourned¦132940 for him, and Yahweh regretted¦132946 that he'd made Sha'ul king¦132949 over Yisrael¦132955.

\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh¦132959 spoke to Shemuel, “\add ≈How long are you going to keep mourning¦132967 for Sha'ul¦132970 for\add*, when I myself have rejected¦132972 him as king over Yisrael¦132976? Fill your horn with oil and go. I'll send you to Yishay¦132984 (Jesse) from Bethlehem, because I've seen \add ≈one of his sons who'd make a\add* \add good\add* king for me.”
\p
\v 2 “How can I \add ≈do that\add*?” \add ≈asked\add* Shemuel. “Sha'ul¦133000 would kill¦133001 me if he heard about it.”
\p “Take a heifer¦133005 \add ≈with you\add*,” Yahweh said, “and say, ‘I've come¦133012 to sacrifice¦133010 to Yahweh.’
\v 3 \add ≈Invite\add* Yishay¦133015 to the sacrifice¦133016, and I'll show you what do to \add ≈from there\add*, and you should anoint¦133023 the one I tell you to.”
\p
\v 4 \add ≈So¦133031\add* Shemuel did what Yahweh¦133036 had told him, and went¦133037 to Bethlehem. The town elders¦133041 trembled¦133040 when they met him, and \add ≈asked\add*, “Do you come¦133046 in peace¦133045?”
\p
\v 5 “\add Yes,\add* in peace¦133050,” he \add ≈answered\add* “I've come to sacrifice to Yahweh¦133052. Purify yourselves¦133054 and come with me to the sacrifice.” Then¦133048 he purified Yishay¦133061 and his sons¦133064 and called¦133065 them to the sacrifice.
\p
\v 6 \add ≈When they¦133070 arrived\add*, \add @Shemuel\add* saw¦133071 Eliab¦133074 and \add ≈thought\add*, “Surely \add ≈this man's the one that Yahweh¦133078 wants to anoint¦133079\add*.”
\v 7 \add ≈But¦133081\add* Yahweh told \add *him\add*, “Don't look¦133088 at his height¦133094 or outward¦133107 appearance, because I've rejected¦133097 him. Because it isn't¦133086 what a person sees with their eyes, but Yahweh sees \add ≈their motives and values\add*.”
\p
\v 8 Then¦133112 Yishay¦133113 called¦133112 for Abinadab¦133116 to \add ≈walk across in front¦133118\add* of Shemuel¦133119, \add ≈but\add* he said¦133120 again, “Yahweh¦133127 hasn't chosen¦133126 that one.”
\v 9 Then¦133129 Yishay¦133130 made Shammah¦133131 \add ≈walk across in front\add*, \add ≈but\add* again he¦133138 said¦133132, “Yahweh¦133139 hasn't chosen¦133138 that one.”
\v 10 \add ≈So¦133141\add* \add all up,\add* Yishay made seven¦133143 of his sons¦133144 \add ≈walk across in front¦133145\add* of Shemuel, \add ≈but\add* Shemuel told \add *him\add*, “Yahweh¦133155 hasn't chosen¦133154 any of them.”
\v 11 Then¦133158 Shemuel \add ≈asked\add* Yishay, “\add ≈Is this all your sons¦133164\add*?”
\p “\add Well,\add* there's just the youngest¦133168,” he \add ≈answered\add* “\add ≈but\add* you see, he's \add out\add* \add ≈looking after\add* the flock.”\f + \fr 16:11 \ft We deliberately left the word ‘flock’ here (rather than ‘sheep’), because although young David is always thought of as ‘the shepherd boy’ in English culture, in the middle-East, \bd goats\bd* are probably a more important part of the flock than sheep.\f*
\p “Send for him,” Shemuel \add ≈instructed\add* \add *him\add*, “because we won't¦133180 \add ≈do anything else until¦133183 he gets\add* here.”
\v 12 \add ≈So¦133188\add* he sent¦133188 for him and brought¦133189 him in. He was a good-looker with beautiful¦133194 eyes¦133195 and red colouring, and Yahweh¦133200 said¦133199, “\add ≈Stand up\add* \add and\add* anoint¦133202 him, because \add ≈he's the one\add*.”
\v 13 \add ≈So¦133208\add* Shemuel took¦133208 the horn \add full\add* of \add olive\add* oil and anointed¦133214 him \add ≈right there with\add* his brothers¦133217, and Yahweh's spirit¦133219 rushed onto David¦133224 from that day¦133225 onwards¦133227. Then¦133208 Shemuel left and went¦133230 \add home\add* to Ramah¦133231.

\v 14 \add Meanwhile,\add* Yahweh's spirit left Sha'ul¦133238, and \add instead\add* an evil spirit from Yahweh tormented¦133239 him,
\v 15 and \add *his\add* servants¦133247 told him, “Look¦133249, an evil¦133257 spirit¦133254 from God¦133256 is tormenting¦133258 you¦133258.
\v 16 Let our master¦133263 please¦133262 \add ≈get your servants¦133264\add* to find a man who knows¦133268 how to play the harp. \add ≈Then, whenever\add* the evil¦133277 spirit¦133274 from God¦133276 is on you, then he'll play \add ≈it\add* and it'll be good¦133280 for you.”
\p
\v 17 “\add Okay,\add*” Sha'ul¦133285 \add ≈responded¦133284\add*, “Find a man for me who's good at playing \add <it\add*, and bring¦133296 him to me.”
\p
\v 18 Then¦133299 one of his servants \add ≈spoke up\add*, “Listen, I've \add ≈noticed one of the sons\add* of Yishay¦133306 \add ≈in Bethlehem\add* who knows¦133309 how to play. \add He's also\add* \add ≈a very powerful warrior\add*, as well as being \add ≈good looking\add* and \add ≈wise in what he says\add*. And Yahweh is with him.”
\p
\v 19 \add ≈So¦133322\add* Sha'ul¦133323 sent¦133322 messengers¦133324 to Yishay¦133327 \add ≈to tell him\add*, “Your¦133331 son David¦133333 who looks after your¦133334 flock, send¦133329 him to me.”
\v 20 \add ≈So¦133338\add* Yishay¦133339 loaded a donkey¦133340 with bread¦133341, a skin of wine, and a young¦133344 goat¦133344, and sent¦133347 them to \add King\add* Sha'ul¦133354 with his son David¦133350.
\v 21 \add ≈When¦133360\add* David¦133357 got to \add *the king\add*, \add ≈he became his servant\add*, and \add ≈he was liked so much that he was appointed as the one who carried the king's equipment\add*.
\v 22 Sha'ul¦133372 sent¦133371 \add a message back\add* to Yishay¦133375, saying, “Let David¦133380 \add ≈remain in my service\add*, because \add ≈I really like him¦133377\add*.”
\v 23 Then¦133388 whenever the spirit from God¦133392 \add ≈tormented\add* Sha'ul, David¦133397 would take the harp and play it. \add ≈That would bring\add* relief¦133403 to Sha'ul and \add ≈make him feel better\add*, and the evil spirit would \add ≈leave\add* him.

\v 1 \add At that time,\add* the Philistines¦133414 gathered their¦133417 \add army\add* divisions together ready for battle¦133418. They assembled at Sokoh in Yehudah¦133422, and camped¦133423 between Sokoh and Azekah¦133429 in Efes-Dammim.
\v 2 Sha'ul¦133433 and the Israeli¦133436 \add ≈warriors\add* gathered¦133437 and camped¦133438 in the Elah¦133440 valley¦133439, then they¦133437 arranged themselves for battle¦133442 against the Philistines¦133444.
\v 3 \add ≈So¦133446\add* the Philistines¦133446 stood on one hill and \add ≈the Israelis¦133452\add* on the \add opposite\add* hill, with the valley¦133458 between¦133459 them.
\p
\v 4 Then¦133461 the Philistines¦133466 \add ≈sent a champion\add* out from their camp \add to represent them\add*. His name¦133468 was Goliat¦133467 and he came from Gat¦133469, and he was almost three metres¦133472\f + \fr 17:4 \ft Some Greek sources have a height closer to two metres.\f* \add ≈tall\add*.
\v 5 He \add ≈wore\add* a bronze helmet¦133475, and his body armour had \add ≈overlapping plates\add* weighing¦133484 \add a total of\add* some fifty-five kilograms.
\v 6 He had bronze armour on his legs, and¦133497 a bronze plate\f + \fr 17:6b \ft It's not totally clear what's being described in the second part of this sentence, so other interpretations might differ.\f* between¦133499 his shoulders¦133500.
\v 7 The wooden \add shaft¦133502 of\add* his spear was like a weaver's¦133506 beam and his spear time weighed around seven kilograms. His¦133517 shield-bearer walked in front¦133517 of him¦133517.
\v 8 \add @Goliat\add* stood¦133519 \add there\add* and called¦133520 out to the Israeli \add ≈warriors\add*, “Why have you all come out to \add ≈line up\add* for battle? \add Now,\add* \add ≈I'm\add* \add down here as\add* a Philistine¦133533, and all of you are Sha'ul's slaves, \add so\add* choose a man¦133540 for yourselves and let him come down \add here to fight\add* me.

\v 12 \f + \fr 17:12 \ft Verses 12–31 aren't included in every ancient Greek translation.\f*\add ≈Now\add* David¦133598 was the son of Yishay¦133608 (from the Efrat clan, he lived in Bethlehem in Yehudah¦133606) who had eight¦133610 sons¦133611, and by Sha'ul's time, was quite old compared to other men¦133617.\f + \fr 17:12 \ft There's a small variation in the original manuscripts at the end of the verse, but it has minimal effect on the essential story-line.\f*
\v 13 Yishay's¦133623 three oldest sons (Eliab¦133637, Abinadab¦133640, and Shammah¦133642) had gone to the battle with Sha'ul¦133628,

\v 15 David¦133654 \add ≈went back and forth between\add* Sha'ul\add 's camp\add* and looking after his father's¦133663 flock¦133662 at Bethlehem.
\p
\v 16 For forty¦133673 days, the Philistine¦133669 \add champion\add* came¦133668 out and presented himself in the early¦133670 morning and \add again\add* in the evening¦133671.
\p
\v 17 \add One day\add* Yishay¦133678 said to his son David¦133679, “\add ≈Here's a sack\add* of roasted¦133686 grain¦133686 and ten loaves of bread¦133689. Take them straight away to your brothers at the camp.
\v 18 And take¦133712 these¦133699 ten¦133696 cuts of cheese¦133698 to the commander¦133701 of \add ≈their¦133711 unit\add*. \add ≈Find out how\add* your¦133706 brothers¦133706 \add ≈are doing\add* and bring¦133700 back \add ≈anything they want to send to me\add*.

\v 21 The Israelis and¦133754 the Philistines¦133754 arranged \add themselves\add*—battle line to battle line.
\v 22 David¦133760 left \add ≈what he'd brought\add* with a \add ≈guard\add*, and ran¦133770 into the battle¦133771 line. Then¦133759 he \add ≈caught up with\add* his brothers¦133774 and asked¦133773 \add ≈them how they were doing\add*.
\v 23 \add ≈While¦133792\add* he was talking¦133779 with them, look, the Philistine¦133786 \add ≈champion\add* from Gat¦133788 was coming¦133784 out \add ≈with his challenge\add*. Goliat¦133785 spoke¦133793 \add ≈like he had before\add* and David¦133797 \add ≈heard it all\add*.
\v 24 \add ≈But¦133799 when\add* the Israelis¦133801 saw¦133802 the \add ≈champion\add*, they¦133802 were \add ≈terrified\add* and fled \add ≈away from him¦133807\add*.
\v 25 saying \add to each other\add*, “Have you seen this man who's coming out? He's certainly coming to mock Yisrael¦133814!

\p
\v 26 “What \add was it that'll\add* be done for the man¦133859 who \add ≈kills\add* this Philistine and take's Yisrael's¦133869 disgrace away?” David¦133849 asked some of the men¦133852 standing¦133853 around him. “Because who does that uncircumcised¦133873 Philistine \add think he is\add* that he would taunt the \add ≈army\add* of the living¦133879 God¦133878?”
\v 27 Then¦133881 the \add ≈men\add* told him \add ≈again\add* what would be given to the man¦133889 who \add ≈defeats\add* him.

\v 28 \add ≈But¦133893 when\add* David's¦133905 oldest¦133896 brother Eliab¦133894 heard him talking to the men¦133900, \add ≈he got very angry\add* and \add ≈scolded\add* him, “Why have you come down here?

\v 32 David¦133971 told \add *the king\add*, “Don't \add ≈be discouraged\add*. Your servant¦133982 will go¦133983 and¦133984 fight¦133984 against this Philistine¦133987.”

\v 34 “Your servant¦134021 has been \add working\add* for his father¦134022 tending the flock,” David¦134015 \add ≈replied\add*. “\add Sometimes\add* a lion¦134025 or a bear has come and \add ≈taken\add* a sheep from the flock

\v 13 \add But\add* if \add *he's\add* planning evil for you, may Yahweh punish me similarly or even worse if I don't inform you, and send you away so you can leave in peace. And may Yahweh be with you just like he used to be with my father.

\v 16 \add ≈So¦135908\add* Yonatan made a \add ≈multi-generational\add* agreement with David, \add adding\add*, “And may Yahweh¦135915 \add ≈punish David's¦135913 enemies¦135917\add*.”
\p
\v 17 Then¦135920 Yonatan¦135921 got David¦135925 to promise again¦135920 because he loved him as much as he loved his \add ≈own life¦135931\add*,
\v 18 and \add *he\add* told him, “The¦135938 new moon¦135940 \add celebration\add* is tomorrow¦135939, and you'll be missed¦135941 because your¦135944 seat¦135944 will be empty¦135943.
\v 19 The¦135962 following day¦135957, go¦135949 to the place¦135952 where¦135953 you hid \add ≈before\add* and stay by the \add ≈big\add* rock¦135961.

\p
\v 24 \add ≈So\add* David¦136036 hid himself in the countryside¦136037, and \add at\add* the new moon¦136039 \add celebrations\add*, the king¦136041 sat¦136040 down to eat¦136046—

\v 27 \add ≈However,\add* the next day of the \add ≈celebration\add* when David¦136096 was still missing, Sha'ul¦136099 asked his son Yonatan, “Why didn't¦136105 Yishay's¦136110 son come to the meal yesterday¦136113 or today?”
\p
\v 28 “David¦136128 \add ≈begged\add* me \add ≈to let him go to\add* Bethlehem,” Yonatan answered¦136121.
\v 29 “He \add ≈requested\add*, ‘Please \add ≈release me\add* because our clan's sacrifice¦136139 will be in the city¦136142, and my brother has \add ≈told me to be there\add*. \add ≈So¦136135\add* now, if I've found¦136151 favour¦136152 in your eyes¦136153, please let me slip away and \add ≈go¦136136 to\add* see¦136156 my brothers¦136159.’ \add ≈That's why\add* he hasn't come¦136165 to the king's¦136169 table¦136168.”
\p
\v 30 Sha'ul¦136175 \add ≈was furious at\add* Yonatan and \add ≈yelled at\add* him, “\add You\add* son of a perverse¦136181, rebellious¦136182 woman!

It's to your \add ≈detriment\add* and to the shame of your mother's¦136195 nakedness¦136194,
\v 31 because as long as that son of Yishay¦136204 stays alive on this earth, you and your kingdom¦136212 will never be established¦136210. Now¦136216, send¦136214 \add men\add* and \add ≈arrest\add* him, because he's \add ≈on his way to the grave\add*!”
\p
\v 32 “Why should he be put to death¦136234?” Yonatan \add ≈retorted\add*. “What \add wrong\add* has he done?”
\p
\v 33 Then¦136238 Sha'ul¦136239 hurled¦136238 his spear¦136242 at him to \add ≈kill him\add*, and Yonatan¦136246 knew \add then\add* that his father¦136252 had \add already\add* \add ≈determined¦136249 to kill\add* David¦136256.
\v 34 Yonatan angrily got up from the table¦136262.

\v 35 \add ≈So it was that the following\add* morning¦136285, Yonatan went¦136286 out to the countryside¦136288 \add ≈at the time agreed\add* with David¦136290, taking a small¦136292 boy¦136291 \add with him\add*.
\v 36 “Run \add ahead\add*—find the arrows that I'm about¦136305 to shoot¦136305,” he told his boy. The boy ran and he shot the arrow to \add ≈go over his head\add*.
\v 37 The boy went¦136314 to where the arrow was, \add ≈but\add* Yonatan called¦136323 out, “Isn't the arrow \add ≈further past\add* you?”
\v 38 Then¦136333 he \add ≈added\add*, “\add ≈Hurry up! Don't mess around\add*.” \add ≈So¦136333\add* the boy¦136336 picked¦136342 up the arrow¦136347 and brought it back to his master¦136352,

\v 3 \add *They\add* camped at Hakilah hill (\add ≈opposite\add* Yeshimon) by the path, \add ≈but\add* David¦139304 stayed in the wilderness \add ≈when\add* he saw the Sha'ul¦139293 was \add ≈there trying to get\add* him.

\v 5 \add That night,\add* David¦139327 \add ≈moved out\add* and \add ≈got\add* to the place where Sha'ul had camped. \add *He\add* \add ≈could see where Sha'ul was sleeping\add*, along with Ner's¦139350 son Abner¦139347, his army commander¦139351.

\v 6 David¦139363 spoke to Ahimelek (the Hittite¦139369) and to Abishai¦139372 (son of Yoab's¦139377 brother¦139376 Tseruiah¦139375) \add ≈asking\add*, “Who'll go into the camp with me to Sha'ul¦139385?”

\v 8 Abishai¦139422 \add ≈whispered\add* to David¦139425, “Today God¦139427 has \add ≈arranged for you to defeat\add* your enemy¦139431. \add ≈So\add* please¦139435 let me pierce him now with the spear¦139436 \add ≈through him and\add* into the ground¦139437. \add ≈Only one strike will do it\add*—I won't¦139440 have to \add ≈strike him a second time¦139438\add*.

\p
\v 21 Sha'ul¦139738 \add ≈responded¦139737\add*, “\add Yes,\add* I've sinned¦139739. \add ≈Go home\add*, my son David¦139743.

\v 5 Isn't this the David¦140744 that when they dance¦140749 they sing,\x + \xo 29:5: \xt 1Sam 18:7; 21:11.\x*

\p
\v 6 \add ≈So\add* Achish¦140760 called¦140759 David¦140763 and told him, “As Yahweh¦140768 lives, \add ≈you've definitely been honest\add*, and \add ≈everything I've seen of your activities has been good\add*, because I haven't \add ≈seen you do anything wrong since the day you first arrived\add*. \add ≈However, these rulers don't¦140781 approve of you\add*,

\p
\v 8 “But what have I done?” David¦140814 \add ≈rebutted\add*. “What \add wrong\add* have you found¦140823 in your servant¦140824 from the day \add ≈I arrived at your place until¦140829 now\add*? Why can't¦140833 I come and fight¦140835 against the enemies¦140836 of my master¦140837 the king?”

\v 9 “\add ≈All I know¦140846, is that as far as I'm concerned you're as reliable\add* as a messenger¦140851 from God¦140852.” Akish \add ≈responded¦140842\add*. “Nevertheless, the Philistine commanders¦140854 have said, ‘He \add ≈can't¦140857 join our side\add* in the battle¦140861.’

\v 1 David¦140896 and his men¦140897 \add ≈got back\add* to Tsiklag \add ≈three days later\add* and \add found that\add* the Amalekites¦140901 had raided Tsiklag and \add ≈other parts of the southern Judean wilderness\add*. They had \add ≈attacked¦140909\add* Tsiklag then burnt \add ≈it down\add*,
\v 2 capturing the women¦140920 and children and everyone else. They¦140918 hadn't killed¦140929 anyone¦140930, \add ≈but\add* had taken¦140917 them away \add with them\add*,
\v 3 \add ≈so\add* when David¦140936 and his men¦140937 arrived at the town, wow, it¦140942 had been burnt \add ≈down\add* and their wives¦140944, and sons¦140945 and daughters¦140946 had been taken¦140947 captive¦140947.
\v 4 David¦140950 and his men cried loudly until¦140959 \add ≈they didn't¦140961 have the strength¦140964 to cry any more\add*.
\v 5 Ahinoam¦140972 (from Yezreel¦140973) and¦140974 Abigail¦140974 (Nabal's¦140976 \add ≈widow\add* from Carmel¦140977), David's¦140970 two¦140967 wives¦140968, had been taken¦140971 captive¦140971 \add with the others\add*.\x + \xo 30:5: \xt 1Sam 25:42-43.\x*
\p
\v 6 David¦140980 \add ≈was in a tight spot\add* because the \add ≈men\add* \add were considering\add* \add ≈throwing rocks at him to kill him\add*, because they were very upset about their \add ≈children\add*, \add ≈but\add* \add *he\add* \add ≈found strength¦141002\add* in his God¦141005 Yahweh.
\v 7 Then David \add ≈asked\add* the priest¦141013 Evyatar (Ahimelek's son), “Please \add ≈get\add* the sacred apron \add ≈and come back to me\add*.” \add ≈So\add* Evyatar \add ≈got\add* the sacred apron \add ≈and went back\add* to David.\x + \xo 30:7: \xt 1Sam 22:20-23.\x*
\v 8 Then¦141031 David¦141032 asked Yahweh, “If I chase after¦141036 \add ≈these raiders, will I catch up to them\add*”
\p “Chase \add <them\add* because you'll definitely \add ≈catch up\add* and you'll certainly¦141046 \add ≈be able to rescue\add* \add <the captives\add*,” \add @Yahweh\add* \add ≈answered\add*.
\p
\v 9 \add ≈So¦141051\add* David¦141052 and the six¦141055 hundred¦141057 men who were with him \add ≈took off\add* and they reached the Besor¦141065 riverbed, \add ≈where some of the slower ones remained¦141067\add*.
\v 10 David¦141070 and four¦141072 hundred men continued, \add ≈but\add* two¦141077 hundred more of the men who were exhausted¦141080 \add ≈stopped\add* at \add the far end of\add* the Besor¦141085 riverbed.
\v 11 They found¦141087 an Egyptian man¦141088 in the countryside¦141091 and took¦141092 him to David¦141096. They gave¦141097 him \add ≈water¦141103 to drink¦141102\add* and bread¦141100 to eat,
\v 12 along with a slice¦141108 of fig¦141109 cake and two¦141110 raisin¦141111 clusters. He ate¦141112 it and \add ≈felt stronger again\add* because he hadn't eaten¦141119 or drunk¦141123 for three \add ≈full\add* days¦141126.
\v 13 “Who do you belong to?” David¦141133 \add ≈asked\add*. “And where¦141137 are you from?”
\p “I am an Egyptian,” he \add ≈replied\add*. “I'm an Amalekite man's slave¦141144 \add ≈but\add* my master¦141148 left me three¦141152 days ago because I got sick¦141150.
\v 14 We'd raided the southern area of the Kerethites as well as part of Yehudah¦141161 and the south of Caleb¦141165. And we burnt \add ≈down\add* Tsiklag¦141168.”
\p
\v 15 David¦141174 asked him, “Can you \add ≈lead us to them\add*?”
\p “I'll take you to \add *them\add*,” he answered, “\add if you\add* promise by God¦141183 that you won't \add ≈kill¦141186\add* me and won't \add ≈hand me back over to\add* my master¦141192.”
\v 16 \add ≈So¦141199\add* he took \add @David\add* down \add to the plain\add*, and \add ≈sure enough\add*, there were \add @the Amalekites\add* spread¦141201 out, eating¦141208 and drinking¦141209 and celebrating because of all the plunder¦141212 that they had taken from the Philistine and Yehudah¦141219 regions.
\v 17 David¦141222 \add ≈attacked¦141221\add* them from twilight¦141223 until the evening¦141226 of the next day¦141227, and none of \add @the Amalekites\add* were able to escape¦141230 except for four¦141236 hundred¦141237 young¦141240 men who \add ≈jumped\add* on camels¦141246 and fled.
\v 18 \add ≈So¦141249\add* David¦141250 was \add able to\add* rescue¦141261 everyone that the Amalekites¦141262 had taken¦141255, \add ≈including\add* his two¦141259 wives¦141260.
\v 19 \add ≈None¦141287 of their\add* sons¦141276 or daughters¦141277 were missing¦141265, and \add they¦141283 also recovered\add* \add all the animals and\add* all the plunder¦141278—nothing was missing—big or small¦141270.
\v 20 David took¦141289 all the flocks¦141295 and herds¦141296 and they drove¦141297 them in front¦141298 of the other livestock¦141299, saying, “This is David's¦141290 spoil.”
\p
\v 21 Then¦141306 David \add ≈got back\add* to the two hundred¦141310 men who'd been too exhausted¦141314 to go \add ≈all the way with them\add*. They'd stayed at the Besor¦141322 riverbed, and they went¦141306 out to meet David and his men. As David approached¦141331 to \add ≈greet\add* them,
\v 22 all the evil and worthless¦141347 men who'd gone with David¦141353 \add ≈complained\add*, “Because they didn't¦141357 go with us, we won't¦141357 give them any of the plunder¦141365 that we recovered¦141367, except that each man can get his wife and \add ≈children¦141378\add* then take them away and leave.”
\p
\v 23 “\add No\add*, my brothers¦141389,” David¦141384 said¦141383. “You won't¦141385 do that with what Yahweh¦141394 has given¦141393 to us. He's \add ≈protected\add* us and \add ≈helped us defeat the raiders who\add* came¦141402 against¦141403 us.
\v 24 Who'll listen¦141407 to you all \add ≈when you talk like that\add*? The portion for the ones who went \add ≈and fought\add* will be the same as for those who stayed with the equipment. They'll all \add ≈share alike¦141421\add*.
