\mt2 Paul's first letter to
\mt1 Timothy
\is1 Introduction
\ip Timothy was a Christian from Asia Minor. His mother was a Jew but his father was a Greek. When Paul saw Timothy's genuine faith, he accepted him as one of his companions and helpers at preaching and teaching the good message (Acts 16:1-3) and they had ended up in Ephesus together, where Paul left Timothy behind in order to look after the new believers there. After Timothy had been in Ephesus for some time, Paul sent this letter to him. Timothy's age was likely around thirty at that time.
\ip There seem to be three main purposes in this letter of Paul to Timothy:
\ip 1.) Firstly Paul warned him about false teaching that was affecting the assembly of believers there. This teaching contained the philosophies of both Jews and non-Jews, because according to them, this world that we live in is evil but a person can be saved if they have the correct wisdom or knowledge and doesn't eat certain types of food and doesn't marry. Paul writes that that's not right.
\ip 2.) This letter also teaches about the behaviour of the assembly of believers and about worship. Paul writes about the desired behaviour of teachers of the message, of helpers in the assembly, and of other believers including widows and slaves.
\ip 3.) Finally he advised Timothy how to become good servant of Yeshua the messiah, and concerning his responsibility to believers.

\v 3 When I was going¦137819 to Macedonia¦137821 I urged¦137814 you to remain¦137816 there in Ephesus¦137818 so that you could speak against those preaching a different¦137826 message
\v 4 and advise the believers not to worry about¦137836 myths¦137829 and endless¦137832 genealogies¦137831 which just result in \add useless\add* speculations¦137834 rather¦137837 than them using their faith¦137843 to advance God's plans.
\v 5 The outcome¦137846 of such teaching should be \add demonstrating\add* love¦137850 coming from a pure heart¦137853, a clean conscience¦137855, and selfless faith¦137858.
\v 6 Some others have deviated¦137862 from that, which¦137860 then results in useless¦137865 talk¦137865—
\v 7 they want to be religious teachers¦137868 but they don't¦137869 understand¦137870 what they're talking¦137873 about¦137875 or what they're agreeing¦137877 to.
\p
\v 8 But we¦137878 know that the \add religious\add* law can be good¦137881 if someone¦137885 is using it¦137886 lawfully¦137887,
\v 9 but other than that, we know that the law isn't¦137895 made for those who've been forgiven by God. The law was made for those who are disobedient and out of control, those who ignore and disobey God, who don't¦137895 honour him but rather profane¦137906 him, for those who would murder¦137912 their parents or other people,
\v 10 the sexually¦137913 immoral¦137913, homosexuals, kidnappers¦137915, liars¦137916, those who falsely accuse others¦137921 in court, and¦137918 those doing anything else that is against the sound¦137923 teaching¦137924
\v 11 that's part of the good¦137929 message¦137929 that honours the wonderful \nd God¦137934\nd* and which¦137935 was entrusted¦137936 to me.

\v 12 I'm thankful¦137939 for our¦137949 \nd master¦137948 Yeshua¦137946\nd* the \nd messiah¦137945\nd* for considering¦137953 me faithful¦137951 and strengthening¦137942 me, and then appointing¦137954 me to serve him
\v 13 even though I used to be a slanderer¦137962 and persecutor¦137964 and abuser¦137966,\x + \xo 1:13: \xt Acts 8:3; 9:1-30.\x* but I was shown¦137968 mercy¦137968 because¦137969 I did it¦137971 in unbelief¦137973 due to my ignorance.
\v 14 The grace¦137977 of our¦137980 \nd master¦137979\nd* so was generous in \add giving me\add* faith¦137982 in and¦137983 love¦137984 for \nd Yeshua¦137988\nd* the \nd messiah¦137987\nd*.
\v 15 This saying¦137991 is trustworthy and¦137992 worth¦137995 being accepted¦137994 by \nd everyone¦137997\nd*: \nd Yeshua¦137998\nd* the \nd messiah¦137997\nd* came¦137999 into this world¦138002 to save¦138004 sinners¦138003, of which I was the worst.
\v 16 And this is why I was shown¦138012 mercy¦138012: so that \nd Yeshua¦138019\nd* the \nd messiah¦138020\nd* can demonstrate his great patience¦138024 in me first¦138016 as a pattern¦138026 to all the others who will believe¦138030 in him¦138032 and obtain eternal¦138035 life¦138034.
\v 17 May the king¦138038 of the ages, the indestructible¦138041, invisible¦138042, only \nd God¦138045\nd* have all the honour¦138046 and¦138047 praise throughout all the ages. May it¦138054 be¦138054 so¦138054.

\v 19 maintaining your faith and your clear conscience¦138080 even though others have turned back and shipwrecked¦138087 their¦138085 faith,
\v 20 including Hymenaeus and¦138091 Alexander¦138092 who I put Satan¦138096 in charge of so that they'd be disciplined¦138098 to stop slandering¦138100.

\p
\v 1 Then first¦138103 of all I urge you all to pray for all people¦138112—petitioning \add to God\add* while also expressing thanks¦138109 for them.
\v 2 So too for \add ≈national¦138114 leaders¦138114\add* and other prominent¦138119 \add officials\add* so that we¦138126 can live a quiet¦138124 and tranquil¦138122 life with all devoutness¦138129 and dignity¦138131.
\v 3 This is good¦138134 and¦138135 pleasing¦138136 to \nd God¦138141\nd* our¦138140 saviour¦138139
\v 4 who wants everyone¦138144 to be saved¦138146 and¦138147 to know¦138149 the truth¦138150.\x + \xo 2:4: \xt Yhn 14:6.\x*
\v 5 There's only one God and also one mediator¦138157 \nd between¦138158\nd* God and humankind¦138160 and that's the man \nd Yeshua¦138163\nd* the \nd messiah¦138162\nd*
\v 6 who gave¦138165 himself¦138166 as a ransom¦138167 for all people and¦138170 as a testimony¦138172 \add of God's love\add* for all time.
\v 7 I was appointed¦138178\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 2Tim 1:11.\x* to proclaim¦138180 that message and as an missionary—no lies, I'm telling you the truth here in the \nd messiah¦138186\nd*—and also as a teacher¦138189 of knowledge¦138193 and the truth to non-Jews¦138190.
\p
\v 8 That's why I long to see men¦138201 praying¦138199 in every¦138203 country, lifting up their morally-clean hands¦138207 and¦138210 not harbouring anger¦138209 or disunity.
\p
\v 9 Similarly¦138213 women¦138216 should wear respectable¦138219 clothes¦138218 that are sensible and modest¦138221,\x + \xo 2:9: \xt 1Pe 3:3.\x* not with braids¦138229 or gold¦138233 or pearls¦138235 or expensive¦138238 clothing
\v 10 but¦138239 with what is fitting¦138241 for women¦138242 who do good¦138247 things, having declared that they honour God.
\v 11 Women should be learning¦138251 quietly¦138250 and submissively¦138254,
\v 12 but¦138265 I don't¦138260 permit¦138261 women¦138258 to be teaching¦138255 or domineering¦138263 men. They should remain quiet¦138268
\v 13 because¦138270 Adam¦138269 was created first¦138271, then Eve¦138274,\x + \xo 2:13: a \xt Gen 2:7; \xo b \xt Gen 2:21-22.\x*
\v 14 and it wasn't Adam¦138276 that was seduced¦138278 but rather it was the woman¦138281 that was deceived¦138282 and disobeyed.\x + \xo 2:14: \xt Gen 3:1-6.\x*
\v 15 But women will be saved¦138287 through¦138289 childbearing¦138291 if they¦138293 continue in faith¦138295 and love¦138297 and purity¦138299 and self-control.

\v 1 This is a trustworthy¦138302 saying¦138304: ‘If anyone¦138306 is aspiring¦138308 to be an overseer¦138307, then it's a good¦138309 task that he's desiring¦138311.’
\v 2 So¦138314 it's fitting¦138313 that an overseer¦138316 be above reproach,\x + \xo 3:2-7: \xt Tit 1:6-9.\x* be the husband¦138321 of one wife¦138320, sober¦138322, sensible¦138324, respectable¦138325, hospitable¦138326, a good teacher¦138327,
\v 3 not dependent on alcohol or greedy or a bully¦138331, but¦138334 rather gentle¦138335, peace-loving¦138336,
\v 4 a good, dignified¦138350 leader in his own home and in disciplining his children¦138344.
\v 5 (If someone¦138353 doesn't know how to lead his own household¦138356, how could he take care of God's assembly¦138361.)
\v 6 He mustn't be a new believer because that might lead him to becoming proud and from there to fall into the devil's¦138373 judgement¦138370.
\v 7 It's also fitting¦138374 for him to have a good¦138379 reputation with those outside¦138383 the assembly so that he doesn't end up getting mocked and from there falling into the devil's¦138392 trap.

\v 8 Similarly helpers in the assembly should also be dignified¦138395, should only speak the truth, shouldn't¦138396 be greedy¦138403 or addicted¦138401 to wine
\v 9 and should cling to the mystery¦138406 of the faith¦138408 with a clear conscience¦138413.
\v 10 Once they've proven themselves to be without any misconduct, them let them be working \add in the assembly\add*.
\v 11 Their¦138424 wives¦138424 too should be dignified¦138426, should only speak the truth, and should be sober¦138430 and faithful¦138432 in everything they do.
\v 12 These helpers in the assembly should be husbands¦138439 of one wife¦138438, and should lead their children¦138440 and their households¦138446 well.
\v 13 Those helpers who serve¦138450 well will earn a good¦138453 reputation for themselves¦138452 and¦138455 increase in confidence¦138457 in their faith¦138459 in \nd Yeshua¦138464\nd* the \nd messiah¦138463\nd*.

\v 1 But the \nd spirit¦138527\nd* is expressly¦138528 saying that in later¦138532 times¦138533, some will pull back from their faith¦138537, listening instead to deceiving¦138540 spirits¦138539 and¦138541 teachings¦138542 of demons¦138544.
\v 2 After suppressing their¦138550 own consciences¦138552, they'll become hypocritical¦138546 liars¦138547,

\rem /s1 Advice about Widows, Elders, and Slaves
\p
\v 3 Show honour¦138779 to widows—the \em real\em* widows that is
\v 4 because if a widow¦138786 has children¦138787 or grandchildren, then they should¦138791 be learning¦138791 to show their godliness to their own relatives first¦138792, and to be repaying their parents¦138801 \add and grandparents\add* because this is what \nd God¦138810\nd* expects.
\v 5 A woman¦138811 who is a real widow¦138814 and has been left by herself but puts her hope in God, she is then able to spend her days and nights¦138829 in prayer¦138828 and requesting God's response.
\v 6 But a widow who \add just\add* lives for pleasure is dead inside even though she's still living.
\v 7 You should teach these¦138839 things, \add Timothy\add*, so that the people don't anger God,
\v 8 because if someone is not providing¦138854 for their own household¦138852, then they've rejected their faith¦138857 \add in God\add* and they're acting worse¦138862 than an unbeliever¦138861.
\p
\v 9 The assembly should enrol¦138864\f + \fr 5:9 \ft It's not specified in the text what they were being enrolled for or into. It's likely that it was a list of widows visited and/or helped by the assembly.\f* widows sixty¦138868 years¦138867 old and over who was the wife¦138872 of a single husband¦138871.
\v 10 She should be known for her good undertakings, for example if she raised¦138878 children¦138878, if she was hospitable to strangers¦138880, if she washed¦138884 the feet¦138883 of believers, if she helped those who were oppressed¦138886, and if she always tried to do what was right.
\p
\v 11 But don't enrol younger¦138893 widows¦138895 because¦138898 their emotional needs might drive them to want to marry¦138903 again¦138901 rather than to serve the \nd messiah¦138902\nd*
\v 12 and we don't want them to be judged¦138906 because¦138907 they¦138911 couldn't fulfil their¦138908 faith¦138910 commitment.
\v 13 Plus they often follow others in idly going¦138917 around¦138917 houses¦138920, and not just being idle but¦138913 also gossipping¦138927 and meddling¦138929 and chatting about things they shouldn't¦138921.
\v 14 That's why I prefer younger¦138936 women¦138936 to be getting married and having children¦138938, to keep house¦138939, and to avoid all situations where others could accuse them.
\v 15 In fact, some have already¦138947 turned¦138950 away to follow Satan¦138954.
\p
\v 16 If any believing¦138959 woman¦138959 has widowed \add relatives\add*, they should¦138963 continue to help them and not burden the assembly, so then the assembly can assist¦138963 the really¦138972 \add needy\add* widows.

\v 17 An elder¦138978 who has led well should¦138981 be considered¦138981 worthy¦138981 of double¦138979 honour¦138980, especially those who work hard in studying and¦138987 teaching¦138988 the message¦138986,
\v 18 \x + \xo 5:18: a \xt Deu 25:4; 1Cor 9:9; \xo b \xt Mat 10:10; Luk 10:7.\x*because¦138990 the scriptures¦138992 say, “Don't muzzle¦138996 the ox working on the threshing¦138994 floor,” and¦138999 “A worker¦139002 deserves their wages.”
\v 19 \x + \xo 5:19: \xt Deu 17:6; 19:15.\x*Don't entertain an accusation¦139010 against¦139008 an elder¦139009 unless there are two¦139017 or three¦139019 witnesses¦139020,
\v 20 but the ones that are sinning¦139023 need to be scolded publicly so that others will be reluctant to do the same.

\v 22 Don't rush to lay hands on anyone¦139057\f + \fr 5:22 \ft Paul doesn't give more details here, and although Timothy probably knew what he meant, it's less certain to us now.

\p Those \add principles\add* are what you should¦139143 be teaching¦139160 and encouraging \add the believers to do\add*.
\v 3 If anyone¦139164 is teaching different¦139165 things and \add their living\add* is far from the message¦139171 of our¦139175 \nd master¦139174 Yeshua¦139176\nd* the \nd messiah¦139177\nd* and from godly teaching,
\v 4 that person is conceited¦139183. They don't know anything, but instead obsess¦139187 about debates¦139189 and quibble¦139191 about messages¦139191, and this leads to strife¦139196, slander¦139197, evil¦139199 suspicions¦139198,
\v 5 and constant¦139200 friction¦139200. People like this have ruined¦139202 their minds and been robbed of the truth¦139209, thinking¦139210 that they can gain financially by \add appearing\add* godly.
\p
\v 6 But \add genuine\add* godly living does lead to contentment¦139226 which is a big advantage,
\v 7 because¦139234 we brought nothing¦139227 with us into this world¦139232 and we can't take anything¦139237 out of it either.
\v 8 As long as we have shelter¦139243 and¦139242 sustenance¦139241, then we'll be content.
\v 9 Those who desire wealth fall into temptation¦139252. It's a trap which¦139261 leads to many foolish¦139258 and harmful¦139260 desires, resulting in people¦139264 sinking¦139262 into ruin and destruction
\v 10 because¦139270 that desire for wealth is the root of all evil¦139273. Some who aspired¦139279 to becoming wealthy wandered¦139280 away from faith¦139283 \add in Yeshua\add* and¦139284 wounded themselves¦139285 with many disappointments.

\v 14 to obey that command¦139354 faultlessly until¦139357 the return of our¦139362 \nd master¦139361 Yeshua¦139364\nd* the \nd messiah¦139365\nd*.
\v 15 He will be revealed in his own time—the blessed¦139371 and only God, the king¦139376 over all rulers and \nd Yahweh¦139380\nd* over all \nd masters¦139380\nd*,
\v 16 the only immortal¦139386 one who lives in unapproachable¦139389 brightness which no person has ever seen or is capable of looking at. He will be honoured¦139399 for his eternal¦139403 power. May¦139404 it¦139404 be so¦139404.
\p
\v 17 Command those who are rich in this present¦139409 age to not be proud and not to put their hope in uncertain¦139420 wealth, but¦139421 in \nd God¦139425\nd* who richly¦139435 blesses us with all that we need to be happy.
\v 18 They should live out goodness, doing good deeds, helping others and being¦139439 generous¦139445,
