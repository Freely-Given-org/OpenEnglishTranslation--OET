\mt2 Paul's first letter to
\mt1 Timothy
\is1 Introduction
\ip Timothy was a Christian from Asia Minor. His mother was a Jew but his father was a Greek. When Paul (Heb. Shaul) saw Timothy's genuine faith, he accepted him as one of his companions and helpers at preaching and teaching the good message (Acts 16:1-3) and they had ended up in Ephesus together, where Paul left Timothy behind in order to look after the new believers there. After Timothy had been in Ephesus for some time, Paul sent this letter to him. Timothy's age was likely around thirty at that time.
\ip There seem to be three main purposes in this letter of Paul to Timothy:
\ip 1. Firstly Paul warned him about false teaching that was affecting the assembly of believers there. This teaching contained the philosophies of both Jews and non-Jews, because according to them, this world that we live in is evil but a person can be saved if they have the correct wisdom or knowledge and doesn't eat certain types of food and doesn't marry. Paul writes that that's not right.
\ip 2. This letter also teaches about the behaviour of the assembly of believers and about worship. Paul writes about the desired behaviour of teachers of the message, of helpers in the assembly, and of other believers including widows and slaves.
\ip 3. Finally he advised Timothy how to become good servant of Yeshua the messiah, and concerning his responsibility to believers.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul, a missionary of Yeshua the messiah, \add appointed\add* by our saviour¦136844 god's command¦136842 and by Yeshua the messiah, who is our hope.

\s1 Staying on-track in faith and doctrine
\rem /s1 Warnings against False Teachings; Paul's charge to Timothy; Warning Against False Teachers of the Law
\p
\v 3 When I was going¦136879 to Macedonia¦136881, I urged¦136874 you to remain¦136876 there in Ephesus¦136878, so that you could speak against those preaching a different¦136886 message,
\v 4 and advise the believers not to worry about¦136896 myths¦136889 and endless¦136892 genealogies¦136891, which just result in \add useless\add* speculations¦136894, rather¦136897 than them using their faith¦136903 to advance God's plans.
\v 5 The outcome¦136906 of such teaching should be \add demonstrating\add* love¦136910 coming from a pure heart¦136913, a clean conscience¦136915, and¦136905 selfless faith¦136918.
\v 6 Some others have deviated¦136922 from that¦136920, which¦136920 then results in useless¦136925 talk¦136925—
\v 7 they want to be religious teachers¦136928 but they don't¦136929 understand¦136930 what they're talking¦136933 about¦136935 or what they're agreeing¦136937 to.
\p
\v 8 But we¦136938 know that the \add religious\add* law can be good¦136941 if someone¦136945 is using it¦136946 lawfully¦136947,
\v 9 but other than that, we know that the law isn't¦136955 made for those who've been forgiven by God. The law was made for those who are disobedient and out of control, those who ignore and disobey God, who don't¦136955 honour him but rather profane¦136966 him, for those who would murder¦136970 their parents or other people,
\v 10 the sexually¦136971 immoral¦136971, homosexuals, kidnappers¦136973, liars¦136974, those who falsely accuse others¦136979 in court, and¦136976 those doing anything else that is against the sound¦136981 teaching¦136982
\v 11 that's part of the good¦136987 message¦136987 that honours the wonderful \nd God¦136992\nd*, and which¦136993 was entrusted¦136994 to me.
\s1 Paul thanks God for showing mercy
\rem /s1 The Lord's Grace to Paul; Gratitude for Mercy; Paul's Gratitude for God's Mercy
\p
\v 12 I'm thankful¦136997 for our¦137007 \nd master¦137006 Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦137003\nd*, for considering¦137011 me faithful¦137009 and strengthening¦137000 me, and then appointing¦137012 me to serve him,
\v 13 even though I used to be a slanderer¦137020 and persecutor¦137022 and abuser¦137024,\x + \xo 1:13: \xt Acts 8:3; 9:1-30.\x* but I was shown¦137026 mercy¦137026 because¦137027 I did it¦137029 in unbelief¦137031 due to my ignorance.
\v 14 The grace¦137035 of our¦137038 \nd master¦137037\nd* was so generous in \add giving me\add* faith¦137040 in and¦137041 love¦137042 for \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦137045\nd*.
\v 15 This saying¦137049 is trustworthy and¦137050 worth¦137053 being accepted¦137052 by \nd everyone¦137055\nd*: \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦137055\nd* came¦137057 into this world¦137060 to save¦137062 sinners¦137061, of which I was the worst.
\v 16 And this is why I was shown¦137070 mercy¦137070: so that \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦137078\nd* can demonstrate his great patience¦137082 in me first¦137074, as a pattern¦137084 to all the others who will believe¦137088 in him¦137090 and obtain eternal¦137093 life¦137092.
\v 17 May the king¦137096 of the ages, the indestructible¦137099, invisible¦137100, only \nd God¦137103\nd* have all the honour¦137104 and¦137105 praise throughout all the ages. May it¦137112 be¦137112 so¦137112.
\rem /s1 Timothy's Responsibility
\p
\v 18 In line with previous prophecies¦137125, I'm entrusting¦137116 you, young Timothy¦137119, with this: fight in this battle for good¦137132,
\v 19 maintaining your faith and your clear conscience¦137138, even though others have turned back and shipwrecked¦137145 their¦137143 faith,
\v 20 including Hymenaeus and¦137149 Alexander¦137150, who I put Satan¦137154 in charge of, so that they'd be disciplined¦137156 to stop slandering¦137158.

\rem /s1 Instructions on Worship; Instructions concerning Prayer; Church Worship; Instructions about Worship; Christian conduct
\p
\v 1 Then first¦137161 of all I urge you all to pray for all people¦137170—petitioning \add to God\add* while also expressing thanks¦137167 for them.
\v 2 So too for \add ≈national leaders\add* and other prominent¦137177 \add officials\add* so that we¦137184 can live a quiet¦137182 and tranquil¦137180 life with all devoutness¦137187 and dignity¦137189.
\v 3 This is good¦137192 and¦137193 pleasing¦137194 to \nd God¦137199\nd* our¦137198 saviour¦137197
\v 4 who wants everyone¦137202 to be saved¦137204 and¦137205 to know¦137207 the truth¦137208.\x + \xo 2:4: \xt Yhn 14:6.\x*
\v 5 There's only one God and also one mediator¦137215 between¦137216 God and humankind¦137218 and that's the man \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦137220\nd*
\v 6 who gave¦137223 himself¦137224 as a ransom¦137225 for all people and¦137228 as a testimony¦137230 \add of God's love\add* for all time.
\v 7 I was appointed¦137236\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 2Tim 1:11.\x* to proclaim¦137238 that¦137234 message and as a missionary—no lies, I'm telling you the truth here in the \nd messiah¦137244\nd*—and also as a teacher¦137247 of knowledge¦137251 and the truth to non-Jews.
\p
\v 8 That's why I long to see men¦137259 praying¦137257 in every¦137261 country, lifting up their morally-clean hands¦137265 and¦137268 not harbouring anger¦137267 or disunity.
\p
\v 9 Similarly¦137271 women¦137274 should wear respectable¦137277 clothes¦137276 that are sensible and modest¦137279,\x + \xo 2:9: \xt 1Pe 3:3.\x* not with hair extensions or gold¦137291 or pearls¦137293 or expensive¦137296 clothing,
\v 10 but¦137297 with what is fitting¦137299 for women¦137300 who do good¦137305 things, having declared that they honour god.
\v 11 Women should be learning¦137309 quietly¦137308 and submissively¦137312,
\v 12 but¦137323 I don't¦137318 permit¦137319 women¦137316 to be teaching¦137313 or domineering¦137321 men. They should remain quiet¦137326
\v 13 because¦137328 Adam¦137327 was created first¦137329, then Eve¦137332,\x + \xo 2:13: a \xt Gen 2:7; \xo b \xt Gen 2:21-22.\x*
\v 14 and it wasn't Adam¦137334 that was seduced¦137336 but rather it was the woman¦137339 that was deceived¦137340 and disobeyed.\x + \xo 2:14: \xt Gen 3:1-6.\x*
\v 15 But women will be saved¦137345 through¦137347 childbearing¦137349 if they¦137351 continue in faith¦137353 and love¦137355 and purity¦137357 and self-control.

\s1 Qualities of assembly overseers
\rem /s1 Qualifications of Bishops; Overseers and Deacons; Leaders in the Church
\p
\v 1 This is a trustworthy¦137360 saying¦137362: ‘If anyone¦137364 is aspiring¦137366 to be an overseer¦137365, then it's a good¦137367 task that he's desiring¦137369.’
\v 2 So¦137372 it's fitting¦137371 that an overseer¦137374 be above reproach,\x + \xo 3:2-7: \xt Tit 1:6-9.\x* be the husband¦137379 of one wife¦137378, sober¦137380, sensible¦137381, respectable¦137382, hospitable¦137383, a good teacher¦137384,
\v 3 not dependent on alcohol or greedy or a bully¦137388, but¦137391 rather gentle¦137392, peace-loving,
\v 4 a good, dignified¦137406 leader in his own home and in disciplining his children¦137400.
\v 5 (If someone¦137409 doesn't know how to lead his own household¦137412, how could he take care of God's assembly¦137417?)
\v 6 He mustn't be a new believer, because that might lead him to becoming proud, and from there to fall into the devil's¦137429 judgement¦137426.
\v 7 It's also fitting¦137430 for him to have a good¦137435 reputation with those outside¦137439 the assembly, so that he doesn't end up getting mocked, and¦137431 from there falling into the devil's¦137448 trap.
\s1 Qualities of assembly helpers (or deacons/ministers)
\rem /s1 Helpers in the Church; Qualifications of Deacons
\p
\v 8 Similarly helpers in the assembly should also be dignified¦137451, should only speak the truth, shouldn't¦137452 be greedy¦137459 or addicted¦137457 to wine,
\v 9 and should cling to the mystery¦137462 of the faith¦137464 with a clear conscience¦137469.
\v 10 Once they've proven themselves to be without any misconduct, then¦137473 let them be working \add in the assembly\add*.
\v 11 Their wives¦137480, too, should be dignified¦137482, should only speak the truth, and should be sober¦137486 and faithful¦137487 in everything they do.
\v 12 These helpers in the assembly should be husbands¦137494 of one wife¦137493, and should lead their children¦137495 and their households¦137501 well.
\v 13 Those helpers who serve¦137505 well will earn a good¦137508 reputation for themselves¦137507 and¦137510 increase in confidence¦137512 in their faith¦137514 in \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦137518\nd*.

\v 14 I am writing¦137522 all this to you in the hope that I can come¦137524 soon,
\v 15 but¦137531 if I get delayed, at least you'll know how to organise God's household¦137538—that¦137541 is the assembly¦137545 of the living¦137547 God—which¦137541 is the pillar¦137548 and¦137549 foundation¦137550 of the truth¦137552.
\v 16 But¦137553 yes, this godliness is quite a mystery¦137560: he appeared¦137569 in a body¦137565, was declared innocent by the \nd spirit¦137568\nd*, was seen¦137569 by messengers¦137570, was preached among¦137572 the nations¦137573, was believed¦137574 in around the world¦137576, and¦137553 then¦137553 was taken¦137577 up \add to heaven\add* to be honoured.

\rem /s1 False Asceticism; False teaching; Instructions to Timothy; Warnings against False Teachers
\p
\v 1 But the \nd spirit¦137582\nd* is expressly¦137583 saying that in later¦137587 times¦137588, some will pull back from their faith¦137592, listening instead to deceiving¦137595 spirits¦137594 and¦137596 teachings¦137597 of demons¦137599.
\v 2 After suppressing their¦137604 own consciences¦137606, they'll become hypocritical¦137601 liars¦137602,
\v 3 telling people not to get married and¦137621 to keep away from foods¦137610 that \nd God¦137613\nd* created¦137614 for faithful¦137620 people who know the truth¦137624 to be able to eat with thankfulness¦137618.
\v 4 Every creature¦137627 made by \nd God¦137628\nd* is good¦137629 and¦137630 nothing¦137631 should be rejected¦137632 but rather be received¦137635 with thanksgiving¦137634

\v 6 If you explain these things to the believers¦137646 then you'll be a good servant¦137649 of \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦137650\nd*, growing in the messages¦137655 of faith¦137657 and of the good teachings¦137661 that¦137662 you have followed¦137664.
\v 7 Refuse to listen to rude jokes and¦137669 conspiracy theories. Instead train¦137674 yourself¦137676 to be godly,
\v 8 because¦137680 keeping fit is of some benefit, but being godly benefits every part of life, from the present¦137699 life right through to life in the next age.
\p
\v 9 Here is a trustworthy¦137703 saying¦137705 that's worthy¦137709 of acceptance¦137708 by everyone
\v 10 and it's what we work and strive¦137716 for: we have put our hope in the living¦137722 \nd God¦137721\nd* who is the saviour¦137725 of all people¦137727 and particularly of all believers¦137729,
\v 11 so command¦137730 and¦137732 teach¦137733 these¦137731 things.
\p
\v 12 Don't let anyone¦137734 despise you just because you're young, but¦137739 be an example¦137740 for the believers¦137743 in your¦137735 speech¦137745 and conduct¦137747, and in love¦137749, faith¦137753, and purity¦137755.
\v 13 Prioritise the public¦137760 reading¦137760 of the scriptures as well as encouraging and teaching¦137764 others until I come.
\v 14 Don't neglect¦137766 the gift¦137770 that¦137771 you have in you which¦137771 was given¦137772 to you when the council¦137782 of elders¦137782 placed their hands¦137779 on you and prophesied¦137775 over you.
\v 15 Keep these things in your thoughts so that everyone will be able to see your progress¦137791.
\v 16 Hold on to your own \add integrity\add* and to \add this\add* teaching¦137800, and stay faithful to them, because¦137804 as you do, you'll be saving¦137808 both yourself and the people listening to you.

\rem /s1 Advice about Widows, Elders, and Slaves
\p
\v 3 Show honour¦137833 to widows—the \em real\em* widows that is
\v 4 because if a widow¦137840 has children¦137841 or grandchildren, then they should¦137845 be learning¦137845 to show their godliness to their own relatives first¦137846, and to be repaying their parents¦137855 \add and grandparents\add* because this is what \nd God¦137864\nd* expects.
\v 5 A woman¦137865 who is a real widow¦137868 and has been left by herself but puts her hope in God, she is then¦137866 able to spend her days and nights¦137883 in prayer¦137882 and requesting God's response.
\v 6 But a widow who \add just\add* lives for pleasure is dead inside even though she's still living.
\v 7 You should teach these¦137893 things, \add Timothy\add*, so that the people don't anger God,
\v 8 because if someone is not providing¦137908 for their own household¦137906, then they've rejected their faith¦137911 \add in God\add* and they're acting worse¦137916 than an unbeliever¦137915.
\p
\v 9 The assembly should enrol¦137918\f + \fr 5:9 \ft It's not specified in the text what they were being enrolled for or into. It's likely that it was a list of widows visited and/or helped by the assembly.\f* a widow¦137917 if she's at least sixty¦137922 years¦137921 old and was the wife¦137926 of a single husband¦137925.
\v 10 She should be known for her good undertakings, for example if she raised¦137932 children¦137932, if she was hospitable to strangers¦137934, if she washed¦137938 the feet¦137937 of believers, if she helped those who were oppressed¦137940, and if she always tried to do what was right.
\p
\v 11 But don't enrol younger¦137947 widows¦137949 because¦137952 their emotional needs might drive them to want to marry¦137957 again¦137955 rather than to serve the \nd messiah¦137956\nd*
\v 12 and we don't want them to be judged¦137960 because¦137961 they¦137965 couldn't fulfil their¦137962 faith¦137964 commitment.
\v 13 Plus they often follow others in idly going¦137971 around¦137971 houses¦137974, and not just being idle but¦137967 also gossipping¦137981 and meddling¦137983 and chatting about things they shouldn't¦137975.
\v 14 That's why I prefer younger¦137990 women¦137990 to be getting married and having children¦137992, to keep house¦137993, and to avoid all situations where others could accuse them.
\v 15 In fact, some have already¦138001 turned¦138004 away to follow Satan¦138008.
\p
\v 16 If any believing¦138013 woman¦138013 has widowed \add relatives\add*, they should¦138017 continue to help them and not burden the assembly, so then the assembly can assist¦138017 the really¦138026 \add needy\add* widows.
\p
\v 17 An elder¦138032 who has led well should¦138035 be considered¦138035 worthy¦138035 of double¦138033 honour¦138034, especially those who work hard in studying and¦138041 teaching¦138042 the message¦138040,
\v 18 \x + \xo 5:18: a \xt Deu 25:4; 1Cor 9:9; \xo b \xt Mat 10:10; Luk 10:7.\x*because¦138044 the scriptures¦138046 say, “Don't muzzle¦138050 the ox working on the threshing¦138048 floor,” and¦138053 “A worker¦138056 deserves their wages.”
\v 19 \x + \xo 5:19: \xt Deu 17:6; 19:15.\x*Don't entertain an accusation¦138064 against¦138062 an elder¦138063 unless there are two¦138071 or three¦138073 witnesses¦138074,
\v 20 but the ones that are sinning¦138077 need to be scolded publicly so that others will be reluctant to do the same.
\p
\v 21 I am telling you these¦138101 things in the sight of \nd God¦138090\nd* and \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦138093\nd* and the chosen messengers¦138099 so that you can put them into practice without any favouritism or partiality¦138108.
\v 22 Don't rush to lay hands on anyone¦138111\f + \fr 5:22 \ft Paul doesn't give more details here, and although Timothy probably knew what he meant, it's less certain to us now. It probably refers to placing hands on others when praying for them, and could refer to praying for healing or similar, or praying for wisdom when dedicating a new leader. (TODO: Need to add cross-references here.)\f* and don't join in other people's sinful schemes, but \add strive to\add* keep yourself¦138117 pure.
\p
\v 23 Don't carry on just drinking¦138121 only water¦138121, because¦138126 a little¦138124 bit of wine might be good for your stomach¦138129 and help with your frequent¦138133 bouts of sickness¦138135.

\v 24 The sins of some people are quite¦138140 easy to see, being known ahead of them going¦138142 to face judgement¦138144, but other people's sins will only become known later.
\v 25 It's the same with people's good¦138156 deeds—some are quite¦138157 easy to see and¦138159 others¦138161 aren't¦138164, but nothing will be hidden¦138163 \add in the end\add*.

\p
\v 1 Those who are bonded into slavery¦138171 should¦138179 consider¦138179 their¦138173 masters¦138175 to be worthy¦138178 of honour¦138177, so that God's name¦138183 and¦138186 message won't¦138181 be slandered¦138189,
\v 2 and the ones having¦138193 masters who are \add also\add* believers shouldn't¦138196 despise¦138197 their masters because we're all brothers¦138199. On the contrary, let them serve \add well\add* because the ones benefitting¦138212 from their good work are beloved¦138208 believers.
\s1 Proper teaching and true contentment
\rem /s1 Final instructions; Love of Money; False Teaching and True Riches
\p Those \add principles\add* are what you should¦138197 be teaching¦138214 and encouraging \add the believers to do\add*.
\v 3 If anyone¦138218 is teaching different¦138219 things and \add their living\add* is far from the message¦138225 of our¦138229 \nd master¦138228 Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦138231\nd* and from godly teaching,
\v 4 that¦138247 person is conceited¦138237. They don't know anything, but instead obsess¦138241 about debates¦138243 and quibble¦138245 about messages¦138245, and this leads to strife¦138250, slander¦138251, evil¦138253 suspicions¦138252,
\v 5 and constant¦138254 friction¦138254. People like this have ruined¦138256 their minds and been robbed of the truth¦138263, thinking¦138264 that they can gain financially by \add appearing\add* godly.
\p
\v 6 But \add genuine\add* godly living does lead to contentment¦138280 which is a big advantage,
\v 7 because¦138288 we brought nothing¦138281 with us into this world¦138286 and we can't take anything¦138291 out of it either.
\v 8 As long as we have shelter¦138297 and¦138296 sustenance¦138295, then¦138294 we'll be content.
\v 9 Those who desire wealth fall into temptation¦138306. It's a trap which¦138315 leads to many foolish¦138312 and harmful¦138314 desires, resulting in people¦138318 sinking¦138316 into ruin and destruction
\v 10 because¦138324 that¦138331 desire for wealth is the root of all evil¦138327. Some who aspired¦138333 to becoming wealthy wandered¦138334 away from faith¦138337 \add in Yeshua\add* and¦138338 wounded themselves¦138339 with many disappointments.

\p
\v 11 But you¦138344, \add Timothy\add*, as a godly person¦138347, flee from those things and instead pursue¦138352 righteousness¦138354, godliness, faith¦138356, love¦138357, endurance¦138358, and gentleness¦138359.
\v 12 Fight the good fight¦138361 of the faith¦138366 in order to take¦138367 hold of the eternal¦138369 life¦138370 which¦138372 you were called¦138374 to when you confessed¦138376 \add wanting to follow Yeshua\add* in front of many witnesses¦138382.
\v 13 I am commanding¦138383 you¦138384 in front of \nd God¦138387\nd* who gave life¦138390 to everything, and¦138393 in front of \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦138394\nd* who testified¦138398 the good¦138403 confession¦138404 to Pontius¦138400 Pilate¦138401,\x + \xo 6:13: \xt Yhn 18:37.\x*
\v 14 to obey that command¦138408 faultlessly until¦138411 the return of our¦138416 \nd master¦138415 Yeshua¦138418\nd* the \nd messiah¦138419\nd*.
\v 15 He will be revealed in his own time—the blessed¦138425 and only God, the ruler over all rulers and \nd master¦138434\nd* over all \nd masters\nd*,
\v 16 the only immortal¦138440 one who lives in unapproachable¦138443 brightness which no person has ever seen or is capable of looking at. He will be honoured¦138453 for his eternal¦138457 power. May¦138458 it¦138458 be so¦138458.
\p
\v 17 Command those who are rich in this present¦138463 age to not be proud and not to put their hope in uncertain¦138473 wealth, but¦138474 in \nd God¦138478\nd* who richly¦138488 blesses us with all that¦138481 we need to be happy.
\v 18 They should live out goodness, doing good deeds, helping others and being¦138492 generous¦138498,
\v 19 thus they will be building themselves¦138500 a good¦138502 foundation¦138501 for the coming¦138505 age so that they may experience true life¦138511.
\rem /s1 Personal Instructions and Benediction
\p
\v 20 So Timothy¦138513, guard¦138517 what has been invested in you. Avoid useless and godless babbling¦138521 and what others call knowledge¦138526 but which opposes¦138523 the true message
\v 21 and which¦138527 some who were believers have turned away to.
\p May \add God's\add* grace¦138535 be with you¦138538 all \add there\add*.
