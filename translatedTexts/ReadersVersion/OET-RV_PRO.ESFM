\q1 ≈Don't reject¦269463 what your mother¦269465 has told you to do,
\q1
\v 9 because \add @their teaching\add* is like a graceful¦269470 garland to wear on your head,

\v 10 My child, if evil people tempt you¦269479 \add to join them\add*, don't¦269481 agree to it.

\q1 ≈Keep your¦269527 foot¦269527 away from their path¦269524

\q1 Listen, I'll pour my spirit out on you all.
\q1 Let me declare¦269608 my messages¦269609 to you all

\q1 ≈They'll search for me \add ≈but\add* won't be able to find me
\q1
\v 29 because they hated¦269661 wisdom
