\mt2 Paul's first letter to the believers in
\mt1 Thessalonica
\is1 Introduction
\ip Thessalonica was the capital city of the Roman province of Macedonia (and is now the large, modern city of Thessaloniki in Greece). Paul taught God's message there in Thessalonica after he left Philippi (Acts 17:1-4). Before long, there was disagreement from Jews upset about Paul's preaching to non-Jews (Acts 17:5-9). So Paul was forced to leave Thessalonica and he went on to Berea (Acts 17:10-13). Then after a while he went on to Athens (Acts 17:14-15). Finally, he continued on to Corinth (Acts 18:1-17). On his arrival there, he heard Timothy's account of his other work. He had been told by Timothy about the what the group of believers there in Thessalonica had been facing.
\ip Paul wrote this \bk First letter of Paul to the believers in Thessalonica\bk* in order to encourage and strengthen the believers there. He gave thanks for the account about their faith and their love. He also reminded them about the lifestyle that he demonstrated to them while he was still there with them. He answered questions again from the believers concerning the return of the messiah, and if the deceased believers would come back to life before the messiah returns. Paul used this letter to tell them it's necessary that they continue to work in their day-to-day jobs while they wait for the return of the messiah.

\p
\v 2 We \add here\add* are always thanking¦135281 \nd God¦135283\nd* for all of you and remembering¦135289 you in our¦135297 prayers¦135295—always
\v 3 remembering¦135299 before¦135320 our \nd God¦135322\nd* and father¦135324 about¦135301 your¦135300 striving for the faith¦135304 and the labour¦135307 of love¦135309 and the endurance¦135312 of the hope in our \nd master¦135316 Yeshua¦135318 Messiah¦135319\nd*.
\v 4 Brothers¦135327 and sisters, we know that you're all loved¦135328 by \nd God¦135331\nd*—the one who chose you.
\v 5 The good message \add that we brought\add* wasn't just any old message, but also comes in the holy \nd spirit¦135355\nd* with power¦135352 and with full assurance¦135359 \add of its truth\add*. You know how we lived among you because of \add our¦135340 concern\add* for you all,
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt Acts 17:5-9.\x*and then you¦135370 all imitated¦135371 both us and the \nd master¦135377\nd* after receiving¦135378 the message¦135380 in tribulation¦135382 with a lot of excitement about the holy \nd spirit¦135387\nd*—
\v 7 so much so that you¦135391 all became examples¦135392 to all the believers¦135396 in Macedonia¦135399 and¦135400 Achaia¦135403.
\v 8 So now the message¦135409 of the \nd master¦135412\nd* has been heard not only in Macedonia¦135417 and¦135418 Achaia¦135421, but¦135422 in every¦135425 place¦135426 where your¦135429 faith¦135428 towards¦135431 \nd God¦135433\nd* has been seen—so that now we don't¦135413 even need to say anything¦135444.
\v 9 They've been reporting¦135450 back to us about kindly we were accepted by you all and how you all turned¦135459 from idols¦135465 to God, to serve the living¦135468 and true God
\v 10 and waiting¦135473 for his¦135476 son, Yeshua to \add return\add* from the heavens¦135479. Yeshua is the one that he brought back to life and who rescues¦135487 us from \add God's\add* severe¦135492 anger¦135492 which¦135493 is coming¦135494.

\p
\v 1 Brothers¦135498 and sisters, you yourselves¦135495 know that our¦135501 going to \add Thessalonica\add* wasn't wasted,
\v 2 \x + \xo 2:2: a \xt Acts 16:19-24; \xo b \xt Acts 17:1-9.\x*but after previously¦135511 suffering¦135511 and being mistreated¦135513 in Philippi¦135517, we spoke¦135518 boldly¦135518 \add at your place with God's help\add*, to tell you all the good¦135527 message¦135527 from God despite a lot of opposition \add there\add*.
\v 3 As we recommend \add a change in your lifestyles\add*, we don't¦135537 do it with deception¦135539 or impurity¦135542 or deceit¦135546,
\v 4 but since God has approved us and entrusted¦135553 the good¦135555 message¦135555 to us, that's what we talk about. We don't¦135558 aim to bring pleasure¦135561 to people¦135560, but rather to bring them to God—the one who approves our¦135569 \add inner motives\add*.
\v 5 As you all know, we never once came with a message¦135574 of flattery¦135575, nor did we come under¦135581 any pretenses¦135581 (\nd God¦135583\nd* is \add our\add* witness¦135584) trying to get anything from you,
\v 6 nor did we try to earn respect from people¦135588—neither¦135590 from you¦135593 all nor from anyone else
\v 7 even though we could request support as ambassadors¦135604 of \nd Messiah¦135603\nd*. But we became \add unsophisticated \add* among you, \add just\add* like children, or like a breast-feeding mother¦135615 who cherishes¦135616 her own children.
\v 8 So in longing¦135621 for you all like that, we were happy to share¦135626 with you all—not only the good¦135631 message¦135631 from \nd God¦135633\nd*, but also \add exposing\add* our own lives¦135638 because¦135639 you all became dear to us.
\v 9 Brothers¦135646 and sisters, you're remembering¦135644 our¦135649 work and the hardship¦135652 \add that we endured\add*, working¦135657 day¦135656 and night¦135653 so that we wouldn't burden¦135661 any of you as we proclaimed¦135664 good¦135669 message¦135669 from \nd God¦135671\nd*.
\p
\v 10 You're all witnesses¦135673, and \nd God¦135676\nd* also, as to how devoutly¦135678 and justly¦135680 and blamelessly¦135682 we¦135687 were to the believers¦135685,
\v 11 just as each one of you who's a father¦135695 to his own children¦135696 has known¦135689
\v 12 how to encourage and to console¦135701 \add them\add*. We testified¦135703 to you so that you all would \add live lives\add* worthy¦135709 of \nd God¦135711\nd*—the one who invited you into his kingdom¦135719 and to \add share\add* his honour.
\p
\v 13 We also never stop thanking¦135727 God that when you accepted God's message that you heard from us, it wasn't a message from humans¦135742, but truly¦135745 was a message from God who is working¦135752 in all of you who believed¦135757.
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14: \xt Acts 17:5.\x*Brothers¦135763 and sisters, you became imitators¦135760 of the \add other\add* assemblies¦135765 of \nd God¦135767\nd* in Yudea¦135772 which¦135768 are \add founded on\add* \nd Messiah¦135774 Yeshua¦135775\nd*. You all suffered¦135780 the same¦135779 things from your own countrymen that the \add strict\add* Jews¦135792 did to them.
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Acts 9:23,29; 13:45,50; 14:2,5,19; 17:5,13; 18:12.\x*They executed their¦135800 own prophets¦135802 as well as the \nd master¦135796 Yeshua¦135798\nd*. They drove us out, displeasing \nd God¦135808\nd* and contrary¦135814 to all people¦135813—
\v 16 forbidding¦135815 us from telling non-Jews¦135818 that they \add need\add* to be saved¦135821 so that they stay in their¦135825 sins¦135827, but¦135831 \add God's\add* severe¦135835 anger¦135835 will finish them off.

\p
\v 17 But we, brothers¦135842 and sisters¦135842, have been cut off from you for a while, but¦135841 only physically and not in \add our\add* hearts¦135851, in fact we long to see¦135857 you even more.
\v 18 We wanted¦135863 to come and see you all—I, Paul¦135870, even tried twice¦135874 to come—but Satan¦135879 held us back.
\v 19 Because¦135881 who is it that encourages and pleases us and that we can brag about? Won't it be you all there in front of our¦135882 \nd master¦135896 Yeshua¦135898\nd* when he \add returns\add*,
\v 20 because¦135905 you¦135904 all make us \add both\add* happy and¦135910 proud.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 3:1: \xt Acts 17:15.\x*When we could endure¦135916 it no longer¦135915, we were happy to be left alone¦135922 in Athens¦135921.
\v 2 We sent¦135924 Timothy¦135925, who's our¦135928 brother¦135927 and God's servant¦135930 in the \nd messiah's¦135941\nd* good¦135939 message¦135939, so that he could strengthen¦135944 you all and encourage you in your¦135953 faith¦135952
\v 3 so that no one will be upset by these¦135961 difficulties because¦135963 you¦135964 all know that \add God\add* has appointed¦135968 us for those.
\v 4 Also, when we were with you all previously¦135975, we told you that we were going¦135978 to be oppressed¦135979, and then it¦135982 happened as you know.
\v 5 So again when I could no longer¦135988 endure¦135989 it, I sent¦135990 \add Timothy\add* to find out about your¦135996 faith¦135995, just in case you'd been tempted by the tempter and¦136004 then our¦136010 work \add there\add* would have been wasted.
\rem /s1 Timothy's Encouraging Report
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 3:6: \xt Acts 18:5.\x*But now Timothy's¦136014 returned here to us, telling us the good news about your¦136029 faith¦136025 and love¦136028, and how you're always¦136036 mentioning¦136033 good \add things about\add* us and wanting to see us, just like we'd like to see all of you.
\v 7 So \add even\add* in our¦136059 distress and sufferings, we're comforted¦136046 by your¦136064 faith¦136065, brothers¦136048 and sisters¦136048
\v 8 because now we¦136069 can live \add happily\add* since you're all standing¦136072 firm in \nd Yahweh¦136075\nd*.
\v 9 We're not able to repay¦136083 God for the thankfulness¦136078 that we have about you, because we are certainly thrilled in God's presence because of you all.
\p
\v 10 Day and night we're strongly requesting \add God\add* that we'll be able to \add go and\add* see¦136107 you all again, and to \add teach\add* anything that's lacking¦136114 in your¦136108 faith¦136116,
\v 11 and that \nd God¦136121\nd* our father¦136123 himself¦136118 and our \nd master¦136127 Yeshua¦136129\nd* might¦136131 show us how we could get to you¦136137 all.
\p
\v 12 May the \nd master¦136142\nd* increase your \add numbers\add* and give you all an excess of love¦136147 towards each other and toward everyone¦136149, just like we also have toward all of you,
\v 13 in order¦136158 to strengthen¦136160 your¦136161 \add faith and make you¦136161\add* blameless¦136165 and spotless before¦136169 our father¦136173 \nd God¦136171\nd*, when our \nd master¦136179 Yeshua¦136181\nd* comes with all his¦136187 holy people. May¦136188 it¦136188 be¦136188 so¦136188.

\p
\v 1 So¦136191 finally¦136190, brothers¦136192 and sisters¦136192, you learnt from us about how to live in a way that pleases¦136212 \nd God¦136213\nd* as indeed you are. Now we are requesting you all, and we're instructing \add you\add* from the \nd master¦136199 Yeshua¦136200\nd* to do this even more,
\v 2 because¦136222 you all know the instructions that we gave¦136225 to you through¦136228 the \nd master¦136230 Yeshua¦136231\nd*.
\v 3 Because¦136233 this is God's will: that you all stay holy, keeping¦136242 away from all sexual¦136246 immorality¦136246,
\v 4 knowing¦136247 that each of \add your¦136250 bodies\add* is like a container that you¦136250 can fill with holiness¦136256 and¦136257 honour¦136259.
\v 5 Don't fill them with lustful passions¦136262 like those who don't¦136260 know \nd God¦136272\nd*,
\v 6 nor going¦136275 beyond¦136275 \add lusts\add* and exploiting¦136277 your fellow believers, because¦136284 \nd Yahweh¦136287\nd* is the one who avenges¦136285 all those things as we've told you before and testified¦136297 to you all.
\v 7 \nd God¦136303\nd* has not called¦136300 us to impurity¦136305 but¦136306 to holiness¦136308,
\v 8 so whoever rejects this is not rejecting a human¦136313 but¦136315 rejecting \nd God¦136317\nd*—the one who gives his¦136325 holy \nd spirit¦136324\nd* to you¦136329 all.
\p
\v 9 Then¦136332 concerning¦136331 brotherly¦136334 love¦136334, you don't need me to write about that because¦136342 you yourselves¦136341 have been taught by God to be loving¦136348 each other
\v 10 \add and\add* because¦136351 you're all already doing¦136352 it to the believers¦136358 all over Macedonia¦136364. But we advise you, brothers and sisters to do it even more
\v 11 and to make it your ambition¦136373 to live quietly¦136375 and to look after your own selves. Work with your own hands¦136384 as we instructed¦136388 you,
\v 12 so that you have a good attitude towards¦136393 \add non-believers\add* and so that you don't have any outstanding needs.

\rem /s1 The Lord's Coming; The Hope of the Resurrection; Christ's return; The Coming of the Lord
\p
\v 13 But we don't want you to be ignorant, brothers¦136406 and¦136406 sisters¦136406, about those who've died so that you won't¦136405 mourn like others who don't have any hope,
\v 14 because¦136423 if we believe that Yeshua died and came back to life, then we can also believe that \add when he returns,\add* Yeshua will be bringing¦136441 with him those who have died.
\v 15 \x + \xo 4:15-17: \xt 1Cor 15:51-52.\x*So this is what we're saying¦136447 in Yahweh's message¦136449: those who're still living¦136454 when the master \add returns\add*, we certainly won't¦136464 precede¦136465 those who've already died
\v 16 because there'll be an announcement from the archangel¦136476 and God's trumpet¦136479 \add will sound\add* and then the \nd master¦136471\nd* will come down from heaven¦136483 with a loud¦136473 shout. The dead¦136486 \add believers\add* in \nd Messiah¦136488\nd* will come to life again first¦136490,
\v 17 then we who are still alive will be pulled up into the clouds¦136503 together¦136498 with them to meet the master in the air, and from then will always¦136512 remain¦136496 with \nd Yahweh¦136507\nd*.
\v 18 So \add when someone dies,\add* comfort¦136518 each other with those truths.

\v 2 \x + \xo 5:2: \xt Mat 24:43; Luk 12:39; 2Pe 3:10.\x*because¦136540 you¦136542 already know that \nd Yahweh's¦136546\nd* day¦136545 will come like a thief¦136548 comes at night¦136550.

\v 9 \nd God¦136651\nd* hasn't assigned us to \add his\add* severe¦136654 anger¦136654, but¦136655 rather for obtaining salvation¦136658 through¦136659 our¦136662 \nd master¦136661 Yeshua¦136663 Messiah¦136664\nd*—
