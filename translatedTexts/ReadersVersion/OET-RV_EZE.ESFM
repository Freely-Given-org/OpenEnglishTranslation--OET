\is1 Introduction
\ip Yehezkel (or more properly ‘Yehezk'el’ which means ‘God/El will strengthen’, but called ‘Ezekiel’ in older English translations because Greek has no ‘y’ or ‘h’) was a priest in Yerushalem (Jerusalem). He was one of the many people who were captured by the Babylonian army and marched off to Babylon before Yerushalem was defeated in 586 B.C. So he lived in Babylon and became a prophet five years after he'd been exiled. His message was directed to the people exiled to Babylon as well as those back in Yerushalem. Yehezkel's account can be divided into six parts: 1. God's calling Yehezkel as a prophet; 2. warnings to the people there about God's coming punishment of them, and of the coming destruction of Yerushalem; 3. God's messages about the punishment of various nations who'd attacked Israel; 4. comforting Yisrael when enemies defeated Yerushalem, and a promise of a future, better life; 5. the defeat of all of Yisrael's enemies; 6. Yehezkel's description of a restored temple and of a nation that would return to living there.
\ip Yehezkel demonstrated a lot of faith, and his messages came as visions—many of which he had to act out. Yehezkel explained the importance of a new heart and spirit, and how it's necessary for each person to individually repent from their sins. He reveals Yisrael's hope of a new life. Then as prophet and priest, he greatly looks forward to a new temple with all the rooms that are necessary for the sacred services.

\p
\v 1 \add When I was\add* thirty¦333471 years \add old\add*, on July 5th, as I was \add ≈living with the other captives\add* by the Kebar¦333484 Canal, the skies¦333486 opened¦333485 and I saw¦333487 visions¦333488 from God¦333489.\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Rev 19:11.\x*
\p
\v 2 That was the fifth year¦333494 since King Yoyakin \add (Jehoiachin)\add* had been taken captive.\x + \xo 1:2: \xt 2Ki 24:10-16; 2Ch 36:9-10.\x*
\v 3 Yahweh's message¦333502 came to \add me\add*, the priest¦333511 Yehezkel (son of Buzi¦333510) in the land of the Chaldeans \add (often known better as Babylonians)\add* by the Kebar¦333518 Canal, and Yahweh \add ≈revealed his strength to me\add* there¦333521.
\v 4 Then¦333526 I looked¦333526, and there was a windstorm coming¦333530 from the north¦333533—a huge¦333535 cloud with \add ≈lightning\add* flashing¦333537 inside it and \add ≈brilliant light\add* inside it and surrounding it, and fire inside the cloud \add ≈made it look\add* amber¦333543 coloured.
\v 5 In the middle \add ≈was what seemed to be\add* four¦333549 living¦333550 creatures¦333550 resembling humans¦333554,\x + \xo 1:5: \xt Rev 4:6.\x*
\v 6 \add ≈but\add* each of them had four faces¦333558 and four wings¦333561.
\v 7 Their legs were straight¦333567, but they had hooves like calves' hooves that gleamed¦333574 like polished bronze¦333575.
\v 8 They had human¦333580 hands¦333578 under¦333581 their wings on each of their four sides¦333585. For each of the four of them,
\v 9 their¦333595 wings were touching¦333590 the wings of the next creature, and they didn't¦333596 turn as they went—rather each one went straight forward.
\p
\v 10 Each one's \add front\add* face¦333608 was like a human¦333610 face, then they each had a lion's face on the right¦333615, a calf's face on the left, and the fourth \add face\add* was an eagle's¦333624 face.\x + \xo 1:10: \xt Ezr 1:5,10; 10:4; Eze 10:14; Rev 4:7.\x*
\v 11 Their faces¦333627 were like that, and their wings were spread¦333629 out above, so that each creature had a pair of wings that touched¦333633 another creature's wings, and also a pair that covered¦333636 their bodies¦333638.
\v 12 Each went straight forward, so that wherever¦333648 the spirit¦333652 directed them to go, they went without turning.
\p
\v 13 The living creatures \add ≈resembled\add* burning¦333665 coals¦333662 \add ≈or\add* torches¦333667. Bright fire also moved around among the creatures, and there were flashes of lightning¦333678.\x + \xo 1:13: \xt Rev 4:5.\x*
\v 14 The living¦333680 creatures¦333680 moved rapidly swiftly back and forth, and they¦333681 \add ≈looked a bit like\add* lightning¦333684.
\p
\v 15 Then¦333686 I looked¦333686 \add ≈more closely\add* and saw a wheel¦333689 on the ground beside¦333692 each of the living creatures with its four faces¦333695.\x + \xo 1:15-21: \xt Eze 10:9-13.\x*
\v 16 \add ≈Each of the wheels was the same, and they all shone like\add* chrysolite¦333701. \add ≈Each wheel seemed to have one wheel inside another\add* wheel.
\v 17 \add When\add* they moved, \add ≈they didn't¦333719 have to turn to change direction¦333716\add*.
\v 18 The rims \add @of the wheels\add* were \add ≈awesomely¦333726 tall\add*, and all four¦333732 of them were full of eyes¦333730 around¦333731 the rim.\x + \xo 1:18: \xt Rev 4:8.\x*
\v 19 Whenever the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside¦333738 them. When the living creatures \add ≈went upwards\add*, the wheels also went up.
\v 20 Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels went up beside them, because the spirit of the living¦333762 creature was in the wheels.
\v 21 Whenever the creatures moved, the wheels also moved, and when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still. When the creatures \add ≈went upwards\add*, the wheels went up beside them, because the spirit¦333776 of the living¦333777 creature was in the wheels.
\p
\v 22 Above the living¦333784 creatures was \add ≈something like an awesome¦333788 crystal¦333787 dome stretched out over their¦333792 heads\add*.\x + \xo 1:22: \xt Rev 4:6.\x*
\v 23 Beneath the dome, each of the creatures' wings stretched out straight¦333798 and¦333807 touched another creature's wings. Each \add *one\add* also had a pair to cover their¦333797 own body¦333812 with.
\v 24 Then¦333814 I heard¦333814 the sound of their wings, \add which was\add* like the noise of a lot of water¦333820. When they moved¦333825, it was like the voice¦333822 of the powerful \add one\add*—like the sound of a rainstorm¦333827 \add or\add* an army. Whenever they stood¦333830 still¦333830, they lowered their wings.\x + \xo 1:24: \xt Rev 1:4-15; 19:6.\x*
\v 25 Whenever they stopped¦333843 and lowered their wings¦333845, a voice came from under¦333837 the dome that¦333839 was above¦333840 their heads¦333842.
\s1 God's throne
\p
\v 26 Above the dome over their¦333852 heads¦333852 was \add ≈what looked like a sapphire¦333856 stone¦333854 that had been made into\add* a throne, and on the thing like a throne was \add ≈something that looked like\add* a man.\x + \xo 1:26: \xt Eze 10:1; Rev 4:2-3.\x*
\v 27 I saw a figure \add ≈that appeared to have\add* glowing metal with fire in it from his hips upwards, and \add ≈looking downwards from\add* his hips, I saw the appearance of fire and brightness all around.\x + \xo 1:27: \xt Eze 8:2.\x*
\v 28 The bright light surrounding \add @the throne\add* \add ≈looked like\add* a rainbow¦333894 in the clouds¦333897 on a rainy¦333899 day¦333898—it was the appearance of the likeness¦333906 of Yahweh's splendour. When I saw¦333910 it¦333896, I \add ≈quickly knelt down and bowed my head to the ground\add*, and I heard¦333915 a voice¦333916 speaking.

\s1 Yehezkel sent as a prophet to Yisrael
\rem /s1 Ezekiel's Call and Commission; Ezekiel's Call; The Vision of the Scroll
\p
\v 1 He said¦333920 to me, “Humanity's child, stand¦333925 up and then I'll speak¦333929 to you¦333930.”
\v 2 Then¦333932 as he spoke to me, the spirit¦333934 entered¦333932 into me and \add ≈stood me up\add*, and I heard¦333942 him speaking to me.
\v 3 He told me, “Humanity's child, I'm sending¦333953 you¦333955 to Yisrael's people¦333958—\add two\add* rebellious nations¦333962 that¦333964 have rebelled against me. Both they and their¦333969 ancestors¦333969 have been sinning against me \add ≈right up to this very moment\add*.
\v 4 Their descendants¦333978 \add ≈are very stubborn¦333981 and hardheaded\add*. I'm sending¦333985 you to them, and you'll tell them that this is what the master¦333992 Yahweh¦333992 is saying to them.
\v 5 They might listen¦333998 or might not. They're a rebellious¦334004 \add ≈bunch\add*, but they'll at least know¦334006 that a prophet¦334008's been among them.
\p
\v 6 And you, humanity's¦334016 child, don't¦334017 be afraid of them or their words. Don't be afraid, even though you're¦334032 among briers and thorns¦334027, and although you live with scorpions¦334031. Don't fear their words or be dismayed¦334041 by their faces, since they're a rebellious¦334044 \add ≈bunch\add*.
\v 7 \add ≈Pass my\add* messages¦334050 on to them, whether¦334052 they listen¦334054 or not, because they're \add quite\add* rebellious¦334059.
\v 8 \add ≈But\add* you, humanity's¦334066 child, listen¦334067 to what I'm telling you. Don't become rebellious like that¦334069 rebellious \add ≈bunch\add*. Open your mouth¦334082 and eat¦334083 what I'm \add about to\add* give you.”
\v 9 Then¦334091 I looked¦334091 and saw a hand¦334094 extended out to me, and \add ≈it was holding a scroll¦334100 with writing on it\add*.\x + \xo 2:9-10: \xt Rev 5:1.\x*
\v 10 He spread it out \add ≈in front of\add* me—there was writing on both the front and the back, \add ≈and it was full of messages about grief, mourning¦334114, and sad endings\add*.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 He said to me, “Humanity's child, eat what you've found. Eat this scroll¦334131, then go speak¦334134 to the \add ≈Israeli¦334137 people\add*.”\x + \xo 3:1-3: \xt Rev 10:9-10.\x*
\v 2 So¦334140 I opened¦334140 my mouth¦334143, and he gave¦334144 me the scroll¦334146 to eat.
\p
\v 3 He told me, “Humanity's child, feed your belly and fill¦334157 your stomach with this scroll¦334159 that¦334161 I've given you.” So¦334149 I ate¦334165 it, and it \add ≈tasted\add* as sweet¦334169 as honey¦334168.
\p
\v 4 Then he told me, “Humanity's child, go to the \add ≈people\add* of Yisrael¦334183 \add (Israel¦334183)\add* and \add ≈pass\add* my messages¦334185 on to them,
\v 5 because you aren't¦334189 being¦334198 sent to a people group \add ≈who speak\add* a strange or difficult¦334195 language, but to the \add ≈Israeli¦334202 people\add*—
\v 6 not to many people¦334208 groups \add ≈who speak\add* strange or difficult¦334212 languages whose words¦334218 you wouldn't be able to understand¦334217. \add ≈I'm sure that if it was them that\add* I sent¦334223 you to, they would've listened¦334225 to you.
\v 7 \add ≈But¦334228\add* the \add ≈Israeli people\add* won't¦334230 be willing to listen to you, because they're not willing to listen to me. All the \add ≈Israeli people\add* are \add ≈hardheaded\add* and hardhearted.
\v 8 \add ≈Listen, I'll enable you to be as stubborn and¦334261 tough as they are\add*.
\v 9 I'll make \add ≈you hard\add* like a diamond¦334268—harder than flint¦334270. Don't \add ≈be scared by\add* them or discouraged by \add ≈the looks they give you\add*, because they're rebellious¦334284 \add ≈people\add*.”
\p
\v 10 He \add ≈also\add* told me, “Humanity's child, \add ≈listen¦334304 very carefully to what I say\add*, and \add ≈keep thinking about it\add*.
\v 11 Then¦334306 go¦334307 to \add ≈any of your¦334314 people¦334314 who were brought here as\add* captives, and tell them, ‘This¦334322 is what the master¦334321 Yahweh¦334321 says¦334320,’ whether¦334323 they'll listen¦334325 or not.”
\rem /s1 Ezekiel at the River Chebar
\p
\v 12 Then¦334330 the spirit¦334331 lifted¦334330 me up, and¦334332 I heard¦334332 rumbling¦334335 like a large earthquake behind¦334333 me. (May Yahweh's \add ≈honour\add* in his place¦334341 be blessed¦334337.)
\v 13 It was the sound of the living¦334346 creatures¦334346' wings¦334345 as they touched¦334347 one another, and the sound of the wheels¦334353 that were with them, and the sound of a large earthquake.
\v 14 Then¦334359 the spirit lifted¦334360 me up and took¦334361 me away, and I went¦334362 with bitterness¦334363 and rage in my spirit¦334359, because Yahweh's hand¦334366 was pressing down firmly on me.
\v 15 Then¦334372 I went¦334372 to the captives at Tel¦334376-Abib who lived¦334378 along the Kebar¦334383 Canal, and I stayed among them there for seven¦334391 days¦334392, overwhelmed in amazement.

\rem /r (Ezekiel 33.1-9)
\p
\v 16 \add ≈After those seven¦334398 days¦334399 were over\add*, Yahweh¦334404 \add gave\add* me this message¦334402:\f + \fr 3:16 \ft This formula occurs around fifty times in Ezekiel's account.\f*
\v 17 “Humanity's child, I've made you¦334412 a \add ≈guard over the Israeli¦334413 people\add*, so listen¦334415 to \add ≈this message¦334417 of mine\add* and give¦334418 them my warning¦334418.
\v 18 When I tell the wicked, ‘You'll certainly die’ and you don't¦334426 warn them \add about that\add* or give them a warning about their evil actions so they might live—the wicked will die for their sin, but I'll \add ≈hold you responsible for their death\add*.
\v 19 \add ≈But¦334443\add* if you do warn the wicked, and they don't¦334448 turn from their wickedness or from their wicked actions, then they'll die¦334456 for their sin, but you will have saved your own life¦334460.
\p
\v 20 If a godly person turns¦334464 from their righteousness and behaves unjustly, and I set a stumbling¦334470 block¦334470 in front¦334471 of that¦334483 person, they'll die. Because you didn't¦334475 warn them, they'll die in their sin, and I won't¦334475 consider the righteous things they did, but I'll \add ≈hold you responsible for their death\add*.
\v 21 \add ≈But¦334489\add* if you warn the godly person to stop sinning so that they no longer sin, \add @that person\add* will surely live, since they were warned¦334503, and you will have saved your own life¦334507.”

\p
\v 22 Then Yahweh's hand¦334514 was on me there, and he told me, “\add ≈Get ready\add* \add and\add* go¦334520 out into the plain¦334523, and I'll speak¦334525 with you there.”
\p
\v 23 I \add ≈got up\add* and went¦334529 out into the plain¦334532 where Yahweh's glory was staying, like the glory I'd seen¦334542 beside the Kebar¦334547 Canal, so I fell \add ≈to my knees and bowed low to the ground\add*.
\v 24 Then¦334553 the spirit¦334556 entered¦334553 me and stood me up on my feet¦334560, and spoke¦334561 with me, telling me: Go and shut yourself¦334566 up in your¦334568 house¦334568.

\v 27 \add ≈But¦334601\add* when I speak¦334601 to you, I'll open your mouth¦334606 so you'll be able to tell them, ‘This is what the master¦334611 Yahweh¦334611 says.’ The ones who will hear will hear, \add but\add* the ones who won't listen won't listen, because they're rebellious¦334621 \add ≈people\add*.

\v 1 But you, humanity's¦334628 child, get yourself¦334631 a brick¦334632 and place it \add ≈in front of\add* you and carve Yerushalem¦334641 City on it.
\v 2 Then¦334643 lay siege¦334645 against it, and build¦334646 forts against it. \add ≈Build\add* an assault ramp up against it and make camps around it. Place battering¦334658 rams all around it.
\v 3 \add ≈After that,\add* get yourself an iron pan and use it as an iron wall between yourself and \add your representation of\add* the city¦334673, and \add keep looking in that direction\add*, because it'll be under siege and you're to put the siege against it. That will be a sign¦334683 to the \add ≈Israeli¦334685 people\add*.
\p
\v 4 Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the \add ≈Israeli¦334701 people\add* on it. You'll carry their¦334711 sin for the number¦334703 of days¦334704 you lie down \add as a sign\add* against them.
\v 5 I myself am assigning¦334714 to you one day to represent each year of their¦334719 punishment: 390 days¦334721 \add lying on your left side\add*. In that way, you'll carry the \add ≈Israeli¦334729 people's\add* sin.
\v 6 When \add ≈that period is over\add*, then lie down a second¦334744 time on your right¦334741 side, because you'll carry the sin of \add ≈Yehudah's¦334751 people\add* for forty¦334752 days. I'm assigning¦334758 one day to you for each year.
\p
\v 7 \add ≈Keep looking\add* towards Yerushalem¦334764, which is under siege¦334763, and with your arm bared¦334768 \add like a warrior\add*, prophesy¦334769 against¦334770 it¦334770.

\v 10 You'll measure 250g by weight¦334827 to eat each day, and you'll eat it during the day at set times.
\v 11 Then¦334837 you'll measure¦334838 out half a litre of water¦334837 to drink each day, and you'll drink it at set times.
\v 12 You'll \add cook and¦334851\add* eat¦334850 \add @that bread\add* as barley¦334849 cakes, but \add burn sun-dried\add* human¦334854 excrement¦334853 to bake it¦334855 over \add ≈while they're watching\add*.

\v 1 Then¦334953 you, humanity's¦334955 child, take a sharp¦334961 sword¦334960 as a barber's¦334963 razor¦334962 for yourself¦334965, and \add ≈use it to shave¦334966\add* your head and beard¦334972, then get \add some\add* scales \add ≈so you can\add* weigh¦334976 your hair and divide¦334977 \add *it\add* \add equally into three piles\add*.
\v 2 Burn a third of it in the middle¦334982 of the city when the days \add representing\add* the siege¦334986 have finished¦334984, and take \add ≈the second pile\add* of hair and hit it with the sword all around¦334993 the city. Then scatter \add the final\add* third to the wind, and I'll draw out a sword to chase after¦334999 the people.
\v 3 \add ≈But¦335001\add* take¦335001 a few hairs from them and¦335005 tie them into the folds of your¦335007 robe¦335007.
\v 4 Then¦335009 take \add a bit\add* more of the hair and throw¦335012 it into the middle¦335016 of the fire \add ≈to be burnt up\add*—from there a fire will spread out to all the \add ≈Israeli¦335030 people\add*.”
\p
\v 5 My master¦335035 Yahweh¦335035 says¦335034, “That \add brick model\add* is Yerushalem¦335038 where I've placed her in the middle¦335039 of the nations¦335040, and where I've surrounded her with other \add ≈countries¦335040\add*.
\v 6 \add ≈But¦335045 due to her wickedness¦335049,\add* she's rejected my decrees more than \add other\add* nations¦335052 have, and \add ≡avoided\add* my regulations more than the countries¦335058 that¦335059 surround her. Her¦335060 people have rejected my judgements and haven't \add ≈followed\add* my regulations.”
\v 7 Therefore my master Yahweh¦335076 says this, “Because you're more troublesome than the nations that surround you, and haven't \add ≈followed\add* my statutes or obeyed my regulations¦335085, or even acted according to the surrounding nations' regulations,”
\v 8 therefore my master¦335104 Yahweh¦335104 says¦335103 this, “Listen, I myself will work against¦335107 you. I'll execute¦335111 judgements¦335113 among you for the \add other\add* nations¦335115 to see¦335106.
\v 9 Because of your¦335135 detestable actions, I'll do things to you¦335118 that¦335120 I've never done before, and¦335124 which I'll never do again¦335131:
\v 10 Fathers will eat children among you, and sons will eat their¦335145 fathers¦335145, since I'll execute¦335146 judgement¦335148 on you and scatter¦335149 all of you who are left in every direction.”\x + \xo 5:10: \xt Lam 4:10.\x*
\p
\v 11 This is my master¦335165 Yahweh's declaration: As \add surely as\add* I live, it's certainly because¦335170 you've defiled my sanctuary¦335173 with all your hateful things, and with all \add ≈the disgusting things you've done\add*, that I myself will reduce you in number—\add ≈I\add* won't have pity on you, and I won't spare you.
\v 12 A third of you will die by plague¦335196, plus they'll be consumed by a famine¦335198 \add ≈that comes to you\add*. A third will die by \add ≈violence\add* \add in the area\add* surrounding you. Then I'll scatter a third in every direction, and draw out a sword to chase after¦335212 them as well.
\p
\v 13 Then¦335214 my \add ≈rage will be over\add*, and I'll \add ≈end\add* my fury at them. I'll be satisfied, and they'll know¦335220 that I, Yahweh¦335224, have spoken¦335225 in my rage \add ≈and\add* I've completed my furious \add punishment\add* of them.
\v 14 I'll make you into \add ≈a city of ruins so that¦335235 those from other nations¦335234 will mock you as they\add* pass by.
\v 15 So¦335242 Yerushalem will become something for other people to condemn and to mock—a warning¦335245 and a horror¦335246 to the nations¦335247 that surround you. I'll execute¦335250 judgements¦335252 against you in rage¦335256 and fury, and with an angry rebuke¦335255. I, Yahweh¦335258 have declared that.
\v 16 I'll send¦335261 out harsh arrows¦335264 of famine against you that¦335268'll become my way of destroying you, because I'll \add ≈make the famine more severe and destroy your food supply\add*.
\v 17 I'll send¦335285 a famine¦335287 and disasters against you so you'll be childless¦335290. Plague and bloodshed¦335292 will pass¦335293 through you, and I'll bring¦335297 a sword¦335296 against you. I, Yahweh¦335300, have declared that.\x + \xo 5:17: \xt Rev 6:8.\x*

\v 5 Then¦336457 he¦336458 spoke to the others¦336457 within my hearing¦336459, “Go through the city¦336461 after¦336462 him¦336462 and kill¦336463. Don't let \add ≈yourselves\add* have compassion¦336467, and don't¦336464 show any pity.
\v 6 Slaughter all the old men, young¦336475 adults, little¦336477 children¦336477, and women, \add ≈but\add* don't¦336490 approach anyone who has the mark on their head. Begin at my \add ≈sacred place\add*.” So they began¦336495 with the elders¦336497 who were in front¦336499 of the \add ≈temple\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add @Yahweh\add* told them, “Defile the \add ≈temple\add*, and fill¦336508 its courtyards¦336511 with the corpses. \add ≈Now go¦336513\add*.” So¦336502 they went¦336514 out and \add started\add* attacking the city¦336516.
\p
\v 8 As they were attacking it, I found myself alone, and I fell \add ≈to my knees with my head bowed down to the ground\add*, and cried¦336526 out, and said¦336527, “Ah, master¦336529 Yahweh¦336529, will you destroy¦336531 the entire¦336534 remnant¦336536 of Yisrael¦336537 \add ≈by pouring out\add* your rage on Yerushalem¦336544?”
\p
\v 9 “The disobedience of the \add ≈people\add* of Yisrael¦336551 and Yehudah has been \add ≈extremely bad\add*,” he answered. “The land is full of blood¦336558, and the city¦336559 full of perversions¦336561, since they say, ‘Yahweh has forgotten \add ≈this country\add*,’ and ‘Yahweh won't¦336569 \add ≈take any notice\add*.’
\v 10 So¦336573 then, \add ≈I won't show\add* compassion¦336578, and I won't spare them, rather I'll bring it¦336578 all on their heads¦336583.”
\p
\v 11 Then¦336586 wow, the man¦336587 dressed in linen¦336590 who had the writing¦336592 equipment by his side came back to report, saying, “I've¦336597 done everything you commanded¦336601.”

\p
\v 1 As I looked toward the dome that was over the heads of the winged creatures, something appeared¦336616 above them \add ≈that looked like a sapphire¦336615 stone¦336614 that had been made into\add* a throne¦336618.\x + \xo 10:1: \xt Eze 1:26; Rev 4:2.\x*
\v 2 Then Yahweh spoke to the man dressed in linen¦336628 and said, “Go between the wheels¦336634 underneath¦336637 the winged creatures, and fill both your hands¦336640 with fiery coals¦336641 from between the winged creatures and scatter¦336646 them over the city¦336649.”\x + \xo 10:2: \xt Rev 8:5.\x*
\p Then the man went in as I watched¦336651.
\v 3 The winged creatures stood on the right side of the \add ≈temple\add* when the man¦336658 went¦336657 in, and¦336659 a cloud¦336659 filled¦336660 the inner¦336664 courtyard¦336663.
\v 4 Yahweh's \add ≈brilliant light\add* rose up from the winged creature and stood over the threshold¦336673 of the \add ≈temple\add*. It filled¦336675 the \add ≈temple\add* with the cloud¦336679, and the courtyard¦336680 was full of the brightness¦336684 of Yahweh's splendour.
\v 5 The sound¦336688 of the creatures' wings¦336689 could be heard¦336691 as far as the outer¦336695 courtyard¦336694, like the voice¦336696 of the powerful God¦336697 when he speaks¦336700.
\p
\v 6 When \add @Yahweh\add* had commanded¦336703 the man dressed in linen¦336709, “Take fire¦336712 from between the wheels that are between the winged creatures,” the man went in and stood¦336718 beside¦336719 a wheel.
\v 7 A winged creature reached out his hand¦336726 between¦336733 the winged creatures to the fire¦336731 that¦336732 was among¦336727 \add *them\add*, and lifted it up and placed it into the hands¦336739 of the one dressed in linen¦336741. The man¦336740 took it and went¦336743 back out.
\p
\v 8 I \add ≈noticed\add* that the winged creatures had something like a human¦336750 hand¦336748 under¦336751 their¦336752 wings¦336752,
\v 9 then I looked¦336754, and wow, four¦336756 wheels were beside the winged creatures—one wheel beside each \add *one\add*—and the wheels seemed like shining chrysolite¦336774.\x + \xo 10:9-13: \xt Eze 1:15-21.\x*
\v 10 \add *They\add* all appeared¦336776 to be the same, like having a wheel within a wheel.
\v 11 When they moved, they went in any of their¦336790 four directions, without turning as they went, because whatever direction the head faced, they went in that¦336797 direction without turning as they went.
\v 12 Their¦336817 whole body¦336809 (including their backs¦336810, their hands¦336811, and their wings¦336812) was covered with eyes, and there were eyes all around¦336816 the four wheels, covering them as well.\x + \xo 10:12: \xt Rev 4:8.\x*
\v 13 I heard \add someone\add* call them ‘the whirling wheels¦336820’.
\p
\v 14 Each one had four faces¦336827: the first face was a winged creature's face, the second¦336834 was a human face, the third¦336837 was a lion's face, and the fourth¦336840 was an eagle's¦336843 face.\x + \xo 10:14: \xt Eze 1:10; Rev 4:7.\x*
\v 15 Then¦336845 the living¦336848 creatures (they were the same ones I'd¦336850 seen¦336850 by the Kebar¦336853 Canal) rose up \add in the air\add*.
\v 16 Whenever the winged creatures moved, the wheels would go beside them, and whenever the winged creatures lifted¦336860 up their¦336864 wings¦336864 to take off from the earth¦336867, the wheels didn't¦336868 turn—they still stayed beside them.
\v 17 When the winged creatures stood still, the wheels stood still, and when they went up, the wheels went up with them, because the spirit¦336883 of the living¦336884 creature was in the wheels.
\p
\v 18 Then¦336887 Yahweh's¦336889 \add ≈brilliant light\add* went¦336887 out over the \add ≈temple\add* threshold¦336891 and¦336893 stayed over the winged creatures.
\v 19 The winged creatures lifted¦336898 up their¦336902 wings¦336902 and rose from the ground in my sight when they¦336908 travelled¦336908, and the wheels¦336909 did the same beside them. They stood at the eastern¦336917 entrance¦336912 to Yahweh's residence, and the \add ≈brilliant light\add* of Yisrael's god¦336919 came onto them from above¦336923.
\v 20 Those were the living¦336926 creatures that I'd seen¦336928 below Yisrael's god¦336930 by the Kebar¦336935 Canal, so I knew¦336936 that they¦336939 were winged creatures.
\p
\v 21 They each had four faces¦336943 and four wings, and had something like human¦336950 hands¦336949 under¦336951 their¦336952 wings,

\p
\v 2 \add @Yahweh\add* told me, “Humanity's¦337014 child, these¦337017 are the men¦337018 who \add ≈plan to do evil¦337024 things\add* and who make wicked¦337020 plans in this city¦337025.

\v 4 So¦337042, prophesy against¦337040 them, humanity's¦337044 child, \add start\add* prophesying.”
\p
\v 5 Then¦337046 Yahweh's spirit¦337048 came on me and told me to say¦337052: This is what Yahweh says¦337055, “That is what you're all saying, \add ≈people\add* of Yisrael¦337060, because I know¦337064 what goes through your¦337062 mind.
\v 6 You've killed \add ≈many people\add* in this city¦337068, and¦337070 filled¦337070 its¦337071 streets¦337071 with them.
\p
\v 7 Therefore the master¦337079 Yahweh¦337079 says¦337078: The people you've killed, whose bodies you have laid in the middle of Yerushalem, are the meat, and this city is the pot. But you're all going to be brought out from the centre of this city.
\v 8 You've feared¦337094 the sword, so I am bringing¦337096 the sword upon you. That's my master¦337099 Yahweh's declaration.
\v 9 I'll bring you out from the city, and put you into the hands¦337107 of foreigners, because I'll bring judgement¦337112 against you all.
\v 10 You'll all fall by the sword¦337114. I will judge¦337120 you within Yisrael's border so that you'll all know¦337122 that I am Yahweh¦337126.
\v 11 This city won't¦337129 be your cooking pot, nor will you be the meat within her. I'll judge¦337142 you all within Yisrael's borders¦337140.
\v 12 Then¦337145 you'll all know¦337145 that I'm Yahweh¦337149, the one whose instructions you haven't \add ≈obeyed\add* and whose regulations¦337151 you haven't \add ≈followed\add*.

\p
\v 13 Then¦337163 as I was prophesying¦337164, Benayah's¦337168 son Felatyah died¦337169. \add ≈So¦337163\add* I fell \add ≈to my knees with my face¦337173 bowed low to the ground\add* and cried¦337174 out with a loud voice¦337175, “Oh no, my master¦337180 Yahweh¦337180, will you¦337183 completely¦337182 \add ≈eliminate the Israeli¦337186 people\add*?”

\p
\v 43 Because¦339596 you didn't¦339598 call to mind your younger days¦339604 and made me shake with anger because of all those things, therefore¦339615, listen: I myself will bring the punishment for what you've done down onto your own head. That is the master¦339621 Yahweh's declaration.

\v 45 You are the daughter¦339644 of your mother, who detested her husband and her children, and you are the sister of your sisters who detested their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite¦339659, and your father¦339660 was an Amorite¦339661.

\v 49 Listen, your¦339718 sister¦339718 Sodom's¦339717 sin was that she¦339733 was arrogant in her¦339727 leisure, careless and unconcerned about anything. She didn't¦339732 \add ≈assist\add* the poor and needy¦339731 people.
\v 50 She was arrogant and committed disgusting actions \add ≈in front of\add* me, so I took them away just as you have seen.

\v 3 Tell \add >them\add*, ‘The master¦339989 Yahweh¦339989 says¦339987 this: ‘A large eagle¦339991 with large wings¦339994 full of multi-coloured feathers¦339996, and long¦339995 pinions, went¦340003 to Lebanon¦340006 and grabbed hold of the top of a cedar¦340011 tree.
\v 4 He broke the top shoot¦340015 of \add @the tree\add* off, and took it to Canaan \add where he\add* placed it in a city¦340022 \add full\add* of merchants¦340021.
\v 5 He \add ≈also\add* took¦340026 some of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil, \add ≈beside a large body of water¦340036 where\add* a willow¦340038 \add might grow\add*.
\v 6 Then¦340041 \add @the seed\add* sprouted¦340041 and became a spreading vine low to the ground. Its branches turned¦340047 toward him, and its roots¦340050 grew \add ≈down below\add*, so it became a vine and produced¦340055 branches and sent out shoots¦340056.
\p
\v 7 \add ≈But¦340060\add* there was another large eagle with large wings¦340066 and many feathers. Oh wow, that vine¦340071 turned its roots¦340074 toward this eagle, and it spread out its branches¦340076 toward the eagle from the place it had been planted¦340083 so it might get watered¦340080.
\v 8 It had been planted¦340094 in good¦340088 soil beside a large body of water¦340091 so it would grow branches¦340096 and produce fruit¦340098, to become a magnificent vine¦340100.’

\v 9 \add ≈Ask\add* \add the people\add*: ‘The master¦340107 Yahweh¦340107 wants to know if it will prosper¦340109?

\v 11 Then Yahweh¦340157 \add ≈gave\add* me \add another\add* message¦340155:
\v 12 “\add ≈Ask\add* those rebellious¦340165 \add ≈people\add*, ‘Don't you know what those things mean? Listen, the king of Babylon came to Yerushalem¦340178 and took her king and her princes and took them with him to Babylon.\x + \xo 17:12-15: \xt 2Ki 24:15-20; 2Ch 36:10.\x*

\v 14 so the kingdom¦340207 would remain \add ≈subjected and not be able to become powerful again\add*. \add However,\add* by keeping the agreement, the \add ≈country\add* would \add at least\add* survive.
\v 15 But¦340217 the king of Yerushalem rebelled¦340217 against him by sending¦340220 his ambassadors¦340221 to Egypt¦340222 \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add* to acquire horses¦340226 and an army.

\v 16 This is the master¦340242 Yahweh's declaration: As I live he'll definitely die in the land of the king who made him king, the king whose promises he despised¦340252, and whose agreement he broke¦340257. He'll die in the middle of Babylon¦340264.

\v 21 All of his refugees in his armies will fall by the sword¦340344, and the ones who remain will be scattered¦340350 in every direction. Then¦340336 you'll all know¦340351 that I am Yahweh¦340354 because I've declared that that will happen.”

\v 24 They'll bring many people¦343583 against you with weapons¦343579, as well as chariots¦343580 and wagons¦343581.

\v 27 I will remove your shameful behaviour from you, and your acts of prostitution from Egypt. You'll \add ≈give up your longing looks towards them\add*, and you won't¦343632 think about Egypt any more,’

\v 29 They'll \add ≈show their hate for you as\add* they take¦343664 all your possessions and abandon you naked and bare—\add ≈yes,\add* your nakedness will be uncovered just like when you engaged in promiscuity and prostitution.
\v 30 These things will be done to you because of your acting like a prostitute—lusting after¦343681 nations¦343682 by which you became defiled with their¦343687 idols¦343687.
\p
\v 31 You \add ≈followed a similar path¦343689 to that\add* of your \add older\add* sister¦343690, so I'll \add ≈give¦343692 you¦343691 the same punishment that I gave her¦343693\add*.’
\v 32 The master¦343699 Yahweh¦343699 says¦343698 this, ‘You'll \add ≈suffer the same extreme suffering that your sister¦343702 suffered\add*. You'll become¦343706 a laughingstock¦343707 and a subject for derision¦343708—\add ≈there's a lot of pain coming your way\add*.

\v 10 Therefore the master¦347037 Yahweh¦347037 says¦347036 this: Because it was so tall, and it set its treetop between¦347047 its branches¦347048, and \add ≡because\add* it \add ≈grew proud¦347049\add* of its height¦347051,

\v 14 That happened so that no other trees that grow by the waters will raise up their¦347129 foliage to the height of the tallest trees, and that no other trees that grow beside the waters will reach up to that height.

\v 16 I brought shuddering to the nations¦347185 at the sound¦347182 of its downfall, when I threw it down to \add ≈the place of the dead\add*, along with those¦347191 who went down into the pit.

\v 17 They also went¦347214 down with \add @the big tree\add* to \add ≈the place of the dead\add*, to the ones who had been killed by the sword¦347220. Those were its strong arm—those¦347218 nations¦347225 who had lived in its shade¦347223.

You don't bandage up the ones \add ≈with broken limbs\add*, and you don't restore the outcasts or \add ≈search for those who've gone missing\add*. Instead, you use strength¦348562 and violence to rule over them.
\v 5 Then¦348587 they were scattered without a shepherd¦348589, and after they were scattered, they became¦348590 food for all the \add ≈wild animals¦348594\add* in the countryside¦348595.\x + \xo 34:5: \xt Num 27:17; 1Ki 22:17; Mat 9:36; Mrk 6:34.\x*

\p
\v 7 Therefore, you shepherds¦348621, listen¦348622 to Yahweh's message¦348625 \add to you\add*:
\v 8 This is the master¦348633 Yahweh's declaration: As I live, my flock has become plunder and food for all the wild animals¦348649 in the countryside¦348650 because there wasn't any shepherd and \add ≡because\add* none of my shepherds \add ≈tried to find any of\add* my flock \add that had gotten lost\add*. \add ≈Instead it was themselves¦348662 that\add* the shepherds looked after, and they didn't¦348637 shepherd my flock.
\v 9 Therefore, \add you ‘so-called’\add* shepherds¦348671, liste to Yahweh's message¦348673:
\v 10 The Lord Yahweh¦348680 says this: Listen, I'm against¦348683 those shepherds. I'll require \add ≈compensation from them for\add* my flock, and then I'll dismiss them from shepherding the flock.

\v 12 like a shepherd¦348725 searches for his sheep¦348732 when he's among his scattered flock. Thus I'll look for my flock and I'll rescue¦348739 them from all the places¦348743 where¦348744 they were scattered on the day of clouds¦348748 and darkness¦348749.
\v 13 \add ≈So¦348751\add* I'll bring \add @my people¦348754\add* out from among the \add ≈nations\add*.

\v 14 I'll put them in good pastures—Yisrael's high mountains¦348778 will be their¦348783 grazing places. They'll lie down there¦348784 in places good for grazing, in abundant pastures, and they'll graze¦348790 on Yisrael's hills.
\v 15 I myself will shepherd¦348797 my flock¦348798, and¦348799 I myself will make them lie down. That is the master¦348802 Yahweh's declaration.

\v 16 I'll search out the lost and restore the outcast. I'll bandage up those who are broken and heal those who are sick, but I'll destroy¦348825 those who are fat and well. I will shepherd with justice¦348827.
\p
\v 17 So¦348829 now this is what the master¦348833 Yahweh¦348833 says, You my flock¦348830, listen, I'll be a judge¦348836 between one sheep and another, and between rams and billy goats¦348842.

\p
\v 20 Therefore the master¦348874 Yahweh¦348874 says this to them: Listen, I myself will judge¦348880 between the fat sheep and the thin ones,

(It was six¦351621 long cubits—each long cubit was a cubit long plus a handbreadth¦351625.) \add ≈So¦351610\add* he measured the wall, and it was one measuring rod thick and one high.\x + \xo 40:5–42:20: \xt 1Ki 6:1-38; 2Ch 3:1-9.\x*
\v 6 Then¦351637 he went to the temple gate that¦351641 faced east. He went up its steps¦351646 and measured¦351648 the gate's threshold—one rod across.
\v 7 The guard chambers were each one rod \add ≈long and deep, and just under three metres¦351674 wide\add*. The temple gate threshold¦351675 by the temple portico was one rod across.
\v 8 He measured¦351684 the porch¦351687 inside¦351689 the gate and it was one rod long,
\v 9 and the porch over the gate was one rod deep. The doorposts were \add each\add* a metre wide. (This was the porch at the gate facing the temple.)
\v 10 There were three guard chambers on either side of the east gate¦351709, and each of them \add ≈was the same size\add*, and the walls that separated them \add ≈were the same size\add*.
\p
\v 11 Then¦351725 the man measured¦351725 the width of the gateway entrance \add ≈and it was five metres\add* and the length¦351734 of the gateway entrance \add ≈was almost seven metres\add*.
\v 12 He measured the wall that was \add ≈ran along\add* the front¦351741 of the chambers at half a metre high. The chambers measured three metres¦351753 on each side.
\v 13 Then¦351759 he measured¦351759 the gateway from the roof of one chamber to that of the next chamber \add ≈and it was thirteen metres¦351769\add*, from the entrance of the first chamber to that of the second.
\v 14 Then¦351774 he measured the wall that went between the guard chambers \add ≈and it was over thirty metres long\add* as far as the gate's porch.
\v 15 The entrance¦351792 from the front¦351796 of the gate to the other end of the gate's porch¦351797 was twenty-six metres.
\v 16 There were closed¦351804 windows facing the chambers and toward their¦351809 pillars¦351824 within the gates all around, and likewise for the porches. There were windows all around the inside, and each of the door jambs was decorated with \add carvings of\add* palm trees¦351825.

\p
\v 17 Then¦351827 the man brought¦351827 me to the outer¦351831 courtyard of the temple. Look, there were rooms, and the courtyard \add ≈was paved\add*, with thirty¦351840 rooms next to the pavement.
\v 18 The pavement \add ≈reached\add* to the side of the gates, and its width was the same as the gates' length¦351852. That was the lower¦351855 pavement.
\v 19 Then¦351857 the man measured¦351857 the distance from the front of the lower¦351861 gate to the front of the inner¦351864 gate: it was \add ≈just over fifty metres\add* on the eastern¦351868 side, and¦351869 the same on the northern¦351869 side.

\v 20 Then¦351871 he measured¦351878 the length¦351879 and width¦351880 of the gate¦351871 that¦351872 was at the northern¦351875 \add end\add* of the outer¦351877 courtyard¦351876.
\v 21 There were three chambers on each side of that gate, and the gate and its porch measured¦351893 the same as the main gate: \add ≈twenty-seven metres long and thirteen metres wide\add*.
\v 22 Its windows¦351904, porch, chambers, and its palm trees¦351908 matched the eastern¦351915 gate¦351911. Seven steps¦351916 went up to it and to its porch.
\v 23 There was a gate to the inner¦351927 courtyard¦351926 in front of the northern¦351930 gate, just as there also was at the eastern¦351931 gate. The man measured¦351932 from one gate to the other gate \add ≈and it was fifty-two metres\add*.

\v 24 Next the man took me to the gateway at the southern entrance, and its walls and porch measured¦351948 the same as the other outer gates.
\v 25 There were closed windows in the gateway and its porch just \add ≈like the other gates\add*. The southern gate and its porch \add ≈was twenty-seven metres long and thirteen metres wide¦351968\add*.
\v 26 There were seven¦351974 steps¦351973 up to the gate and its¦351975 porch, and \add carvings of\add* palm trees¦351980 on the walls on each side.
\v 27 There was a gate to the inner¦351993 courtyard¦351992 on the southern side, and¦351996 the man measured¦351996 fifty-four metres¦352004 from that gate to the gate at the southern entrance.

\v 29 Its chambers, walls, and porches measured¦352027 the same as the other gates—there were windows¦352029 all around in the porch. The inner gate and its porch \add ≈was twenty-seven metres long and thirteen metres wide¦352039\add*.
\v 30 There were also porches all around the inner wall—they were \add all\add* \add ≈thirteen metres long and almost three metres wide¦352052\add*.

\p
\v 38 There was a room with a door by each of the inner gateways which was where they rinsed¦352174 the burnt¦352177 offerings¦352177.
\v 39 There were two tables on each side of each porch, which¦352188 were for slaughtering¦352187 \add the offerings, i.e.,\add* the burnt¦352189 offering, the sin¦352190 offering, and the guilt¦352191 offering.
\v 40 By the wall of the courtyard, going up to the gate to the north¦352200, there were two tables. Also on the other¦352206 side there were two tables at the gate's porch.
\v 41 There were four tables by the gate¦352220 on each side—they slaughtered¦352224 animals on those eight¦352221 tables.
\v 42 There were four cut-stone tables for the burnt offerings, \add ≈each just under a metre long and width, and standing half a metre tall\add*. They kept the tools which they used to slaughter¦352248 the burnt offerings for the sacrifices¦352253 on those \add stone\add* tables.
\v 43 Some two-pronged hooks¦352255 a handbreadth in length were fastened all around in the porch, and the flesh¦352266 of the offerings¦352267 would be put on the tables¦352265.

\v 47 Next he measured¦352330 the square¦352341 courtyard¦352333 at 54m long and wide¦352338, with the altar¦352342 in front¦352343 of the temple.

\rem /s1 The Temple
\p
\v 48 Then¦352346 the man took me to the temple porch and measured¦352351 its doorposts—they were each 2.5m thick. The entryway itself was seven metres¦352355 wide,\f + \fr 40:48 \ft Following the LXX, as the 1.5m (three cubits) in the Hebrew appears likely to be a copying mistake.\f* and the walls on each side of it were 1.5m wide.

\s1 Inside the temple
\p
\v 1 Then¦352390 the man took me into the temple's holy place and measured¦352394 the doorposts \add at\add* three metres¦352400 thick on each side.
\v 2 The doorway was five metres wide \add and\add* the wall on each side was 2.5m long. Then¦352413 the man measured¦352425 the dimensions of the holy place—twenty-one metres long and ten metres wide.
\v 3 Then¦352433 the man went¦352433 into the \add very sacred\add* inner¦352434 place and measured¦352435 the door at one metre wide, and the doorway was three metres wide. The walls on either side were nearly four metres wide.
\v 4 Then he measured the square room's length¦352452 and width¦352455 of eleven metres, \add measuring\add* to the temple hallway. Then he said¦352462 to me, “This is the most sacred¦352465 area.”
\s1 The temple rooms
\rem /s1 The Rooms Built against the Temple Walls
\p
\v 5 Then¦352468 the man measured¦352468 the wall of the house at three metres thick. The width¦352474 of each side room around the house was two metres.
\v 6 There were side rooms on three¦352489 levels, one room above another, thirty¦352490 rooms on each level. There were ledges¦352492 around the temple wall to support all the side rooms, as the supports weren't built into the temple wall.
\v 7 So¦352510 the side rooms widened and went around going up, because the house went around higher and higher all around—the rooms widened \add ≈on each higher level\add*, and a stairway went up through the middle¦352538 level to the highest level.
\v 8 Then¦352540 I saw¦352540 a raised part all around the temple, the foundation¦352546 for the side chambers. It measured a full rod in height¦352542—\add ≈just over three metres¦352552\add*.
\rem /s1 The Building on the West
\v 9 The width of the wall of the side rooms on the outside was 2.5m. There was an open space¦352566 outside those rooms in the temple.
\v 10 On the other side of that open space were the priests' outer side rooms. That space was ten metres wide all around the temple.
\v 11 There were doors into the side rooms from another open space¦352585 with one doorway¦352590 on the north¦352589 side, and the other on the south¦352592. The width¦352593 of that open area was 2.5m all around.

\v 14 The width¦352642 of the front of the courtyard in front of the temple was also fifty-three metres.

\v 15 Then¦352650 the man measured¦352650 the length¦352651 of the building¦352653 behind the temple¦352668, to its¦352662 west, and including the galleries¦352662 on either side came to fifty-three metres.

\v 17 Above the entryway to the inner sanctuary and spaced along the walls there was a \add ≈repeating\add* pattern.
\v 18 It was decorated with winged creatures and palm trees¦352717—with a palm tree¦352718 between¦352719 each winged creature, and each winged creature had two¦352723 faces¦352724:
\v 19 the human¦352728 face looked toward a palm tree on one side, and the young¦352735 lion face looked toward a palm tree on the other side. They were carved all around the entire¦352743 temple.
\v 20 From the ground¦352750 to above the doorway, winged creatures and palm trees¦352756 were carved on the outer wall of the temple.
\v 21 The door posts of the \add ≈main temple room\add* were square¦352764, all with the same appearance.
\rem /s1 The Wooden Altar

\v 23 Both the main room and¦352795 the sacred place had double¦352792 doors¦352793—

\v 25 There were carvings of winged creatures and palm trees¦352817 on the doors¦352814, just like on the walls¦352820, and there was a wooden roof over the front porch.
\v 26 There were narrow windows¦352829 and palm trees¦352831 on either side of the porch like the side rooms¦352838 of the temple, and they also had overhanging roofs.

\rem /s1 Rooms for the Priests; The Holy Chambers and the Outer Wall; Two Buildings Near the Temple
\p
\v 1 Next the man sent me out to the outer courtyard on the northern side, and he brought¦352850 me to rooms in front of the outer courtyard and the northern outer wall.
\v 2 That building with a north-facing entrance¦352872 was fifty-four metres long and¦352874 twenty-seven metres wide.
\v 3 Some of those rooms faced the inner¦352882 courtyard and were eleven metres away from the sanctuary. There were three¦352894 levels of rooms, and the ones above looked down on the ones below and were open to them, having a walkway. Some of the rooms looked out onto the outer¦352887 courtyard.
\v 4 A five metre wide passage¦352898 ran in front¦352896 of the rooms and¦352908 was fifty-four\f + \fr 42:4 \ft The Hebrew text seemed to be missing a word here (as it didn't make sense), so the word from the (approx. 300 B.C.)

\v 5 But¦352911 the upper¦352912 halls were smaller, because the walkways \add ≈there used\add* more space than they¦352916 did in the bottom and¦352920 middle¦352920 levels of the building.
\v 6 \add @The third storey halls\add* had no pillars¦352929 (unlike the courtyards¦352930), so \add @the rooms at the highest level\add* were smaller than those on the bottom and middle¦352936 levels.
\v 7 The outside¦352942 wall ran along the rooms toward the outer¦352947 courtyard¦352946 that¦352940 was in front of the rooms \add and\add* was twenty-seven metres long¦352952.
\v 8 The \add row of\add* rooms along the outer¦352962 courtyard¦352961 was twenty-seven metres long, and¦352965 the \add row of\add* rooms facing the sanctuary was fifty-four metres long.
\v 9 There was an entrance to the lowest rooms from the eastern¦352979 side, coming from the outer¦352983 courtyard¦352982.
\v 10 There was \add also a set of\add* rooms¦352999 along the outer courtyard wall on the eastern¦352990 side of the outer courtyard, in front of the sanctuary's inner courtyard
\v 11 with a walkway in front¦353002 of them. They \add ≈looked similar to\add* the rooms on the northern¦353007 side and had the same \add ≈measurements\add*, as well as the same exits¦353012 and arrangements¦353013 and doors.
\v 12 There were also doorways into rooms on the south¦353020 side that¦353018 were similar¦353016 to what was on the north side. There was an inside passage with an outer door—the passage had doors into all the rooms. At the eastern¦353029 end of the passage there was a door from the outside.
\p
\v 13 Then¦353032 the man told me, “The northern¦353035 rooms and the southern¦353037 rooms that¦353038 are in front of the outer courtyard¦353042 are sacred rooms where¦353047 the priests¦353051 who work nearest to Yahweh¦353055 may eat the very sacred food. They will put the very sacred things there—the food offering, the sin offering, and the guilt¦353065 offering—because it's a very sacred area.
\v 14 When the priests¦353071 enter¦353070 it, they must not go¦353074 \add back\add* out of the sacred area to the outer¦353079 court¦353078, without laying aside the clothes in which they served¦353085, since those \add ≡clothes\add* are sacred.

\v 15 The man completed measuring the temple interior and then took me out to the eastern¦353113 gate¦353109 and measured all the surrounding area there.
\v 16-19 He measured each side \add of the wall\add* with \add &his\add* measuring rod \add and it was\add* 270m\f + \fr 42:16 \ft Following the Septuagint here, which seems more accurate (unless he now has a shorter measuring rod).\f* long on each of the eastern¦353121, northern, southern, and western side.
\v 20 \add ≈So\add* the four¦353168 sides¦353169 that were measured¦353170 (and thus the wall around it) was 270m on each side, and the wall separated¦353182 the sacred¦353184 area from the \add ≈public area\add*.

\v 2 Wow! The splendour of Yisrael's¦353200 god¦353199 \add ≈appeared to\add* the east. His voice¦353204 was like the \add ≈roar of rushing water¦353206\add*, and the land shone with his \add ≈brilliance\add*.\x + \xo 43:2: \xt Eze 10:3-4,18-19; 11:22-23; Rev 1:15.\x*

\v 5 Then¦353252 the spirit¦353253 lifted¦353252 me up and brought¦353254 me into the inner¦353258 court¦353257, and wow, Yahweh's¦353263 brilliance was filling the temple.
\v 6 Then¦353266 as the man¦353270 was standing¦353272 \add there\add* beside¦353273 me, I heard¦353266 someone speak to me from inside the temple
\v 7 and \add @the voice\add* told me, “Humanity's child, this is the place¦353311 \add where I'll sit on\add* my throne¦353283 and \add ≈rest\add* my feet¦353288—where¦353289 I'll live in the middle¦353293 of the Israeli¦353294 people¦353294 forever.

\v 8 They'll no longer profane my sacred name by putting their \add ≈entrance\add* next to my \add ≈entrance\add*, and their doorposts next to my doorposts, with nothing but a wall between me and them.

\v 9 Now let them remove their prostitution¦353341 and \add ?their kings' corpses¦353342\add* from before me, and I will live \add ≈among them\add* forever¦353347.
\p
\v 10 “Humanity's child, \add ≈describe that temple to the Israeli¦353357 people\add* so they'll be ashamed¦353363 of their¦353364 \add ≈disobedience\add* and \add ?≈consider those plans\add*.

\v 21 Then¦355202 he brought¦355202 me to the outer¦355206 courtyard and he led me past the four corners of that courtyard, and I saw that in every corner of the courtyard there was \add another\add* \add ≈enclosed area\add*
\v 22 that were each twenty-two metres long and¦355228 sixteen metres wide.
\v 23 Around the inside of each of those enclosed areas was a stone ledge, cooking hearths¦355241 \add all around\add* under¦355243 the ledge.
\v 24 The man told me, “Those are the places where¦355252 the temple workers will boil the people's¦355261 sacrifices¦355260.”

\v 1 Then¦355263 the man took me back to the temple entrance¦355266, and there was water flowing out from under the \add ≈front¦355278 edge of the building\add* toward¦355275 the east, and the water was flowing down the south side of the temple, to the right of the altar¦355288.\x + \xo 47:1: \xt Zech 14:8; Yhn 7:38; Rev 22:1.\x*
\v 2 So¦355290 he took me out through the northern¦355294 gate and led me around¦355295 \add the outside¦355297\add* to the eastern¦355304 gate, and look, the water¦355307 was flowing from this gate on its south¦355312 side.
\v 3 As the man¦355316 \add ≈started walking\add* toward the east holding his measuring line in his hand¦355319, he measured off five hundred metres¦355322 and led me through the water¦355324 which was ankle-deep.
\v 4 Then¦355328 he measured another five hundred metres and led me through¦355336 the water¦355331 which was \add now\add* knee-deep, and then after another five hundred metres it was then \add ≈up to the waist\add*.
\v 5 Finally¦355346 he measured¦355340 off another five hundred metres, but the water had become deep enough to swim in and too deep to cross¦355347—it was a \add now\add* river that¦355343 could not be walked across.
\v 6 The man \add ≈asked\add* me, “Humanity's child, \add ≈have you taken note of all\add* this?”
\p Then¦355360 he led me out and had me \add ≈return\add* along the riverbank¦355369.
\v 7 As I walked back, wow, \add now\add* the riverbank¦355376 had many trees on each side.
\v 8 The man told me, “This water \add ≈flows eastward and down into the Rift Valley\add*. \add *It'll\add* flow into the Dead Sea and will make it into fresh¦355402 water.
\v 9 \add ≈That will lead to\add* every kind of living creature¦355409 that swarms¦355414 living where that water flows. There'll be lots of fish¦355424 when that water flows \add @into the Dead Sea\add* as it causes the salty water to become¦355432 fresh¦355432 water—everything will live wherever that river¦355439 goes.
\v 10 Then¦355441 the fishermen¦355445 from Eyn-Gedi will stand \add there\add* by the water, and there will be a place¦355452 to dry out the fishing nets near Eyn-Eglaim. There will be many kinds¦355455 of fish in the Dead Sea—plentiful just like the fish in the Mediterranean Sea.
\v 11 \add However,\add* the Dead Sea's swamps and marshes¦355466 won't¦355467 be made fresh—they'll be for providing salt.
\v 12 Beside that river¦355474 on both banks¦355478, all kinds of fruit trees will grow.

\v 14 You are to equally divide¦355531 \add the land\add* that I \add ≈took action\add* to give¦355540 to your¦355541 ancestors¦355541—\add from now on\add* that land will come to you¦355545 all as an inheritance¦355546.

\p
\v 20 On the western side, the boundary¦355648 will be the Mediterranean Sea, \add north\add* to a point near Levo-Hamat¦355653.
\p
\v 21 This is how you'll all divide¦355659 this land for yourselves among Yisrael's tribes¦355665:
\v 22 You all must assign the land as a permanent possession for yourselves and also for any foreigners who are living and raising their children¦355679 among you. You all must consider them to be like native¦355683 born Israelis¦355684, and they must be assigned land among Yisrael's tribes¦355690.

\v 1 Here is a list of the tribes of Yisrael and the territory that each tribe is to receive. The northern boundary of Yisrael will start at the Mediterranean Sea and go \add east\add* to Hetlon \add city\add*, then to Levo-Hamat, and farther on to Hatsar-Enan, which is \add south\add* of Damascus¦355726, and it will continue to Hamat.

\s1 The chosen place
\p
\v 8 \add ≈South of\add* Yehudah's¦355828 land will be an area that¦355838 the entire¦355840 nation will give to me—you all will set it apart for special use. The temple will be in the centre of this area which¦355838 will be thirteen kilometres long (same as the other land allocations).
\p
\v 9 This special¦355859 area will be thirteen kilometres long and five¦355864 kilometres wide. That's what you'll all give to Yahweh¦355862.
\v 10 Within that special area, this is what will be allocated to the priests¦355876: you will assign them an area of land measuring thirteen kilometres on the northern¦355877 and southern¦355889 side, and five kilometres on the western¦355881 and eastern¦355885 sides. Yahweh's temple will be in the middle of that special area.
\v 11 The temple area will be for the priests¦355900, Tsadok's¦355903 descendants, who are dedicated to serving me. (They're the ones who served me faithfully and didn't¦355908 turn away \add from me\add* like the Levites¦355916 \add ≈and the others\add* did.)
\v 12 The \add ≈priests' allocation\add* will be a portion¦355922 of that very sacred¦355922 land, extending to the Levites' border¦355928.
\v 13 The land assigned to the Levites will be the same size as the land that the priests¦355934 will receive. (So¦355931 together, these two portions of land will be thirteen kilometres long and about ten kilometres wide.)
\v 14 They mustn't sell or barter it—none of this firstfruits of the land of Yisrael must ever be \add ≈used for any different purpose\add* because it's all sacred¦355965 to Yahweh¦355966.
\p
\v 15 Another strip of land thirteen kilometres long and almost three kilometres wide will be allotted for other people living in the special area to use. They may build homes and have pasturelands there, and there'll be a city in the middle¦355986 of that area.
\v 16 The city \add ≈will be square, over two kilometres long on each side\add*
\v 17 with an open area around it¦356020, within the special area, that will be about 130m wide in each direction.

\v 19 \add ≈Those¦356064 who come from the various tribes¦356063 to work in the city¦356060 may also work in this farmland\add*.
\v 20 That entire¦356076 special area, including the land given for Yahweh's use and the city¦356084, will be a square that is thirteen kilometres long on each side.
\p
\v 21 The tracts of land to the east and to the west of Yahweh's area and the city¦356096 will belong to the leader. One area will extend thirteen kilometres east to Yisrael's eastern¦356108 boundary, and the other will extend thirteen kilometres west \add to the Mediterranean Sea\add*.
