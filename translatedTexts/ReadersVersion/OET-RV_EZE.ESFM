\p
\v 1 \add When I was\add* thirty¦333471 years \add old\add*, on July 5th as I was \add ≈living with the other captives\add* by the Kevar Canal, the skies¦333486 opened¦333485 and I saw¦333487 visions¦333488 from God¦333489.\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Rev 19:11.\x*
\p
\v 2 That was the fifth year¦333494 since King Yoyakin \add (Jehoiachin)\add* had been taken captive.\x + \xo 1:2: \xt 2Ki 24:10-16; 2Ch 36:9-10.\x*
\v 3 Yahweh's message¦333502 came to \add me\add*, the priest¦333511 Yehezkel (son of Buzi¦333510) in the land of the Chaldeans \add (often known better as Babylonians)\add* by the Kevar Canal, and Yahweh \add ≈revealed his strength to me\add* there¦333521.
\v 4 Then¦333526 I looked¦333526, and there was a windstorm coming¦333530 from the north¦333533—a huge¦333535 cloud with \add ≈lightning\add* flashing¦333537 inside it and \add ≈brilliant light\add* inside it and surrounding it, and fire inside the cloud \add ≈made it appear as\add* an amber¦333543 colour.
\v 5 In the middle \add ≈was what seemed to be\add* four¦333549 living¦333550 creatures¦333550 resembling humans¦333554,\x + \xo 1:5: \xt Rev 4:6.\x*
\v 6 \add ≈but\add* each of them had four faces¦333558 and four wings¦333561.
\v 7 Their legs were straight¦333567, but they had hooves like calves that gleamed¦333574 like polished bronze¦333575.
\v 8 They had human¦333580 hands¦333578 under¦333581 their wings on each of their four sides¦333585. For each of the four of them,
\v 9 their¦333595 wings were touching¦333590 the wings of the next creature, and they didn't¦333596 turn as they went—rather each one went straight forward.
\p
\v 10 Their¦333616 faces¦333608 \add at the front\add* were like a man's face, then they each had a lion's face on the right¦333615, a calf's face on the left, and the fourth was an eagle's¦333624 face.\x + \xo 1:10: \xt Ezr 1:5,10; 10:4; Eze 10:14; Rev 4:7.\x*
\v 11 Their faces¦333627 were like that, and their wings were spread¦333629 out above, so that each creature had a pair of wings that touched¦333633 another creature's wing, and also a pair that covered¦333636 their bodies¦333638.
\v 12 Each went straight forward, so that wherever¦333648 the spirit¦333652 directed them to go, they went without turning.
\p
\v 13 The living creatures \add ≈resembled\add* burning¦333665 coals¦333662 \add ≈or\add* torches¦333667. Bright fire also moved around among the creatures, and there were flashes of lightning¦333678.\x + \xo 1:13: \xt Rev 4:5.\x*
\v 14 The living¦333680 creatures¦333680 moved rapidly swiftly back and forth, and they¦333681 \add ≈looked a bit like\add* lightning¦333684.
\p
\v 15 Then¦333686 I looked¦333686 \add ≈more closely\add* and then I saw a wheel¦333689 on the ground beside¦333692 each of the living creatures with its four faces¦333695.\x + \xo 1:15-21: \xt Eze 10:9-13.\x*
\v 16 \add ≈Each of the wheels was the same, and they all shone like\add* chrysolite¦333701. \add ≈Each wheel seemed to have one wheel inside the other\add* wheel.
\v 17 \add When\add* they moved, \add ≈they didn't¦333719 have to turn to change direction¦333716\add*.
\v 18 The rims \add @of the wheels\add* were \add ≈awesomely¦333726 tall\add*, and all four¦333732 of them were full of eyes¦333730 around¦333731 the rim.\x + \xo 1:18: \xt Rev 4:8.\x*
\v 19 Whenever the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside¦333738 them. When the living creatures \add ≈went upwards\add*, the wheels also went up.
\v 20 Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels went up beside them, because the spirit of the living¦333762 creature was in the wheels.
\v 21 Whenever the creatures moved, the wheels also moved, and when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still. When the creatures \add ≈went upwards\add*, the wheels went up beside them, because the spirit¦333776 of the living¦333777 creature was in the wheels.
\p
\v 22 Above the living¦333784 creatures was \add ≈something like an awesome¦333788 crystal¦333787 dome stretched out over their¦333792 heads\add*.\x + \xo 1:22: \xt Rev 4:6.\x*
\v 23 Beneath the dome, each of the creatures' wings stretched out straight¦333798 and¦333807 touched another creature's wings. Each \add *one\add* also had a pair to cover his own body¦333812 with.
\v 24 Then¦333814 I heard¦333814 the sound of their wings \add which was\add* like the noise of a lot of water¦333820. When they moved¦333825, it was ike the voice¦333822 of the powerful \add one\add*—like the sound of a rainstorm¦333827 \add or\add* an army. Whenever they stood¦333830 still¦333830, they lowered their wings.\x + \xo 1:24: \xt Rev 1:4-15; 19:6.\x*
\v 25 A voice came from under¦333837 the dome that was above¦333840 their heads¦333842, whenever they stopped¦333843 and lowered their wings¦333845.
\s1 God's throne
\p
\v 26 Above the dome over their¦333852 heads¦333852 was \add ≈what looked like a sapphire¦333856 stone¦333854 that had been made into\add* a throne, and on the thing like a throne was a \add ≈something that appeared to be\add* a man.\x + \xo 1:26: \xt Eze 10:1; Rev 4:2-3.\x*
\v 27 I saw a figure \add ≈that appeared to have\add* glowing metal with fire in it from his hips upwards, and \add ≈looking downwards from\add* his hips, I saw the appearance of fire and brightness all around.\x + \xo 1:27: \xt Eze 8:2.\x*
\v 28 The bright light surrounding \add @the throne\add* was like the appearance of a rainbow¦333894 in the clouds¦333897 on a rainy¦333899 day¦333898—tt was the appearance of the likeness¦333906 of Yahweh's splendour. When I saw¦333910 it¦333896, I \add ≈quickly knelt down and bowed my head to the ground\add*, and I heard¦333915 a voice¦333916 speaking.

\s1 The making to Yehezkel prophet
\rem /s1 Ezekiel's Call and Commission; Ezekiel's Call; The Vision of the Scroll
\p
\v 1 He said¦333920 to me, “Humanity's child, stand¦333925 up and then I'll speak¦333929 to you¦333930.”
\v 2 Then¦333932 as he spoke to me, the spirit¦333934 entered¦333932 into me and \add ≈stood me up\add*, and I heard¦333942 him speaking to me.
\v 3 He told me, “Humanity's child, I'm sending¦333953 you¦333955 to Yisra'el's people¦333958—\add two\add* rebellious nations¦333962 that have rebelled against me. Both they and their¦333969 ancestors¦333969 have been sinning against me \add ≈right until¦333972 this moment\add*.
\v 4 Their descendants¦333978 \add ≈are very stubborn¦333981 and hard headed\add*. I'm sending¦333985 you to them, and you'll tell them that this is what the master¦333992 Yahweh¦333992 is saying to them.
\v 5 They might listen¦333998 or might not. They're a rebellious¦334004 \add ≈bunch\add*, but they'll at least know¦334006 that a prophet¦334008 has been among them.
\p
\v 6 And you, humanity's¦334016 child, don't¦334017 be afraid of them or their words. Don't be afraid, even though you're¦334032 with briers and thorns¦334027 and although you live with scorpions¦334031. Don't fear their words or be dismayed¦334041 by their faces, since they're a rebellious¦334044 \add ≈bunch\add*.
\v 7 \add ≈Pass my\add* messages onto them, whether¦334052 they listen¦334054 or not, because they're \add quite\add* rebellious¦334059.
\v 8 \add ≈But\add* you, humanity's¦334066 child, listen¦334067 to what I am telling you. Don't become rebellious like that rebellious \add ≈bunch\add*. Open your mouth¦334082 and eat¦334083 what I'm \add about to\add* give to you.”
\v 9 Then¦334091 I looked¦334091 and saw a hand¦334094 extended out to me and \add ≈it was holding a scroll¦334100 with writing on it\add*.\x + \xo 2:9-10: \xt Rev 5:1.\x*
\v 10 He spread it out \add ≈in front of\add* me—it had been written on both the front and the back, \add ≈the contents were full of messages about grief, mourning¦334114, and sad endings\add*.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 He said to me, “Humanity's child, what you've found, eat. Eat this scroll¦334131, then go speak¦334134 to the \add ≈Israeli people\add*.”\x + \xo 3:1-3: \xt Rev 10:9-10.\x*
\v 2 So¦334140 I opened¦334140 my mouth¦334143, and he gave¦334144 me the scroll¦334146 to eat.
\p
\v 3 He told me, “Humanity's child, feed your belly and fill¦334157 your stomach with this scroll¦334159 that I've given you.” So¦334149 I ate¦334165 it, and it \add ≈tasted\add* as sweet¦334169 as honey¦334168.
\p
\v 4 Then he told me, “Humanity's child, go to the house¦334182 of Yisrael¦334183 \add (Israel¦334183)\add* and \add ≈pass\add* my messages on to them
\v 5 because you aren't¦334189 being¦334198 sent to a people \add ≈who speak\add* a strange or difficult¦334195 language, but to the \add ≈Israeli¦334202 people\add*—
\v 6 not to many peoples¦334208 \add ≈who speak\add* strange or difficult¦334212 languages whose words¦334218 you wouldn't be able to understand¦334217. \add ≈I'm sure that if it was them that\add* I sent¦334223 you to, they would have listened¦334225 to you.
\v 7 \add ≈But¦334228\add* the \add ≈Israeli people\add* won't¦334230 be willing to listen to you, because they're not willing to listen to me. So¦334228 all the \add ≈Israeli people\add* are \add ≈hard-headed\add* and hard-hearted.
\v 8 \add ≈Listen, I'll enable you to be as stubborn and¦334261 tough as they are\add*.
\v 9 I'll make \add ≈you hard\add* like a diamond¦334268—harder than flint¦334270 Don't \add ≈be scared by\add* them or discouraged by \add ≈the looks they give you\add*, because they're rebellious¦334284 \add ≈people\add*.”
\p
\v 10 He \add ≈also\add* told me, “Humanity's child, \add ≈listen¦334304 very carefully to what I say\add*, and \add ≈keep thinking about it\add*.
\v 11 Then¦334306 go¦334307 to \add ≈any of your¦334314 people¦334314 who were brought here as\add* captives, and tell them, ‘This¦334322 is what the master¦334321 Yahweh¦334321 says¦334320,’ whether¦334323 they'll listen¦334325 or not.”
\rem /s1 Ezekiel at the River Chebar
\p
\v 12 Then¦334330 the spirit¦334331 lifted¦334330 me up, and¦334332 I heard¦334332 rumbling¦334335 like a large earthquake behind¦334333 me. (Blessed be Yahweh's \add ≈honour\add* in his place¦334341.)
\v 13 It was the sound of the wings¦334345 of the living¦334346 creatures¦334346 as they touched¦334347 one another, and the sound of the wheels¦334353 that were with them, and the sound of a large earthquake.
\v 14 Then¦334359 the Spirit lifted¦334360 me up and took¦334361 me away, and I went¦334362 with bitterness¦334363 in my spirit's¦334359 rage, because Yahweh's hand¦334366 was pressing down firmly on me.
\v 15 Then¦334372 I went¦334372 to the captives at Tel¦334376-Abib who lived¦334378 along the Kebar¦334383 Canal, and I stayed among them there for seven¦334391 days¦334392, overwhelmed in amazement.
\rem /s1 A Watchman for Israel; The Lord Appoints Ezekiel as a Lookout; Warning to Israel
\rem /r (Ezekiel 33.1-9)
\p
\v 16 \add ≈After those seven¦334398 days¦334399 were over\add*, Yahweh¦334404 \add gave\add* me this message¦334402:\f + \fr 3:16 \ft This formula occurs around fifty times in Ezekiel's account.\f*
\v 17 “Humanity's child, I've made you¦334412 a \add ≈guard over the Israeli people\add*, so listen¦334415 to \add ≈this message¦334417 of mine\add* and give¦334418 them my warning¦334418.
\v 18 When I tell the wicked, ‘You'll certainly die’ and you don't¦334426 warn them \add about that\add* or give them a warning about their evil deeds so they might live—the wicked will die for their sin, but I'll \add ≈hold you responsible for their death\add*.
\v 19 \add ≈But¦334443\add* if you do warn the wicked, and they don't¦334448 turn from their wickedness or from their wicked deeds, then they'll die¦334456 for their sin, but you will have saved your own life¦334460.
\p
\v 20 If a godly person turns¦334464 from their righteousness and acts unjustly, and I set a stumbling¦334470 block¦334470 in front¦334471 of that person, they will die. Because you did not warn them, they'll die in their sin, and I won't¦334475 consider the righteous deeds¦334481 that they performed, but I'll \add ≈hold you responsible for their death\add*.
\v 21 \add ≈But¦334489\add* if you warn the godly person to stop sinning so that they no longer sin, \add @that person\add* will surely live since they were warned¦334503; and you will have saved your own life¦334507.”

\p
\v 22 Then Yahweh's hand¦334514 was on me there, and he told me, “\add ≈Get ready\add* \add and\add* go¦334520 out into the plain¦334523, and I'll speak¦334525 with you there.”
\p
\v 23 I \add ≈got up\add* and went¦334529 out into the plain¦334532 where Yahweh's glory was staying, like the glory that I had seen¦334542 beside the Kebar¦334547 Canal, so I fell \add ≈to my knees and bowed low to the ground\add*.
\v 24 Then¦334553 the spirit¦334556 entered¦334553 me and stood me up on my feet¦334560, and spoke¦334561 with me, telling me: Go and shut yourself¦334566 up in your¦334568 house¦334568.
\v 25 Humanity's¦334571 child, \add @people\add* will \add ≈tie you up with ropes¦334577\add* so that you'll be unable to go¦334581 \add ≈outside\add*.
\v 26 Then¦334584 I'll¦334585 make your tongue¦334584 stick¦334585 to the roof¦334588 of your mouth¦334588, so you'll become¦334592 mute, and although they're rebellious¦334598 \add ≈people\add*, you won't¦334590 be able to \add ≈tell them off\add*.
\v 27 \add ≈But¦334601\add* when I speak¦334601 to you, I'll open your mouth¦334606 so you'll be able to tell them, ‘This is what the master¦334611 Yahweh¦334611 says.’ The ones who will hear will hear \add but\add* the ones who won't listen will not listen, because they're a rebellious¦334621 \add ≈people\add*.

\v 1 But you, humanity's¦334628 child, get yourself¦334631 a brick¦334632 and place it \add ≈in front of\add* you and carve Yerushalem¦334641 City on it.
\v 2 Then¦334643 lay siege¦334645 against it, and build¦334646 forts against it. \add ≈Build\add* an assault ramp up against it and make camps around it. Place battering¦334658 rams all around it.
\v 3 \add ≈After that,\add* get yourself an iron pan and use it as an iron wall between yourself and \add your representation of\add* the city¦334673 and \add keep looking in that direction\add*, because it will be under siege and you're to put the siege against it. That will be a sign¦334683 to the \add ≈Israeli people\add*.
\p
\v 4 Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the house of Yisrael on it; you will carry their¦334711 sin for the number¦334703 of the days¦334704 that you lie down against the house of Yisrael.
\v 5 I myself am assigning¦334714 to you one day to represent each year of their¦334719 punishment: 390 days¦334721 \add lying on your left side\add*. In that way, you'll carry the \add ≈Israeli people's\add* sin.
\v 6 When \add ≈that period is over\add*, then lie down a second¦334744 time on your right¦334741 side, because you'll carry the sin of \add ≈Yehudah's¦334751 people\add* for forty¦334752 days. I am assigning¦334758 one day to you for each year.
\p
\v 7 \add ≈Keep looking\add* towards Yerushalem¦334764 that's under siege¦334763, and with your arm bared¦334768 \add like a warrior\add*, prophesy¦334769 against¦334770 it¦334770.

\v 10 You'll measure 250g by weight¦334827 to eat each day, and you'll eat it during the day at set times.
\v 11 Then¦334837 you'll measure¦334838 out half a litre of water¦334837 to drink each day, and you'll drink it at set times.
\v 12 You'll \add cook and¦334851\add* eat¦334850 \add @that bread\add* as barley¦334849 cakes, but \add burn sun-dried\add* human¦334854 excrement¦334853 to bake it¦334855 over \add ≈while they're watching\add*.

\v 1 Then¦334953 you, humanity's¦334955 child, take a sharp¦334961 sword¦334960 as a barber’s razor¦334962 for yourself¦334965, and \add ≈use it to shave¦334966\add* your head and beard¦334972, then get \add some\add* scales \add ≈so you can\add* weigh¦334976 your hair and divide¦334977 \add *it\add* \add equally into three piles\add*.
\v 2 Burn a third of it in the middle¦334982 of the city when the days of the siege¦334986 are completed¦334984, and take \add ≈the second pile\add* of hair and hit it with the sword all around¦334993 the city. Then scatter \add the final\add* third to the wind, and I'll draw out a sword to chase after¦334999 the people.
\v 3 \add ≈But¦335001\add* take¦335001 a few hairs from them and¦335005 tie them into the folds of your¦335007 robe¦335007.
\v 4 Then¦335009 take \add a bit\add* more of the hair and throw¦335012 it into the middle¦335016 of the fire \add ≈to be burnt up\add*—from there a fire will spread out to all the \add ≈Israeli¦335030 people\add*.”
\p
\v 5 My master¦335035 Yahweh¦335035 says¦335034, “That \add brick model\add* is Yerushalem¦335038 where I've placed her in the middle¦335039 of the nations¦335040, and where I have surrounded her with other \add ≈countries¦335040\add*.
\v 6 \add ≈But¦335045 due to her wickedness¦335049,\add* she's rejected my decrees more than \add other\add* nations¦335052 have, and \add ≡avoided\add* my regulations more than the countries¦335058 that surround her. Her¦335060 people have rejected my judgements and haven't \add ≈followed\add* my regulations.”
\v 7 Therefore my master` Yahweh¦335076 says this, “Because you are more troublesome than the nations that surround you, and haven't \add ≈followed\add* my statutes or acted according to my regulations¦335085, or even acted according to the decrees of the nations that surround you,”
\v 8 therefore my master¦335104 Yahweh¦335104 says¦335103 this, “Listen, I myself will work against¦335107 you. I'll execute¦335111 judgements¦335113 in the middle of you for the \add other\add* nations¦335115 to see¦335106.
\v 9 Because of your¦335135 detestable actions, I'll do things to you¦335118 that I've never done before, and¦335124 which I'll never do again¦335131:
\v 10 Fathers will eat the children among you, and sons will eat their¦335145 fathers¦335145, since I'll execute¦335146 judgement¦335148 on you and scatter¦335149 all of you who are left in every direction.\x + \xo 5:10: \xt Lam 4:10.\x*
\p
\v 11 This is my master¦335165 Yahweh’s declaration: As I live, it's certainly because¦335170 you've defiled my sanctuary¦335173 with all your hateful things and with all \add ≈the disgusting things you've done\add*, that I myself will reduce you in number—\add ≈I\add* won't have pity on you, and I won't spare you.
\v 12 A third of you will die by plague¦335196, plus they'll be consumed by a famine¦335198 \add ≈that affects you\add*. A third will fall by the sword surrounding you. Then I'll scatter a third in every direction, and draw out a sword to chase after¦335212 them as well.
\p
\v 13 Then¦335214 my \add ≈rage will be over\add*, and I'll \add ≈relax\add* my fury at them. I'll be satisfied, and they'll know¦335220 that I, Yahweh¦335224, have spoken¦335225 in my rage \add ≈and\add* I've completed my furious \add punishment\add* of them.
\v 14 I'll make you into \add ≈a city of ruins so that those from other nations¦335234 will mock you as they\add* pass by.
\v 15 So¦335242 Yerushalem will become something for other people to condemn and to mock—a warning¦335245 and a horror¦335246 to the nations¦335247 that surround you. I'll execute¦335250 judgments against you in rage¦335256 and fury, and with an angry rebuke¦335255. I, Yahweh¦335258 have declared that.
\v 16 I'll send¦335261 out harsh arrows¦335264 of famine against you that will become the means with which I will destroy you, because I'll \add ≈make the famine more severe and destroy your food supply\add*.
\v 17 I'll send¦335285 a famine¦335287 and disasters against you so you'll be childless¦335290. Plague and bloodshed¦335292 will pass¦335293 through you, and I will bring¦335297 a sword¦335296 against you. I, Yahweh¦335300, have declared that.\x + \xo 5:17: \xt Rev 6:8.\x*

\v 3 Say, ‘Mountains of Yisra'el, listen¦335326 to this message¦335327 from the master Yahweh.

\v 4 Then¦335349 your altars will become¦335349 desolate¦335349 and your pillars will be destroyed, and I'll throw¦335353 your dead down in front¦335355 of their idols¦335356.

Begin at my \add ≈sacred place\add*.” So they began¦336495 with the elders¦336497 who were in front¦336499 of the \add ≈temple\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add @Yahweh\add* told them, “Defile the \add ≈temple\add*, and fill¦336508 its courtyards¦336511 with the dead. \add ≈Now go¦336513\add*.” So¦336502 they went¦336514 out and \add started\add* attacking the city¦336516.
\p
\v 8 As they were attacking it, I found myself alone and I fell \add ≈to my knees with my head bowed down to the ground\add* and cried¦336526 out and said¦336527, “Ah, master¦336529 Yahweh¦336529, will you destroy¦336531 the entire¦336534 remnant¦336536 of Yisrael in the outpouring of your rage on Yerushalem¦336544?”
\p
\v 9 “The disobedience of the \add ≈people\add* of Yisrael and Yehudah has been \add ≈extremely bad\add*,” he answered. “The land is full of blood¦336558 and the city¦336559 full of perversions¦336561, since they say, ‘Yahweh has forgotten \add ≈this country\add*,’ and ‘Yahweh won't¦336569 \add ≈take any notice\add*.’
\v 10 So¦336573 then, \add ≈I won't show\add* compassion¦336578, and I won't spare them, rather I'll bring it¦336578 all on their heads¦336583.”
\p
\v 11 Then¦336586 wow, the man¦336587 dressed in linen¦336590 who had the writing¦336592 equipment by his side came back to report, saying, “I've¦336597 done everything you commanded¦336601.”

\p
\v 1 As I looked toward the dome that was over the heads of the winged creatures, something appeared¦336616 above them \add ≈that looked like a sapphire¦336615 stone¦336614 that had been made into\add* a throne¦336618.\x + \xo 10:1: \xt Eze 1:26; Rev 4:2.\x*
\v 2 Then Yahweh spoke to the man dressed in linen¦336628 and said, “Go between the wheels¦336634 underneath¦336637 the winged creatures, and fill both your hands¦336640 with fiery coals¦336641 from between the winged creatures and scatter¦336646 them over the city¦336649.”\x + \xo 10:2: \xt Rev 8:5.\x*
\p Then the man went in as I watched¦336651.
\v 3 The winged creatures stood on the right side of the \add ≈temple\add* when the man¦336658 went¦336657 in, and¦336659 a cloud¦336659 filled¦336660 the inner¦336664 courtyard¦336663.
\v 4 Yahweh's \add ≈brilliant light\add* rose up from the winged creature and stood over the threshold¦336673 of the house. It filled¦336675 the house with the cloud¦336679, and the courtyard¦336680 was full of the brightness¦336684 of Yahweh’s splendour.
\v 5 The sound¦336688 of the creatures' wings¦336689 could be heard¦336691 as far as the outer¦336695 courtyard¦336694, like the voice¦336696 of the powerful God¦336697 when he speaks¦336700.
\p
\v 6 When \add @Yahweh\add* had commanded¦336703 the man dressed in linen¦336709, “Take fire¦336712 from between the wheels that are between the winged creatures,” the man went in and stood¦336718 beside¦336719 a wheel.
\v 7 A winged creature reached out his hand¦336726 between¦336733 the winged creatures to the fire¦336731 that was among¦336727 \add *them\add*, and lifted it up and placed it into the hands¦336739 of the one dressed in linen¦336741. The man¦336740 took it and went¦336743 back out.
\p
\v 8 I \add ≈noticed\add* that the winged creatures had something like a human¦336750 hand¦336748 under¦336751 their¦336752 wings¦336752,
\v 9 then I looked¦336754, and wow, four¦336756 wheels were beside the winged creatures—one wheel beside each \add *one\add*—and the wheels seemed like shining chrysolite¦336774.\x + \xo 10:9-13: \xt Eze 1:15-21.\x*
\v 10 \add *They\add* all appeared¦336776 to be the same, like having a wheel within a wheel.
\v 11 When they moved, they went in any of their¦336790 four directions, without turning as they went, because whatever direction the head faced, they went in that direction without turning as they went.
\v 12 Their¦336817 whole body¦336809 (including their backs¦336810, their hands¦336811, and their wings¦336812) was covered with eyes, and eyes covered all around¦336816 the four wheels as well.\x + \xo 10:12: \xt Rev 4:8.\x*
\v 13 I heard \add someone\add* call them ‘the whirling wheels¦336820’.
\p
\v 14 Each one had four faces¦336827: the first face was the face of a winged creature, the second¦336834 was a man's face, the third¦336837 was a lion's face, and the fourth¦336840 was an eagle's¦336843 face.\x + \xo 10:14: \xt Eze 1:10; Rev 4:7.\x*
\v 15 Then¦336845 the living¦336848 creatures (they were the same ones that I¦336850 had seen¦336850 by the Kebar¦336853 channel) rose up \add in the air\add*.
\v 16 Whenever the winged creatures moved, the wheels would go beside them, and whenever the winged creatures lifted¦336860 up their¦336864 wings¦336864 to go up from the earth¦336867, the wheels didn't¦336868 turn—they still stayed beside them.
\v 17 When the winged creatures stood still, the wheels stood still, and when they went up, the wheels went up with them, because the spirit¦336883 of the living¦336884 creature was in the wheels.
\p
\v 18 Then¦336887 Yahweh's¦336889 \add ≈brilliant light\add* went¦336887 out over the \add ≈temple\add* threshold¦336891 and¦336893 stayed over the winged creatures.
\v 19 The winged creatures lifted¦336898 up their¦336902 wings¦336902 and rose from the ground in my sight when they¦336908 went¦336908 out, and the wheels¦336909 did the same beside them. They stood at the eastern entrance¦336912 to Yahweh's residence, and the \add ≈brilliant light\add* of Yisrael's God¦336919 came onto them from above¦336923.
\v 20 Those were the living¦336926 creatures that I had seen¦336928 below the Yisrael's God¦336930 by the Kebar¦336935 Canal, so I knew¦336936 that they¦336939 were winged creatures.
\p
\v 21 They each had four faces¦336943 and four wings, and had something like human¦336950 hands¦336949 under¦336951 their¦336952 wings,
\v 22 and their faces \add ≈resembled\add* the faces that I'd seen in the vision at the Kebar¦336964 Canal, and each of them went straight ahead.

\p
\v 1 Then¦336974 the spirit¦336976 lifted¦336974 me up and brought¦336977 me to the eastern gate of Yahweh's \add ≈temple\add*, facing east, and behold, in the doorway of the gate there were twenty-five men.

\p
\v 2 \add @Yahweh\add* told me, “Humanity's¦337014 child, these¦337017 are the men¦337018 who \add ≈plan to do evil¦337024 things\add* and who make wicked¦337020 plans in this city¦337025.

\v 4 So¦337042, prophesy against¦337040 them, humanity's¦337044 child, \add start\add* prophesying.”
\p
\v 5 Then¦337046 Yahweh's spirit¦337048 came on me and told me to say¦337052: This is what Yahweh says¦337055, “That is what you're all saying, \add ≈people\add* of Yisrael¦337060, because I know¦337064 what goes through your¦337062 mind.
\v 6 You've killed \add ≈many people\add* in this city¦337068, and¦337070 filled¦337070 its¦337071 streets¦337071 with them.
\p
\v 7 Therefore the master¦337079 Yahweh¦337079 says¦337078: The people you've killed, whose bodies you have laid in the middle of Yerushalem, are the meat, and this city is the pot. But you're all going to be brought out from the centre of this city.
\v 8 You've feared¦337094 the sword, so I am bringing¦337096 the sword upon you. That's my master¦337099 Yahweh's declaration.
\v 9 I'll bring you out from the city, and put you into the hands¦337107 of foreigners, because I'll bring judgment against you all.
\v 10 You'll all fall by the sword¦337114. I will judge¦337120 you within Yisrael's border so that you'll all know¦337122 that I am Yahweh¦337126.
\v 11 This city won't¦337129 be your cooking pot, nor will you be the meat within her. I'll judge¦337142 you all within Yisrael's borders¦337140.
\v 12 Then¦337145 you'll all know¦337145 that I'm Yahweh¦337149, the one whose instructions you haven't \add ≈obeyed\add* and whose regulations¦337151 you haven't \add ≈followed\add*.

\p
\v 13 Then¦337163 as I was prophesying¦337164, Benayah's¦337168 son Felatyah died¦337169. \add ≈So¦337163\add* I fell \add ≈to my knees with my face¦337173 bowed low to the ground\add* and cried¦337174 out with a loud voice¦337175, “Oh no, my master¦337180 Yahweh¦337180, will you¦337183 completely¦337182 \add ≈eliminate the Israeli people\add*?”

\v 45 You are the daughter¦339644 of your mother, who detested her husband and her children, and you are the sister of your sisters who detested their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite¦339659, and your father¦339660 was an Amorite¦339661.
\p
\v 46 Your¦339671 older¦339664 sister was Shomron¦339665 \add (Samaria¦339665)\add* and her daughters were the ones living in the north¦339671, while your¦339671 younger¦339673 sister was the one living south¦339676 of you, that is, Sodom¦339677 and her daughters.
\v 47 \add ≈Not only did you follow\add* their ways and copy their behaviour and practices, but in \add ≈everything that you did\add*, you've been \em worse\em* than they were.
\p
\v 48 This is the master¦339698 Yahweh’s declaration: As I live, your sister¦339704 Sodom¦339703 and her daughters, didn't do as much evil as you and your daughters have done.
\v 49 Listen, your¦339718 sister¦339718 Sodom's¦339717 sin was that she¦339733 was arrogant in her¦339727 leisure, careless and unconcerned about anything. She didn't¦339732 \add ≈assist\add* the poor and needy¦339731 people.
\v 50 She was arrogant and committed disgusting actions \add ≈in front of\add* me, so I took them away just as you have seen.
\p
\v 51 As for Shomron¦339745 \add (Samaria¦339745)\add*, they didn't¦339748 commit even half of your sins¦339747, instead, you've done many more disgusting things than they did, and you've shown that your sisters¦339758 were better than you because of all the disgusting things that you do.
\v 52 Also how you display your own shame—you've shown that your sisters were better than you by the sins¦339776 you committed in all those disgusting ways. Your sisters now seem better than you.
\rem /s1 Sodom and Samaria Will Be Restored
\p
\v 53 From their¦339795 captivity, I will restore¦339792 the fortunes of Sodom¦339800 and her daughters, and of Shomron¦339806 \add (Samaria¦339806)\add* and her daughters, and your fortunes \add ≈will be similar\add*\f + \fr 16:53 \ft i.e., to go into captivity, but then after a time, to be restored.\f*
\v 54 so that you will display your shame. You'll be humiliated because of everything that you've done, and in that way you'll be a consolation¦339821 to \add @Sodom and Shomron\add*.
\v 55 Your sister¦339824 Sodom¦339825 and her daughters will be restored to their former condition, and Shomron¦339829 and her daughters will be restored \add ≈similarly\add*. Then¦339824 you and your daughters will be restored to your former condition.
\v 56 \add ≈You never even mentioned your sister¦339841 Sodom¦339840 in the period when you were proud\add*
\v 57 before¦339847 your wickedness¦339849 was revealed. But now you're an object of scorn to the daughters of Aram¦339855 \add (Syria¦339855)\add* and to all the daughters of the Philistines¦339860 around her¦339858. People all around despise¦339861 you.
\v 58 You'll display your shame and your disgusting actions. That is Yahweh's declaration.
\s1 The agreement without ending
\rem /s1 An Everlasting Covenant; A Covenant That Lasts Forever
\p
\v 59 The master¦339880 Yahweh¦339880 says¦339879 this: ‘I'll deal with you as you deserve—you who've despised¦339889 your oath by breaking¦339891 \add &our\add* agreement.
\v 60 But¦339894 I myself will call to mind my agreement with you that was made \add ≈when you were younger\add*, and I'll establish¦339902 a never-ending agreement with you.
\v 61 Then¦339907 you'll call to mind your ways and be ashamed¦339911 when you receive¦339912 your older¦339916 sisters and your younger¦339920 sisters. I'll give them to you as daughters¦339925, but not because of your agreement.
\v 62 I myself will establish¦339929 my agreement with you, and¦339935 you'll know¦339935 that I am Yahweh¦339939
\v 63 so that you'll call everything to mind and be ashamed¦339943. Then you'll no longer open your mouth¦339950 to speak because of your shame, when I have forgiven¦339953 you for everything that you've done. That is the master¦339961 Yahweh's declaration.’ ”

\v 1 Then Yahweh¦339968 \add ≈gave\add* me \add another\add* message¦339966:
\v 2 “Humanity's child, present a riddle and¦339977 speak¦339977 a parable¦339978 to the \add ≈Israeli people\add*.
\v 3 Tell \add >them\add*, ‘The master¦339989 Yahweh¦339989 says¦339987 this: ‘A large eagle¦339991 with large wings¦339994 full of multi-coloured feathers¦339996, and long¦339995 pinions, went¦340003 to Lebanon¦340006 and grabbed hold of the top of a cedar¦340011 tree.
\v 4 He broke the top shoot¦340015 of \add @the tree\add* off, and took it to Canaan \add where he\add* placed it in a city¦340022 \add full\add* of merchants¦340021.
\v 5 He \add ≈also\add* took¦340026 some of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil, \add ≈beside a large body of water¦340036 where\add* a willow¦340038 \add might grow\add*.
\v 6 Then¦340041 \add @the seed\add* sprouted¦340041 and became a spreading vine low to the ground. Its branches turned¦340047 toward him, and its roots¦340050 grew \add ≈down below\add*, so it became a vine and produced¦340055 branches and sent out shoots¦340056.
\p
\v 7 \add ≈But¦340060\add* there was another large eagle with large wings¦340066 and many feathers. Oh wow, that vine¦340071 turned its roots¦340074 toward this eagle, and it spread out its branches¦340076 toward the eagle from the place it had been planted¦340083 so it might get watered¦340080.
\v 8 It had been planted¦340094 in good¦340088 soil beside a large body of water¦340091 so it would grow branches¦340096 and produce fruit¦340098, to become a magnificent vine¦340100.’
\p
\v 9 \add ≈Ask\add* \add the people\add*: ‘The master¦340107 Yahweh¦340107 wants to know if it will prosper¦340109? Won't it be uprooted and stripped¦340119 of its fruit¦340117 so that it withers¦340120, and all its fresh¦340123 growth will dry out? \add ≈You wouldn't have to be very strong or get lots of people to help\add* to pull it out by its roots.
\v 10 So¦340137 listen. After it had been planted¦340138, would it thrive¦340139? Wouldn't it wither up when the eastern wind¦340143 touches it? \add Yes,\add* it would wither right up in the garden plot where¦340150 it sprouted.’ ”

\v 11 Then Yahweh¦340157 \add ≈gave\add* me \add another\add* message¦340155:
\v 12 “\add ≈Ask\add* those rebellious¦340165 \add ≈people\add*, ‘Don't you know what those things mean? Listen, the king of Babylon came to Yerushalem¦340178 and took her king and her princes and took them with him to Babylon.\x + \xo 17:12-15: \xt 2Ki 24:15-20; 2Ch 36:10.\x*
\v 13 Then he took \add a member\add* of the royal¦340193 family¦340192, made an agreement with him—\add ≈forcing him to make various commitments\add*. Then he took away the \add ≈country's\add* \add former\add* powerful people,
\v 14 so the kingdom¦340207 would remain \add ≈subjected and not be able to become powerful again\add*. \add However,\add* by keeping the agreement, the \add ≈country\add* would \add at least\add* survive.
\v 15 But¦340217 the king of Yerushalem rebelled¦340217 against him by sending¦340220 his ambassadors¦340221 to Egypt¦340222 \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add* to acquire horses¦340226 and an army. Will he succeed¦340230? Will the one doing these¦340233 things escape? If he breaks¦340234 the agreement, will he \add ≈survive\add*?
\v 16 This is the master¦340242 Yahweh's declaration: As I live he'll definitely die in the land of the king who made him king, the king whose promises he despised¦340252, and whose agreement he broke¦340257. He'll die in the middle of Babylon¦340264.
\v 17 \add Egypt's\add* Far-oh \add (Pharaoh¦340274)\add* with his mighty army and a large¦340269 company¦340270 won't¦340267 help him¦340273 in battle, when ramps are constructed and siege¦340279 walls are built¦340278 up to cut off many lives¦340281
\v 18 because the king despised¦340284 his promise by breaking¦340286 the agreement. Wow, he reached out to make a promise and yet \add afterwards\add* he did all those things. He won't¦340295 escape¦340296.
\v 19 Therefore the master¦340303 Yahweh¦340303 says¦340302 this: ‘As I live, wasn't it my promise that he despised¦340313 and my agreement that he broke¦340316? \add ≈Therefore\add* I'll \add ≈cause him to be punished for what he did\add*.
\v 20 I'll spread¦340320 my net¦340322 out over him, and he'll be caught¦340323 in my trap, and I'll take him to Babylon¦340326 and handle his judgement¦340327 there¦340329 for the treason he committed when he betrayed me.
\v 21 All of his refugees in his armies will fall by the sword¦340344, and the ones who remain will be scattered¦340350 in every direction. Then¦340336 you'll all know¦340351 that I am Yahweh¦340354 because I've declared that that will happen.”

\v 23 I'll plant¦340383 it on Yisrael's highest mountain¦340380 so it will bear branches and produce¦340384 fruit¦340387, and it will become a majestic¦340390 cedar¦340389 so that every winged bird will live under¦340392 it. They'll nest in the shade¦340398 of its branches,
\v 24 then all the trees in the countryside¦340406 will know that I am Yahweh. I bring¦340410 down the high trees and I raise¦340414 up the low trees. I wither the watered tree and I cause the dried tree to bloom. I am Yahweh, I have declared that that will happen; and I will do it.’ ”

\v 4 Will you judge them? Will you judge, humanity's¦341246 child? Let them know about their¦341250 ancestors' \add ≈disgusting behaviour\add*.
\v 5 Tell them that the master¦341258 Yahweh says this: ‘On the day¦341260 that I chose¦341261 Yisrael¦341262 and made myself known¦341268 to them in Egypt¦341271, I raised my¦341273 hand to \add ≈make a promise\add* to Yakov's descendants¦341265.

\v 6 on that day¦341280 I raised my hand¦341283 to \add ≈make a promise\add* to them that I would bring¦341285 them out of Egypt¦341287 into a land that I had carefully selected¦341293 for them. It was flowing¦341295 with milk and honey¦341297—it¦341299 was the most beautiful¦341298 of all the lands¦341302.
\v 7 I told them, “Let each \add ≈family\add* throw¦341309 away the idols¦341310 from Egypt¦341311 plus \add ≈any other detestable¦341307 things¦341307 they have\add*. Don't \add ≈defile\add* yourselves¦341314. I am Yahweh¦341316 your¦341317 God¦341317.”
\v 8 \add ≈But¦341319\add* they rebelled¦341319 against me and were unwilling to listen¦341324 to me. \add *They\add* didn't¦341322 throw away the detestable¦341329 things¦341329 \add ≈they have\add* or abandon¦341338 their¦341330 Egyptian idols¦341335, so I determined to pour out my fury upon them to satisfy my rage among them \add ≈right there\add* in Egypt¦341336.
\v 9 I \add ≈did that to protect my reputation\add* so it wouldn't be \add ≈tarnished\add* in the eyes¦341355 of the nations¦341356 \add ≈where they¦341359 were staying\add*.

\p
\v 10 \add ≈So¦341369\add* I led them out of Egypt¦341371 and took them into the wilderness¦341375.

\v 13 \add ≈But¦341410 the Israeli people\add* rebelled¦341410 against me in the wilderness.

\v 17 \add ≈But¦341499\add* I pitied them so I didn't¦341502 \add ≈wipe them out\add* in the wilderness¦341508.

\p
\v 25 Then¦341642 I even gave¦341645 them instructions that weren't good¦341649, and¦341650 regulations¦341647 that they¦341652 couldn't live¦341652 by.

\v 11 Her¦343382 sister Oholibah¦343383 saw that, but she lusted more passionately and prostituted¦343390 herself even more wildly than her¦343382 sister.

\v 14 Then¦343417 she increased¦343417 her¦343420 prostitution even more. She saw¦343421 men¦343422 carved¦343423 on walls, figures of Chaldeans painted in red,
\v 15 wearing belts around their waists¦343435, with flowing turbans¦343437 on their heads¦343438. All of them looked like chariot troop officers¦343440, similar to Babylonians (whose native¦343448 land is Chaldea¦343446).
\v 16 As soon as \add *she\add* saw \add @those drawings\add*, she lusted¦343450 for \add @those men\add*, so she sent¦343455 messengers¦343456 out to them in Chaldea¦343458.

\v 23 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod¦343558, Shoa¦343559, and Koa¦343560, and all the Assyrians with them—strong, handsome men, governors¦343568 and commanders¦343569, all of them are officers¦343571 and men of reputation, all of them riding on horses¦343574.
\v 24 They'll bring many people¦343583 against you with weapons¦343579, as well as chariots¦343580 and wagons¦343581.

\v 26 They'll strip¦343616 off your clothes¦343619 and take¦343620 away all your \add ≈jewellery\add*.
\v 27 I will remove your shameful behaviour from you, and your acts of prostitution from Egypt. You'll \add ≈give up your longing looks towards them\add*, and you won't¦343632 think about Egypt any more,’
\v 28 because the master¦343647 Yahweh¦343647 says this, Listen, I'll \add ≈hand you over to\add* the ones you hate—back into the \add ≈control\add* of the ones that you had turned away from.
\v 29 They'll \add ≈show their hate for you as\add* they take¦343664 all your possessions and abandon you naked and bare—\add ≈yes,\add* your nakedness will be uncovered just like when you engaged in promiscuity and prostitution.
\v 30 These things will be done to you because of your acting like a prostitute—lusting after¦343681 nations¦343682 by which you became defiled with their¦343687 idols¦343687.
\p
\v 31 You \add ≈followed a similar path¦343689 to that\add* of your \add older\add* sister¦343690, so I'll \add ≈give¦343692 you¦343691 the same punishment that I gave her¦343693\add*.’
\v 32 The master¦343699 Yahweh¦343699 says¦343698 this, ‘You'll \add ≈suffer the same extreme suffering that your sister¦343702 suffered\add*. You'll become¦343706 a laughingstock¦343707 and a subject for derision¦343708—\add ≈there's a lot of pain coming your way\add*.

\v 12 like a shepherd¦348725 searches for his sheep¦348732 when he's among his scattered flock. Thus I'll look for my flock and I'll rescue¦348739 them from all the places¦348743 where¦348744 they were scattered on the day of clouds¦348748 and darkness¦348749.
\v 13 \add ≈So¦348751\add* I'll bring \add @my people¦348754\add* out from among the \add ≈nations\add*. I'll gather¦348755 them from \add foreign\add* lands and bring them \add back\add* to their¦348762 land. I'll put them in pastures on Yisrael's mountainsides¦348766, by the streams, and in every settlement in the land.
\v 14 I'll put them in good pastures—Yisrael's high mountains¦348778 will be their¦348783 grazing places. They'll lie down there¦348784 in places good for grazing, in abundant pastures, and they'll graze¦348790 on Yisrael's hills.
\v 15 I myself will shepherd¦348797 my flock¦348798, and¦348799 I myself will make them lie down. That is the master¦348802 Yahweh's declaration.
\p
\v 16 I'll search out the lost and restore the outcast. I'll bandage up those who're broken and heal those who're sick, but I'll destroy¦348825 those who are fat and well. I will shepherd with justice¦348827.
\p
\v 17 So¦348829 now this is what the master¦348833 Yahweh¦348833 says, You my flock¦348830, listen, I'll be a judge¦348836 between one sheep and another, and between rams and billy goats¦348842.
\v 18 Isn't it enough¦348844 to feed on the good pasture, that you must trample¦348851 down \add ≈any remaining grass\add* with your feet? Or to drink¦348856 from clear¦348853 waters¦348855, then muddying¦348860 the streams with your feet?
\v 19 Must my flock¦348862 eat what you've trampled¦348863 with your feet, and drink¦348868 what you have muddied with your feet?
\p
\v 20 Therefore the master¦348874 Yahweh¦348874 says this to them: Listen, I myself will judge¦348880 between the fat sheep and the thin ones,
\v 21 because you \add shepherds\add* have pushed them with your sides and shoulders¦348891, and you've gored all the weak ones with your horns¦348893 until¦348898 you all \add succeeded in\add* scattering¦348900 them away from the land.
\v 22 I'll save my flock¦348907 and they'll no longer be \add taken as\add* plunder, and I will judge¦348913 between¦348914 one sheep and \add ≈the next\add*.
\v 23 I'll set one shepherd over them—my servant¦348925 David¦348926. He'll \add ≈look after\add* them, and he'll be their shepherd.\x + \xo 34:23: \xt Rev 7:17.\x*
\v 24 Then¦348936 I, Yahweh, will be their¦348944 God¦348940, and¦348941 my servant¦348941 David¦348942 will be a leader among them. I, Yahweh, have declared that.\x + \xo 34:24: \xt Eze 37:24.\x*

\v 25 Then¦348949 I'll make a peace¦348952 treaty with them and remove the wild animals¦348954 from the land, so that they'll \add be able to\add* live¦348960 securely in the wilderness¦348961 and sleep¦348963 safely in the forests.
\p
\v 26 I will also \add ≈bless\add* \add both\add* them and on the places around¦348968 my hill, and send¦348971 out showers in due season¦348973—they'll be showers of blessing.
\v 27 Then¦348978 the trees in the countryside¦348980 will produce their fruit¦348983, the soil will yield its¦348986 produce, and my sheep will be secure¦348991 in their land. When I break¦348997 \add ≈off the ties holding the yoke\add* \add onto their necks\add*, and when I rescue¦349002 them from the \add ≈control\add* of those who enslaved¦349004 them, then they'll know¦348992 that I am Yahweh¦348996.
\v 28 They'll no longer be plunder for the \add other\add* nations¦349012, and the wild animals¦349013 on the land will no longer devour¦349016 them. Then¦349007 they'll live¦349017 securely, and no one will \add ≈make them afraid\add*.
\v 29 I'll provide¦349022 a land for them that's known for its crops so they won't be victims of famine¦349031, and they won't be \add ≈mocked by\add* \add other\add* nations¦349038.
\v 30 Then¦349040 they'll know that I, Yahweh their¦349044 God¦349044, am with them. The \add ≈Israeli people\add* are my people. That is the master¦349051 Yahweh's declaration.
