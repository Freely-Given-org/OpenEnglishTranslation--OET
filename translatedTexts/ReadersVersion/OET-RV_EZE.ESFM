\ms1 Yehezkel's calling to be a prophet
\mr (1:1–3:27)
\s1 Yahweh reveals himself
\rem /s1 The Living Creatures and the Glory of the Lord; The calling of Ezekiel; A Vision of Living Beings; The Vision of the Chariot; God's Throne
\p
\v 1 \add When I was\add* thirty years \add old\add*, on July 5th as I was \add ≈living with the other captives\add* by the Kevar Canal, the skies opened and I saw visions from God.\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Rev 19:11.\x*
\p
\v 2 That was the fifth year since King Yoyakin \add (Jehoiachin)\add* had been taken captive.\x + \xo 1:2: \xt 2Ki 24:10-16; 2Ch 36:9-10.\x*
\v 3 Yahweh's message came to \add me\add*, the priest Yehezkel (son of Buzi) in the land of the Chaldeans \add (often known better as Babylonians)\add* by the Kevar Canal, and Yahweh \add ≈revealed his strength to me\add* there.
\v 4 Then I looked, and there was a windstorm coming from the north—a huge cloud with \add ≈lightning\add* flashing inside it and \add ≈brilliant light\add* inside it and surrounding it, and fire inside the cloud \add ≈made it appear as\add* an amber colour.
\v 5 In the middle \add ≈was what seemed to be\add* four living creatures resembling humans,\x + \xo 1:5: \xt Rev 4:6.\x*
\v 6 \add ≈but\add* each of them had four faces and four wings.
\v 7 Their legs were straight, but they had hooves like calves that gleamed like polished bronze.
\v 8 They had human hands under their wings on each of their four sides. For each of the four of them,
\v 9 their wings were touching the wings of the next creature, and they didn't turn as they went—rather each one went straight forward.
\p
\v 10 Their faces \add at the front\add* were like a man's face, then they each had a lion's face on the right, a calf's face on the left, and the fourth was an eagle's face.\x + \xo 1:10: \xt Ezr 1:5,10; 10:4; Eze 10:14; Rev 4:7.\x*
\v 11 Their faces were like that, and their wings were spread out above, so that each creature had a pair of wings that touched another creature's wing, and also a pair that covered their bodies.
\v 12 Each went straight forward, so that wherever the spirit directed them to go, they went without turning.
\p
\v 13 The living creatures \add ≈resembled\add* burning coals \add ≈or\add* torches. Bright fire also moved around among the creatures, and there were flashes of lightning.\x + \xo 1:13: \xt Rev 4:5.\x*
\v 14 The living creatures moved rapidly swiftly back and forth, and they \add ≈looked a bit like\add* lightning.
\p
\v 15 Then I looked \add ≈more closely\add* and then I saw a wheel on the ground beside each of the living creatures with its four faces.\x + \xo 1:15-21: \xt Eze 10:9-13.\x*
\v 16 \add ≈Each of the wheels was the same, and they all shone like\add* chrysolite. \add ≈Each wheel seemed to have one wheel inside the other\add* wheel.
\v 17 \add When\add* they moved, \add ≈they didn't have to turn to change direction\add*.
\v 18 The rims \add @of the wheels\add* were \add ≈awesomely tall\add*, and all four of them were full of eyes around the rim.\x + \xo 1:18: \xt Rev 4:8.\x*
\v 19 Whenever the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them. When the living creatures \add ≈went upwards\add*, the wheels also went up.
\v 20 Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels went up beside them, because the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\v 21 Whenever the creatures moved, the wheels also moved, and when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still. When the creatures \add ≈went upwards\add*, the wheels went up beside them, because the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\p
\v 22 Above the living creatures was \add ≈something like an awesome crystal dome stretched out over their heads\add*.\x + \xo 1:22: \xt Rev 4:6.\x*
\v 23 Beneath the dome, each of the creatures' wings stretched out straight and touched another creature's wings. Each \add *one\add* also had a pair to cover his own body with.
\v 24 Then I heard the sound of their wings \add which was\add* like the noise of a lot of water. When they moved, it was ike the voice of the powerful \add one\add*—like the sound of a rainstorm \add or\add* an army. Whenever they stood still, they lowered their wings.\x + \xo 1:24: \xt Rev 1:4-15; 19:6.\x*
\v 25 A voice came from under the dome that was above their heads, whenever they stopped and lowered their wings.
\s1 God's throne
\p
\v 26 Above the dome over their heads was \add ≈what looked like a sapphire stone that had been made into\add* a throne, and on the thing like a throne was a \add ≈something that appeared to be\add* a man.\x + \xo 1:26: \xt Eze 10:1; Rev 4:2-3.\x*
\v 27 I saw a figure \add ≈that appeared to have\add* glowing metal with fire in it from his hips upwards, and \add ≈looking downwards from\add* his hips, I saw the appearance of fire and brightness all around.\x + \xo 1:27: \xt Eze 8:2.\x*
\v 28 The bright light surrounding \add @the throne\add* was like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day—tt was the appearance of the likeness of Yahweh's splendour. When I saw it, I \add ≈quickly knelt down and bowed my head to the ground\add*, and I heard a voice speaking.

\s1 The making to Yehezkel prophet
\rem /s1 Ezekiel's Call and Commission; Ezekiel's Call; The Vision of the Scroll
\p
\v 1 He said to me, “Humanity's child, stand up and then I'll speak to you.”
\v 2 Then as he spoke to me, the spirit entered into me and \add ≈stood me up\add*, and I heard him speaking to me.
\v 3 He told me, “Humanity's child, I'm sending you to Yisra'el's people—\add two\add* rebellious nations that have rebelled against me. Both they and their ancestors have been sinning against me \add ≈right until this moment\add*.
\v 4 Their descendants \add ≈are very stubborn and hard headed\add*. I'm sending you to them, and you'll tell them that this is what the master Yahweh is saying to them.
\v 5 They might listen or might not. They're a rebellious \add ≈bunch\add*, but they'll at least know that a prophet has been among them.
\p
\v 6 And you, humanity's child, don't be afraid of them or their words. Don't be afraid, even though you're with briers and thorns and although you live with scorpions. Don't fear their words or be dismayed by their faces, since they're a rebellious \add ≈bunch\add*.
\v 7 \add ≈Pass my\add* messages onto them, whether they listen or not, because they're \add quite\add* rebellious.
\v 8 \add ≈But\add* you, humanity's child, listen to what I am telling you. Don't become rebellious like that rebellious \add ≈bunch\add*. Open your mouth and eat what I'm \add about to\add* give to you.”
\v 9 Then I looked and saw a hand extended out to me and \add ≈it was holding a scroll with writing on it\add*.\x + \xo 2:9-10: \xt Rev 5:1.\x*
\v 10 He spread it out \add ≈in front of\add* me—it had been written on both the front and the back, \add ≈the contents were full of messages about grief, mourning, and sad endings\add*.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 He said to me, “Humanity's child, what you've found, eat. Eat this scroll, then go speak to the \add ≈Israeli people\add*.”\x + \xo 3:1-3: \xt Rev 10:9-10.\x*
\v 2 So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.
\p
\v 3 He told me, “Humanity's child, feed your belly and fill your stomach with this scroll that I've given you.” So I ate it, and it \add ≈tasted\add* as sweet as honey.
\p
\v 4 Then he told me, “Humanity's child, go to the house of Israel and \add ≈pass\add* my messages on to them
\v 5 because you aren't being sent to a people \add ≈who speak\add* a strange or difficult language, but to the \add ≈Israeli people\add*—
\v 6 not to many peoples \add ≈who speak\add* strange or difficult languages whose words you wouldn't be able to understand. \add ≈I'm sure that if it was them that\add* I sent you to, they would have listened to you.
\v 7 \add ≈But\add* the \add ≈Israeli people\add* won't be willing to listen to you, because they're not willing to listen to me. So all the \add ≈Israeli people\add* are \add ≈hard-headed\add* and hard-hearted.
\v 8 \add ≈Listen, I'll enable you to be as stubborn and tough as they are\add*.
\v 9 I'll make \add ≈you hard\add* like a diamond—harder than flint Don't \add ≈be scared by\add* them or discouraged by \add ≈the looks they give you\add*, because they're rebellious \add ≈people\add*.”
\p
\v 10 He \add ≈also\add* told me, “Humanity's child, \add ≈listen very carefully to what I say\add*, and \add ≈keep thinking about it\add*.
\v 11 Then go to \add ≈any of your people who were brought here as\add* captives, and tell them, ‘This is what the master Yahweh says,’ whether they'll listen or not.”
\rem /s1 Ezekiel at the River Chebar
\p
\v 12 Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard rumbling like a large earthquake behind me. (Blessed be Yahweh's \add ≈honour\add* in his place.)
\v 13 It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels that were with them, and the sound of a large earthquake.
\v 14 Then the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went with bitterness in my spirit's rage, because Yahweh's hand was pressing down firmly on me.
\v 15 Then I went to the captives at Tel-Abib who lived along the Kebar Canal, and I stayed among them there for seven days, overwhelmed in amazement.

\rem /r (Ezekiel 33.1-9)
\p
\v 16 \add ≈After those seven days were over\add*, Yahweh \add gave\add* me this message:\f + \fr 3:16 \ft This formula occurs around fifty times in Ezekiel's account.\f*
\v 17 “Humanity's child, I've made you a \add ≈guard over the Israeli people\add*, so listen to \add ≈this message of mine\add* and give them my warning.
\v 18 When I tell the wicked, ‘You'll certainly die’ and you don't warn them \add about that\add* or give them a warning about their evil deeds so they might live—the wicked will die for their sin, but I'll \add ≈hold you responsible for their death\add*.
\v 19 \add ≈But\add* if you do warn the wicked, and they don't turn from their wickedness or from their wicked deeds, then they'll die for their sin, but you will have saved your own life.
\p
\v 20 If a godly person turns from their righteousness and acts unjustly, and I set a stumbling block in front of that person, they will die. Because you did not warn them, they'll die in their sin, and I won't consider the righteous deeds that they performed, but I'll \add ≈hold you responsible for their death\add*.
\v 21 \add ≈But\add* if you warn the godly person to stop sinning so that they no longer sin, \add @that person\add* will surely live since they were warned; and you will have saved your own life.”

\p
\v 22 Then Yahweh's hand was on me there, and he told me, “\add ≈Get ready\add* \add and\add* go out into the plain, and I'll speak with you there.”
\p
\v 23 I \add ≈got up\add* and went out into the plain where Yahweh's glory was staying, like the glory that I had seen beside the Kebar Canal, so I fell \add ≈to my knees and bowed low to the ground\add*.
\v 24 Then the spirit entered me and stood me up on my feet, and spoke with me, telling me: Go and shut yourself up in your house.
\v 25 Humanity's child, \add @people\add* will \add ≈tie you up with ropes\add* so that you'll be unable to go \add ≈outside\add*.
\v 26 Then I'll make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, so you'll become mute, and although they're rebellious \add ≈people\add*, you won't be able to \add ≈tell them off\add*.
\v 27 \add ≈But\add* when I speak to you, I'll open your mouth so you'll be able to tell them, ‘This is what the master Yahweh says.’ The ones who will hear will hear \add but\add* the ones who won't listen will not listen, because they're a rebellious \add ≈people\add*.

\p
\v 1 But you, humanity's child, get yourself a brick and place it \add ≈in front of\add* you and carve Yerushalem City on it.
\v 2 Then lay siege against it, and build forts against it. \add ≈Build\add* an assault ramp up against it and make camps around it. Place battering rams all around it.
\v 3 \add ≈After that,\add* get yourself an iron pan and use it as an iron wall between yourself and \add your representation of\add* the city and \add keep looking in that direction\add*, because it will be under siege and you're to put the siege against it. That will be a sign to the \add ≈Israeli people\add*.
\p
\v 4 Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the house of Israel on it; you will carry their sin for the number of the days that you lie down against the house of Israel.
\v 5 I myself am assigning to you one day to represent each year of their punishment: 390 days \add lying on your left side\add*. In that way, you'll carry the \add ≈Israeli people's\add* sin.
\v 6 When \add ≈that period is over\add*, then lie down a second time on your right side, because you'll carry the sin of \add ≈Yehudah's people\add* for forty days. I am assigning one day to you for each year.
\p
\v 7 \add ≈Keep looking\add* towards Yerushalem that's under siege, and with your arm bared \add like a warrior\add*, prophesy against it.
\v 8 \add ≈Listen,\add* I'll \add have you\add* tied with ropes so you won't be able to turn from one side to the other until the days \add representing the years\add* of your siege are over.
\p
\v 9 Take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt for yourself, \add and\add* put them into a single container and make bread for yourself according to the number of the days that you'll lie upon your side—\add yes,\add* you'll eat it for 390 days.
\v 10 You'll measure 250g by weight to eat each day, and you'll eat it during the day at set times.
\v 11 Then you'll measure out half a litre of water to drink each day, and you'll drink it at set times.
\v 12 You'll \add cook and\add* eat \add @that bread\add* as barley cakes, but \add burn sun-dried\add* human excrement to bake it over \add ≈while they're watching\add*.
\p
\v 13 Yahweh says that that means that the bread that the Israeli people will eat there among the \add other\add* nations that I'll banish them to will be ceremonially unclean.
\v 14 \add ≈But I protested\add*, “Oh no, master Yahweh. I've never \add ≈broken our dietary laws\add*. I've never eaten either anything that died or anything killed by animals \add ≈since I was young\add* until now, and foul meat has never entered my mouth.”
\p
\v 15 So \add @Yahweh\add* \add ≈answered\add* me, “Listen, I'll give you cow manure instead of human excrement so you can \add ≈bake\add* your bread over that.”
\p
\v 16 Then he told me, “Humanity's child, listen. I'm breaking the \add ≈cycle of food supply\add* in Yerushalem, and they'll eat bread while rationing it in anxiety, and drink water while rationing it in trembling.
\v 17 \add ≈because\add* they'll lack \add both\add* food and water, and everyone will be appalled by \add the actions of\add* their \add ≈neighbours\add* and they'll waste away because they \add ≈disobeyed\add* \add God\add*.

\s1 Yehezkel's Yerushalem model
\rem /s1 A Sword against Jerusalem; A Sign of the Coming Judgment; Ezekiel Cuts His Hair
\p
\v 1 Then you, humanity's child, take a sharp sword as a barber’s razor for yourself, and \add ≈use it to shave\add* your head and beard, then get \add some\add* scales \add ≈so you can\add* weigh your hair and divide \add *it\add* \add equally into three piles\add*.
\v 2 Burn a third of it in the middle of the city when the days of the siege are completed, and take \add ≈the second pile\add* of hair and hit it with the sword all around the city. Then scatter \add the final\add* third to the wind, and I'll draw out a sword to chase after the people.
\v 3 \add ≈But\add* take a few hairs from them and tie them into the folds of your robe.
\v 4 Then take \add a bit\add* more of the hair and throw it into the middle of the fire \add ≈to be burnt up\add*—from there a fire will spread out to all the \add ≈Israeli people\add*.”
\p
\v 5 My master Yahweh says, “That \add brick model\add* is Yerushalem where I've placed her in the middle of the nations, and where I have surrounded her with other \add ≈countries\add*.
\v 6 \add ≈But due to her wickedness,\add* she's rejected my decrees more than \add other\add* nations have, and \add ≡avoided\add* my regulations more than the countries that surround her. Her people have rejected my judgements and haven't \add ≈followed\add* my regulations.”
\v 7 Therefore my master` Yahweh says this, “Because you are more troublesome than the nations that surround you, and haven't \add ≈followed\add* my statutes or acted according to my regulations, or even acted according to the decrees of the nations that surround you,”
\v 8 therefore my master Yahweh says this, “Listen, I myself will work against you. I'll execute judgements in the middle of you for the \add other\add* nations to see.
\v 9 Because of your detestable actions, I'll do things to you that I've never done before, and which I'll never do again:
\v 10 Fathers will eat the children among you, and sons will eat their fathers, since I'll execute judgement on you and scatter all of you who're left in every direction.\x + \xo 5:10: \xt Lam 4:10.\x*
\p
\v 11 This is my master Yahweh’s declaration: As I live, it's certainly because you've defiled my sanctuary with all your hateful things and with all \add ≈the disgusting things you've done\add*, that I myself will reduce you in number—\add ≈I\add* won't have pity on you, and I won't spare you.
\v 12 A third of you will die by plague, plus they'll be consumed by a famine \add ≈that affects you\add*. A third will fall by the sword surrounding you. Then I'll scatter a third in every direction, and draw out a sword to chase after them as well.
\p
\v 13 Then my \add ≈rage will be over\add*, and I'll \add ≈relax\add* my fury at them. I'll be satisfied, and they'll know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my rage \add ≈and\add* I've completed my furious \add punishment\add* of them.
\v 14 I'll make you into \add ≈a city of ruins so that those from other nations will mock you as they\add* pass by.
\v 15 So Yerushalem will become something for other people to condemn and to mock—a warning and a horror to the nations that surround you. I'll execute judgments against you in rage and fury, and with an angry rebuke. I, Yahweh have declared that.
\v 16 I'll send out harsh arrows of famine against you that will become the means with which I will destroy you, because I'll \add ≈make the famine more severe and destroy your food supply\add*.
\v 17 I'll send a famine and disasters against you so you'll be childless. Plague and bloodshed will pass through you, and I will bring a sword against you. I, Yahweh, have declared that.\x + \xo 5:17: \xt Rev 6:8.\x*

\v 2 “Humanity's child, \add ≈look towards\add* Yisra'el's mountains and prophesy to them.
\v 3 Say, ‘Mountains of Yisra'el, listen to this message from the master Yahweh. My master Yahweh says this to the mountains and to the hills, to the streambeds, and to the valleys: Listen, I'm bringing a sword against you all, and I'll destroy your \add ≈hilltop shrines\add*.
\v 4 Then your altars will become desolate and your pillars will be destroyed, and I'll throw your dead down in front of their idols.
\v 5 I'll lay the dead bodies of Yisra'el's people \add right there\add* \add ≈in front of\add* their idols, and scatter your bones around your altars.
\v 6 Everywhere you all live, cities will be \add ≈turned to rubble\add* and the \add ≈hilltop shrines\add* ruined, so that your altars will be \add ≈broken down and left idle\add*.

\v 8 \add ≈But\add* I'll preserve a remnant among you, and there'll be some who escape the sword among the nations, when you're scattered throughout the countries.

\v 12 \add ≈Those who are far from\add* \add Yerushalem\add* will die by plague, and those who are near will fall by the sword. Those who remain and survive will die by famine. \add ≈That's the way that\add* I'll put my fury against them \add ≈into action\add*.
\v 13 Then you'll know that I am Yahweh, when their dead lie among their idols, around their altars, on every high hill—on all the mountain peaks, and under every flourishing tree and thick oak—the places where they burned incense to all their idols.
\v 14 I'll strike the land with my hand and make \add ≈it bare and deserted\add* from the wilderness to Diblah, throughout all the places where they live. Then they'll know that I am Yahweh.”

\s1 Yerushalem's disgusting idol worship
\rem /s1 Abominations in the Temple; Idolatry in the Temple; Idolatry in Jerusalem
\p
\v 1 Then in \add ≈the middle of\add* the sixth year\f + \fr 8:1 \ft About fourteen months later—around mid-September 592 B.C.\f* as I sat in my house and Yehudah's elders sat \add ≈in front of\add* me, my master Yahweh's hands fell upon me there again.
\v 2 I looked, and wow—there was \add ≈something that looked a bit like\add* a man. From the appearance of his hips downward there was fire, and from his hips upward there was the appearance of something shining like glowing metal.\x + \xo 8:2: \xt Eze 1:27.\x*
\v 3 Then he reached out the form of a hand and took me by my hair—the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the heavens, and in visions from God, he took me to Yerushalem, to the entrance of the inner northern gate where the idol was that made \add Yahweh\add* very \add ≈jealous\add*.
\p
\v 4 Then wow, the \add ≈brilliant light\add* of Yisra'el's God was there, just like the vision that I'd seen on the plain.\x + \xo 8:4: \xt Eze 1:28.\x*
\v 5 Then he told me, “Humanity's child, \add ≈look towards\add* the north.” \add ≈So\add* I \add ≈looked towards\add* the north and to the north of the gate leading to the altar—there in the entrance, was the idol \add that caused the\add* jealousy.
\p
\v 6 \add ≈So\add* he told me, “Humanity's child, do you see what they're doing? Those are \add ≈horribly disgusting things\add* that the \add ≈Israeli people\add* are doing here to \add ≈drive\add* me far from my own sanctuary. \add ≈But\add* you'll see even more disgusting \add things\add* \add soon\add*.”
\p
\v 7 Then he took me to the courtyard doorway, and I looked and \add ≈was\add* a hole in the wall.
\v 8 He told me, “Humanity's child, dig into this wall.” So I dug into the wall, and \add ≈discovered\add* a doorway.
\v 9 Then he told me, “Go and see the \add ≈disgustingly wicked things\add* that they're doing there.”
\v 10 \add ≈So\add* I went through and looked, and oh dear, there was every form of creeping thing and detestable creature. \add Drawings of\add* every idol from the \add ≈Israeli people\add* were carved into the wall all around.
\v 11 Seventy elders from the \add ≈Israeli people\add* were there, and Shafan's son Yaazanyah was standing in the middle of them. They were standing in front of the images, and each man \add ≈was holding\add* his incense burner so that the smell of the cloud of incense went up.
\v 12 Then he \add ≈asked\add* me, “Humanity's child, do you see what the \add ≈Israeli\add* elders are doing in the dark? Each one does this in the hidden chamber of his idol, because they say, ‘Yahweh doesn't \add even\add* \add ≈notice\add* us. Yahweh has \add ≈abandoned this country\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 13 Then he told me, “Turn again and see the other \add ≈terribly digusting things\add* that they're doing,”
\v 14 and he took me to the gate at the northern entrance of Yahweh's, and oh dear—there were some women sitting there mourning for the \add Babylonian\add* Tammuz \add deity\add*.
\v 15 Then he said to me, “Humanity's child, do you see that? Turn again, and you'll see even \add ≈more disgusting things\add* than those.”
\p
\v 16 Then he took me into the inner courtyard of Yahweh's house, and oh no—at the entrance of Yahweh's temple between the portico and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple and their faces toward the east \add ≈where\add* they were worshiping the sun.
\p
\v 17 He \add ≈asked\add* me, “Humanity's child, do you see that? Is it a little thing for the \add ≈people\add* of Yehudah to do those \add ≈disgusting things\add* that they're doing here?

\v 2 Then wow, six men came out from the pathway of the upper gate that faces north, each \add ≈carrying\add* his weapon of slaughter. There was a man \add ≈among them\add* dressed in linen with a wrter's equipment at his side. Then they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
\p
\v 3 Then the \add ≈bright light representing\add* Yisrael's God went from the winged creature where it had been, up to the threshold of the house. \add @Yahweh\add* called to the man dressed in linen who had the \add ≈writing\add* equipment at his side.
\v 4 Yahweh told him, “Go through the middle of Yerushalem City, and make a mark on the foreheads of those who complain and despair about all the \add ≈disgusting things being done\add* \add there\add* in the middle of the city.”\x + \xo 9:4: \xt Rev 7:1-8; 9:4; 14:1.\x*
\p
\v 5 Then he spoke to the others within my hearing, “Go through the city after him and kill. Don't let \add ≈yourselves\add* have compassion, and don't show any pity.
\v 6 Slaughter all the old men, young men and women, little children and women, \add ≈but\add* don't approach anyone who has the mark on their head. Begin at my \add ≈sacred place\add*.” So they began with the elders who were in front of the \add ≈temple\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add @Yahweh\add* told them, “Defile the \add ≈temple\add*, and fill its courtyards with the dead. \add ≈Now go\add*.” So they went out and \add started\add* attacking the city.
\p
\v 8 As they were attacking it, I found myself alone and I fell \add ≈to my knees with my head bowed down to the ground\add* and cried out and said, “Ah, master Yahweh, will you destroy the entire remnant of Yisrael in the outpouring of your rage on Yerushalem?”
\p
\v 9 “The disobedience of the \add ≈people\add* of Yisrael and Yehudah has been \add ≈extremely bad\add*,” he answered. “The land is full of blood and the city full of perversions, since they say, ‘Yahweh has forgotten \add ≈this country\add*,’ and ‘Yahweh won't \add ≈take any notice\add*.’
\v 10 So then, \add ≈I won't show\add* compassion, and I won't spare them, rather I'll bring it all on their heads.”

\v 2 Then Yahweh spoke to the man dressed in linen and said, “Go between the wheels underneath the winged creatures, and fill both your hands with fiery coals from between the winged creatures and scatter them over the city.”\x + \xo 10:2: \xt Rev 8:5.\x*
\p Then the man went in as I watched.
\v 3 The winged creatures stood on the right side of the \add ≈temple\add* when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner courtyard.
\v 4 Yahweh's \add ≈brilliant light\add* rose up from the winged creature and stood over the threshold of the house. It filled the house with the cloud, and the courtyard was full of the brightness of Yahweh’s splendour.
\v 5 The sound of the creatures' wings could be heard as far as the outer courtyard, like the voice of the powerful God when he speaks.
\p
\v 6 When \add @Yahweh\add* had commanded the man dressed in linen, “Take fire from between the wheels that are between the winged creatures,” the man went in and stood beside a wheel.
\v 7 A winged creature reached out his hand between the winged creatures to the fire that was among \add *them\add*, and lifted it up and placed it into the hands of the one dressed in linen. The man took it and went back out.
\p
\v 8 I \add ≈noticed\add* that the winged creatures had something like a human hand under their wings,
\v 9 then I looked, and wow, four wheels were beside the winged creatures—one wheel beside each \add *one\add*—and the wheels seemed like shining chrysolite.\x + \xo 10:9-13: \xt Eze 1:15-21.\x*
\v 10 \add *They\add* all appeared to be the same, like having a wheel within a wheel.
\v 11 When they moved, they went in any of their four directions, without turning as they went, because whatever direction the head faced, they went in that direction without turning as they went.
\v 12 Their whole body (including their backs, their hands, and their wings) was covered with eyes, and eyes covered all around the four wheels as well.\x + \xo 10:12: \xt Rev 4:8.\x*
\v 13 I heard \add someone\add* call them ‘the whirling wheels’.
\p
\v 14 Each one had four faces: the first face was the face of a winged creature, the second was a man's face, the third was a lion's face, and the fourth was an eagle's face.\x + \xo 10:14: \xt Eze 1:10; Rev 4:7.\x*
\v 15 Then the living creatures (they were the same ones that I had seen by the Kebar channel) rose up \add in the air\add*.
\v 16 Whenever the winged creatures moved, the wheels would go beside them, and whenever the winged creatures lifted up their wings to go up from the earth, the wheels didn't turn—they still stayed beside them.
\v 17 When the winged creatures stood still, the wheels stood still, and when they went up, the wheels went up with them, because the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\p
\v 18 Then Yahweh's \add ≈brilliant light\add* went out over the \add ≈temple\add* threshold and stayed over the winged creatures.
\v 19 The winged creatures lifted up their wings and rose from the ground in my sight when they went out, and the wheels did the same beside them. They stood at the eastern entrance to Yahweh's residence, and the \add ≈brilliant light\add* of Yisrael's God came onto them from above.
\v 20 Those were the living creatures that I had seen below the Yisrael's God by the Kebar Canal, so I knew that they were winged creatures.
\p
\v 21 They each had four faces and four wings, and had something like human hands under their wings,

\v 16 and you'll become unclean in the eyes of the nations. Then you'll know that I am Yahweh.’ ”

\v 17 Then Yahweh \add ≈gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 18 “Humanity's child, the \add ≈Israeli people\add* have become like dross to me. All of them are the leftovers of bronze and tin, and iron and lead among you—they'll be like the dross from silver in your furnace.
\v 19 Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this, ‘Because all of you have become like dross, then listen: I'm about to gather you into the centre of Yerushalem.
\v 20 Just like men gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin, and put it inside a furnace to melt it then blast the fire onto it in order to melt it, so \add too\add* I'll gather you in my anger and my rage, and I'll put you in there and melt you.
\v 21 \add ≈Yes,\add* I'll gather you and blow my fire of fury onto you, and you'll be melted in the middle of it.
