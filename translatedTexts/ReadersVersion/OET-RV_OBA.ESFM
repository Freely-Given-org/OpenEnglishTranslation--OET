\is1 Introduction
\ip This short document was written by the prophet Ovadyah (three syllables, traditionally spelt as ‘Obadiah’) and is about God's judgement and punishment of Edom—the nation made up of Esau's descendants. Esau was Yacob's twin-brother—the sons of Yitshak (‘Isaac’), however the two sets of descendants ended up as enemies. So that's why Edom's people were very glad when the Babylonian army destroyed Yerushalem in 586 before Yeshua/Jesus (B.C.), and not just that, they took advantage of the invasion to join in looting the city and help the invaders. Here, God passes on through Ovadyah the declaration that Edom will be punished and defeated and their warriors would be slaughtered without any survivors, thus allowing Yisrael/Israel to recapture their lands.
