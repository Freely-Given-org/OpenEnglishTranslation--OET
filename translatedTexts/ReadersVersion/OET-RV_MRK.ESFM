\mt2 The account of Yeshua's ministry by
\mt1 Mark
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua was written by Mark, the son of a Jewish family who lived in Yerushalem. His mother was named Maria (Acts 12:12).
\ip Many people think he was Yohan Mark, a cousin of Barnabas (Col. 4:10) who accompanied Paul on his first long-distance trip to spread the good message about Yeshua the messiah (Acts 12:25, 13:13). We also know that Mark accompanied Peter (1 Peter 5:13), and some consider that it might have been Peter who narrated to Mark what Yeshua had done and taught.
\is2 This account
\ip This account seems to have been written for non-Jews, especially perhaps those familiar with Roman customs. So he didn't use as much ink as Matthew or Luke explaining prophecies from the Jewish scriptures but he does however, take time to explain Jewish customs to help non-Jewish readers.
\ip Mark explains here that Yeshua came to serve both God and the people, and he often refers to him as ‘humanity's child’ (traditionally translated very literally from the Greek as the ‘Son of Man’). We can see that especially in 10:45: “Even humanity's child didn't come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom to set many people free.” Mark wants his readers to know that Yeshua did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Yeshua by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons.
\ip The ending of this account is often disputed, and scholars are still \jmp debating|link-href="https://textandcanon.org/a-case-for-the-longer-ending-of-mark"\jmp* about whether or not the longer ending (16:9-20) is original. The \em OET\em* includes the disputed longer ending, but displays it in a lighter colour to indicate its debatable status.

\v 5 And many from the Yudean region¦21899 and from the city of Yerushalem went out to hear him, and they confessed¦21915 their¦21918 sins¦21917 and asked Yohan to immerse¦21905 them in the Yordan¦21911 river¦21912.

\rem /s1 Jesus Calls the First Disciples
\p
\v 16 As he went around the lake of Galilee¦22159, Yeshua saw¦22160 two fishermen¦22182, Simon¦22162 and his brother¦22166 Andrew¦22164 throwing¦22170 a net¦22170 into the lake.
\v 17 And he said¦22184 to them, “\wj Come with me and¦22191 I will make you¦22193 into fishermen¦22196 of people¦22197.\wj*”
\v 18 And so they¦22206 left their¦22203 fishing work and went off with Yeshua.
\p
\v 19 Then¦22209 a bit further on he saw¦22214 two of Zebedee's¦22218 sons, Yacob¦22215 and his¦22223 brother¦22222 Yohan¦22220, in a boat¦22228 getting their nets¦22231 ready.
\v 20 Yeshua called¦22235 them and they¦22254 too went¦22254 off with him¦22257, leaving their¦22242 father¦22241 Zebedee¦22243 in the boat¦22247 with the hired¦22250 workers.

\p
\v 21 They went on into Capernaum¦22263 where he went into the meeting¦22276 hall¦22276 and began teaching¦22277 as soon as the rest day started.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Mat 7:28-29.\x*The congregation was amazed¦22280 at his¦22284 teaching, because¦22286 he taught¦22283 with authority¦22290, not like the regular teachers¦22296 there.
\p
\v 23 Then¦22298 a demon-possessed¦22309 man¦22306 in the meeting¦22303 hall¦22303 suddenly yelled¦22312 out,
\v 24 “What are we to you, \nd Yeshua¦22320\nd* of \nd Nazareth¦22321\nd*? You've come to destroy¦22324 us. I know that you're¦22329 God's holy one.”
\p
\v 25 But¦22336 \nd Yeshua¦22340\nd* scolded it, saying¦22342, “\wj Keep quiet¦22344!\wj*”, and, “\wj Come out of him!\wj*”
\p
\v 26 Then¦22353 the demon¦22360 threw the man into a convulsion¦22355, cried out loudly¦22370, and left¦22373 him.
\v 27 Everyone was astounded¦22378 and asked each other, “What just happened? We haven't heard anything like this before—he has authority¦22406 to command¦22417 demons¦22416, and they obey¦22419 him!”
\p
\v 28 And the news¦22425 about Yeshua spread all over the entire¦22430 region¦22432 of Galilee¦22435.
\s1 Yeshua heals many others
\rem /s1 Jesus Heals Many at Simon's House
\r (Mat. 8:14-17; Luke 4:38-41)
\p
\v 29 After leaving the meeting¦22443 hall¦22443, Yeshua went¦22448 into the home of Simon¦22452 and Andrew¦22454, along with Yacob¦22456 and Yohan¦22458.
\v 30 Inside, Simon's mother-in-law¦22463 was lying¦22465 down with a fever¦22466, and the others spoke to Yeshua about¦22472 her.
\v 31 When he went up to her, and took hold of her hand¦22482 and helped her up, the fever¦22495 left her and she prepared something for them to eat.
\p
\v 32 That evening¦22502 when the sun¦22509 set, the people brought all those who were sick¦22516 or demon-possessed¦22522 to Yeshua.
\v 33 It seemed like the entire¦22525 town had gathered¦22529 there outside the front door¦22535.
\v 34 Yeshua healed¦22559 many who were sick¦22561 from a range¦22563 of diseases¦22564, and he commanded many demons to leave—not allowing¦22574 them to speak¦22578 because¦22579 they knew that he was the \nd messiah¦22583\nd*.
\s1 Yeshua prays before going preaching
\rem /s1 Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place; Jesus Preaches in Galilee; A Preaching Tour in Galilee
\r (Luke 4:42-44)
\p
\v 35 In the small hours of the morning, Yeshua got¦22591 up¦22591 and went¦22594 out to a quiet¦22597 place¦22598 and prayed¦22602 there¦22599.
\v 36 But¦22604 Simon¦22611 and the others came looking¦22606 for him,
\v 37 and when they found¦22618 him they said, “Everyone's looking¦22627 for¦22627 you!”
\p
\v 38 And Yeshua answered, “\wj Well, we'll be going¦22635 into the other villages¦22643 around here, so that I can also tell them. That's what I came¦22660 here for.\wj*”
\v 39 \x + \xo 1:39: \xt Mat 4:23; 9:35.\x*Then¦22662 he went¦22663 preaching¦22665 in all their¦22673 meeting¦22671 halls¦22671 in Galilee¦22677 and driving¦22681 out demons¦22680.
\s1 Yeshua heals a man with leprosy
\rem /s1 Jesus Cleanses a Leper; A Man With Leprosy
\r (Mat. 8:1-4; Luke 5:12-16)
\p
\v 40 A man with leprosy came to Yeshua asking him, “I know that you could heal me if you wanted to.”
\p
\v 41 Yeshua felt compassion¦22709 for him, reached out his¦22714 hand¦22713 and touched¦22715 him, and said, “\wj Yes, I will. Get well.\wj*”
\v 42 Then¦22723 immediately¦22727 the leprosy¦22735 disappeared and he was well again.
\v 43 So¦22738 Yeshua sent¦22744 him away, but warned him:
\v 44 \x + \xo 1:44: \xt Lev 14:1-32.\x*“\wj Don't talk to anyone¦22751—just go to the priest¦22762 and show him¦22749 that you're well, and as a testimony¦22777 of that, make the offering¦22764 that Mosheh commanded¦22774.\wj*”
\p
\v 45 But after the man left, he started telling lots of people and spreading¦22787 the news—so much so that Yeshua could no longer¦22791 come into the town but¦22781 had to stay out in quieter places¦22807, and people kept coming¦22810 to him.

\s1 Yeshua heals a paralysed man
\rem /s1 Jesus Heals a Paralytic
\r (Mat. 9:1-8; Luke 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 When Yeshua came back to Capernaum¦22822 after a few days¦22824, people soon heard¦22826 that he was back in the house¦22830.
\v 2 And so many people turned up there that there wasn't any room left—not even in the doorway. Inside, Yeshua was explaining the Scriptures to them.
\v 3 Four¦22868 men arrived, carrying¦22865 a paralysed¦22863 man to Yeshua,
\v 4 but because¦22876 of the crowd¦22880, they were unable to get close. So¦22869 they climbed up onto the flat roof¦22884, made a hole through it¦22890, and lowered¦22891 the paralysed¦22902 man lying¦22903 on a pallet¦22893.
\v 5 Yeshua, observing their¦22912 faith¦22911, said to the man, “\wj Son, your¦22922 sins are forgiven¦22919!\wj*”\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Yeshua's hearers would have taken this as a claim to be God, as they knew that only God could forgive sins.\f*
\p
\v 6 But some of the religious¦22931 teachers¦22931 were sitting¦22933 there¦22932, thinking¦22935 to themselves¦22938,
\v 7 “Why's he talking¦22945 like that? He's seriously insulting¦22947 God. There's only one who can forgive¦22950 sins¦22953, and that's God himself.”
\p
\v 8 Then¦22959 \nd Yeshua¦22964\nd*, knowing¦22962 in his¦22968 spirit¦22967 that they are thinking like that, said to them, “\wj Why are you thinking that to yourselves¦22986?\wj*
\v 9 \wj Which¦22988 is easier¦22991: to tell the paralysed¦22994 man that his sins¦23001 have been forgiven¦22997, or to tell him to pick up his bedding¦23011 and walk¦23015?\wj*
\v 10 \wj But so you all can see that humanity's child \+em does\+em* have authority¦23032 here on the earth¦23043 to forgive¦23044 sins¦23045,\wj*” he turned and said to the paralysed¦23048 man¦23038,
\v 11 “\wj Listen. Get up, take¦23055 your¦23059 bedding¦23057, and¦23060 go home¦23064!\wj*”
\p
\v 12 So¦23068 the man stood up, and picked up his bedding¦23080, and went¦23082 out of the house where everyone saw¦23104 him and marvelled¦23088 and praised¦23094 \nd God¦23096\nd* saying¦23098, “We've¦23104 never¦23103 seen anything happen like this before¦23083!”

\p
\v 13 Yeshua went¦23112 out beside¦23115 the lake¦23118 where crowds¦23122 of people kept coming¦23123 to him and he taught¦23128 them.
\v 14 And as he was passing¦23131 by the tax¦23143 office¦23143, he saw¦23132 Levi Alphaeus sitting¦23139 there and said to him, “Come along with me.” So¦23130 Levi stood up and followed¦23152 Yeshua.
\p
\v 15 Yeshua ended up having a meal at Levi's place, and many other tax¦23171 collectors¦23171 and undesirables¦23173 were sitting¦23160 there also, along with \nd Yeshua's¦23177\nd* followers, because¦23183 by then many were following¦23187 him around.
\v 16 And the teachers¦23192 from the Pharisee¦23197 party¦23197 noticed that Yeshua was eating beside undesirables¦23210 and tax-collectors. So¦23190 they asked his¦23219 followers, “How come he eats with tax-collectors and other low-life?”
\p
\v 17 And overhearing them, \nd Yeshua¦23241\nd* said, “\wj Healthy people don't¦23245 need a doctor¦23250—it's the sick¦23253 ones that do. I didn't¦23245 come here to help those who think they have no needs, but to call sinners¦23262.\wj*”

\p
\v 18 Now the followers of Yohan-the-immerser and members of the Pharisees regularly fasted. So¦23265 a small group came to Yeshua and asked, “How come Yohan's followers and the Pharisee¦23275 party fast regularly, yet your followers don't¦23298?”
\p
\v 19 And \nd Yeshua¦23304\nd* answered, “\wj Can the friends of the groom fast when they're celebrating along with him? No, as long¦23320 as he's still there, they won't¦23305 be fasting.\wj*
\v 20 \wj But in the future, the groom will be taken¦23338 away from them, and¦23343 \+em then\+em* they'll be fasting¦23345.\wj*
\p
\v 21 “\wj No one sews a patch of new, unshrunken¦23359 cloth¦23358 onto an old garment¦23364, because the new patch will tear away from that old fabric and it¦23376 will end up as a worse¦23385 tear.\wj*

\v 24 And some members of the Pharisee¦23469 party¦23469 said, “It's breaking the law to harvest grain on a rest day!”
\p
\v 25 And Yeshua replied, “\wj You've read yourselves what David¦23501 did when him¦23512 and his men were hungry.\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 2:26: \xt Lev 24:9.\x*\wj They went¦23515 into God's tent and ate¦23533 the holy bread¦23529 representing the presence¦23531 of God. Only the priests¦23551 were allowed to eat¦23545 that, and yet David even gave¦23553 some to his men!\wj*”
\v 27 And he told the Pharisees, “\wj The days of rest were created for people, not people for the rest days.\wj*

\p
\v 1 And again¦23594 another time, Yeshua went¦23591 to the meeting¦23597 hall¦23597 and there was a man¦23603 there with a curled-up hand¦23611.
\v 2 The religious leaders there were watching¦23613 him closely¦23613 to see if he would heal the man on the rest day, and then if he did, they would have a case against¦23627 him.
\v 3 Then¦23628 Yeshua said to the man¦23631 with the flawed hand¦23637, “\wj Stand up there in the middle.\wj*”
\v 4 And he asked the leaders, “\wj Is it allowable to do good¦23665 on the rest day, or only to do evil¦23669? To save¦23672 life¦23671, or to kill¦23676?\wj*” But¦23654 they didn't reply.
\p
\v 5 After angrily looking around¦23681 at them, grieving¦23686 at their¦23693 complete lack of compassion, he said to the man, “\wj Open up your¦23700 hand!\wj*”
\v 6 The man stretched out his fingers, and his hand became totally normal. But¦23715 the Pharisees quickly left, and meeting with King Herod's¦23724 supporters¦23724, they conspired to kill¦23735 Yeshua.

\v 7 After that, \nd Yeshua¦23739\nd* withdrew¦23745 towards the lake¦23749 with his¦23744 followers¦23758, and a huge¦23751 crowd¦23753 of people¦23753 from the regions of both Galilee¦23757 and down in Yudea¦23764,
\v 8 along with others from Yerushalem¦23768, Idumea¦23772, from across the Yordan¦23777 River, and from up near Tyre¦23781 and Tsidon. They came¦23796 because they had heard about the amazing things he had done.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9-10: \xt Mrk 4:1; Luk 5:1-3.\x*So¦23800 Yeshua asked his¦23804 apprentices¦23803 to organise a small¦23806 boat¦23806 to be there for him so he wouldn't be cramped by the press of the crowd¦23812.
\v 10 Virtually anyone who had any physical issues was pressing¦23823 towards him to touch¦23830 him, because¦23819 he¦23820 had already healed¦23820 so many.
\v 11 And the demons¦23841, whenever¦23842 they saw Yeshua, they fell down to the ground in front of him and yelled out, “You are God's son!”
\v 12 But¦23865 he regularly warned them not to reveal who he was.

\v 13 As Yeshua started climbing up a hill, he called the followers that he had selected, and they went¦23897 off with him.

\v 20 Then¦24036 Yeshua was approaching a house¦24041, but the crowd¦24046 swarmed them again¦24044 so they had no opportunity to eat¦24055.
\v 21 The ones with him heard¦24058 all the noise and came¦24069 to get him, because they were wondering if he was crazy.
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Mat 9:34; 10:25.\x*The religious¦24083 teachers¦24083 had come¦24087 up from Yerushalem¦24086 and were complaining, “He's possessed by the prince of demons. He can command them because he rules them!”
\p
\v 23 But¦24109 Yeshua addressed them: “\wj How could Satan¦24123 command himself?\wj*
\v 24 \wj If a kingdom is divided¦24132 against¦24130 itself¦24131, that kingdom could never prosper.\wj*
\v 25 \wj If a household is divided¦24145 against¦24143 itself¦24144, that family will never prosper.\wj*

\v 2 \add ≈From there\add*, he taught¦24457 them many different things in parables¦24461, including this one:
\v 3 “\wj Listen¦24474. Once there was a farmer who went¦24475 to spread some seed.\wj*
\v 4 \wj As he spread it, some landed on the path, and the birds¦24498 came and fed on it.\wj*
\v 5 \wj Some landed on a rocky¦24513 part without a lot of soil, and it¦24519 quickly sprouted in the warm, shallow soil,\wj*
\v 6 \wj but when the sun¦24544 came up, it dried out because¦24548 the roots weren't deep, and so it just withered¦24553 up.\wj*
\v 7 \wj Some of the seed landed in a thistle patch, and the thistles grew and choked¦24569 it out, so the plants never bore a crop.\wj*
\v 8 \wj But¦24577 some seed landed in fertile soil and it bore a harvest—some of it multiplying thirty¦24603 times, some sixty¦24609, and some a hundred¦24615 times.\wj*”

\r (Mat. 13:18-23; Luke 8:11-15)
\p
\v 13 Then¦24709 Yeshua said to them, “\wj If you didn't¦24712 understand this parable¦24715, how will you understand any others?\wj*
\v 14 \wj The person spreading seed is spreading the good message¦24728,\wj*
\v 15 \wj and there are some along¦24735 the path where¦24739 the good message is being¦24740 spread, who hear, but Satan¦24752 turns up immediately¦24748 and snatches the message from them.\wj*
\v 16 \wj Similarly, there's some seed that falls onto rocky¦24780 places¦24780 where the people who hear¦24786 the good message¦24788 happily accept it¦24794,\wj*
\v 17 \wj but don't¦24796 make strong roots—just temporary¦24802 \+add changes\+add*. So when they get mocked or attacked about accepting the good message¦24812, they quickly stumble¦24816.\wj*
\v 18 \wj Others are the ones where the seed was spread among¦24825 the thistles. They heard¦24837 the good message¦24835,\wj*
\v 19 \wj but contemporary topics, or the lure of money, or the appetite for other¦24861 things, choke their good intentions and the message¦24866 becomes¦24870 unfruitful¦24868 in them.\wj*
\v 20 \wj But¦24873 lastly, the seed that landed on the good soil represents the people who hear¦24888 the good message¦24890, accept¦24892 it, and are fruitful¦24894 thirty¦24899, sixty¦24903, or even a hundred¦24907 times over.\wj*”

\v 36 So¦25226 they left the crowd¦25231 behind and got into the boat¦25239 with him.

\p
\v 1 So¦25374 they¦25375 got \add safely\add* to the region¦25388 of Gerasenes¦25390 on the other side of the lake¦25383.
\v 2 As Yeshua climbed out of the boat¦25402, a demon-possessed¦25415 man¦25412 came out of the tombs¦25411 to meet him.
\v 3 He lived in those tombs¦25424, and¦25425 no one could tie him¦25436 up, not even with chains¦25428,
\v 4 because¦25440 he had often¦25443 been tied up in the past with shackles and chains but had always pulled the chains apart¦25456 and smashed the shackles, and no one was able to subdue him.
\v 5 All through¦25482 the day¦25487 and night¦25484, whether in the tombs¦25492 or up in the hills, he was yelling out and hurting himself¦25505 with stones¦25507.
\p
\v 6 So¦25508 when he had seen¦25509 \nd Yeshua¦25512\nd* in the distance, he ran¦25515 and \add as a sign of honour\add* fell to the ground in front of him.
\v 7 Then he called out very loudly¦25524, “What will happen between us, \nd Yeshua¦25532\nd*, the son of the highest¦25537 God? I beg you in God's name not to torment¦25545 me.”
\v 8 Because¦25548 Yeshua had already started saying¦25547, “\wj Come out of the man¦25561 you ungodly¦25556 spirit¦25554!\wj*”
\p
\v 9 Yeshua asked, “\wj What's¦25566 your¦25569 name?\wj*”
\p The man answered, “My name is ‘Thousands’ because¦25584 there's many of us,”
\v 10 and he begged Yeshua not to send¦25597 them out of the country¦25602.
\p
\v 11 It just so happened that there¦25605 was a large herd of pigs being¦25617 fed on the hill nearby
\v 12 and¦25622 they¦25623 begged Yeshua again saying¦25633, “Send us to the pigs so that we¦25644 can enter them.”
\v 13 Yeshua agreed to that, so the ungodly¦25663 spirits¦25661 came out of the man, went¦25664 into the pigs, and the entire herd of some two thousand¦25683 pigs rushed¦25671 down the steep¦25676 bank into the sea and were drowned¦25685.
\p
\v 14 The ones who had been feeding¦25692 them rushed off and spread the news around in the city¦25705 and the surrounding area. So¦25689 the people hurried out to see¦25713 what had happened.
\v 15 When they arrived where \nd Yeshua¦25723\nd* was, they saw the man who had been demon-possessed¦25729 fully-clothed and sitting¦25730 there in full control of his senses. They knew it was the man called ‘Thousands’ and they became frightened.
\v 16 Those who had seen¦25747 it all happen described¦25743 it all to the people—what had happened both to the demon-possessed¦25753 man and to the pigs.
\p
\v 17 So¦25758 then the people began¦25759 asking Yeshua to go¦25764 away from their¦25769 region¦25768.
\p
\v 18 As Yeshua was climbing back into the boat¦25776, the man who had been demon-possessed¦25782 wanted to go with him.
\p
\v 19 But¦25791 Yeshua wouldn't let him and told him to head back home¦25804 to his own people¦25808, and explain to them what the \nd Master¦25818\nd* had done for him and how he had been merciful to him.
\p
\v 20 So¦25828 he went¦25829 away and shared with the people of the Ten Cities region what \nd Yeshua¦25842\nd* had done for him, and they were all amazed¦25845.

\v 21 When \nd Yeshua¦25850\nd* had crossed¦25847 in the boat¦25853 to the other side of the lake, a large crowd¦25863 of people came out to the lake edge to see him¦25867.

\v 23 and pleaded, “My¦25905 young daughter¦25904 is critical and just hanging on for you¦25912 to come¦25909 and touch her¦25922 so that she¦25925 can be healed¦25925 and live¦25927.”

\v 24 So¦25929 Yeshua went¦25931 off with Jairus. The large crowd¦25938 followed¦25935 also and¦25940 many were getting pressed¦25941 against Yeshua.
\p
\v 25 Then¦25943 a woman¦25944 came who had been losing blood¦25949 for twelve¦25951 years¦25952
\v 26 and who had endured much under¦25957 various doctors¦25959 despite spending everything she had. After all that, she'd ended up even worse¦25975,

\v 28 because¦25999 she¦25997 had told herself, “If I could even just touch¦26004 his¦26012 clothes, I would be healed¦26014.”
\p
\v 29 And immediately¦26016 the bleeding stopped and she knew¦26025 that she had been healed¦26029.
\v 30 Immediately also, \nd Yeshua¦26040\nd* knew that power¦26047 had gone out of him, and he turned¦26052 back towards the crowd¦26055 and said, “\wj Who touched¦26060 my¦26059 clothes¦26062?\wj*”
\p
\v 31 But¦26064 his¦26070 followers said, “You can see all the people that were pressing¦26076 on you so why would you ask who touched¦26083 you?”
\p
\v 32 But¦26084 Yeshua was still looking¦26085 around¦26085 to see¦26086 who had done it.
\v 33 And the woman¦26094, scared and shaking because of what was happening, came¦26107 and fell down in front of Yeshua and told him the whole story.
\v 34 Yeshua said¦26126, “\wj Daughter¦26129, your¦26133 faith¦26132 has healed¦26134 you. Go in peace¦26138 and full health¦26141.\wj*”
\p
\v 35 While he was still¦26161 speaking¦26148, messengers came from Jairus' house to tell him, “Your¦26158 daughter¦26157 has died¦26159. Why bother the teacher¦26164 any more?”
\p
\v 36 But \nd Yeshua¦26167\nd* overheard¦26169 them telling this to the leader¦26178 and told him, “\wj Don't be afraid—keep believing¦26182.\wj*”
\v 37 And Yeshua didn't¦26184 allow¦26185 anyone¦26186 to accompany¦26196 him¦26191 other than Peter¦26201, and Yacob¦26208 and his brother¦26207, Yohan¦26205.
\v 38 As they¦26211 approached Jairus' house¦26216, Yeshua saw a big commotion¦26223 with lots of crying and yelling going on.
\v 39 As he entered, he said, “\wj Why are you all crying in distress¦26237? The child¦26242 hasn't died¦26244—she's just sleeping¦26246!\wj*”
\p
\v 40 But¦26249 they just ridiculed¦26250 Yeshua. So¦26249 he sent them all outside, just taking¦26264 the father¦26266 and mother¦26274 of the child, along with three with him. He went in where¦26285 the girl was
\v 41 and taking her hand¦26295, he said, “\wj Young woman, I tell you: get up!\wj*”
\v 42 Immediately she got up and walked around. And everyone marvelled¦26331 at the amazing thing that had happened. (She was twelve¦26329 years¦26328 old.)

\v 14 \x + \xo 6:14-15: \xt Mat 16:14; Mrk 8:28; Luk 9:19.\x*Yeshua was now becoming well known and King Herod¦26676 \add Antipas\add* heard¦26672 about him. He thought that maybe Yohan-the-immerser had come back to life and that's why he was able to do miracles¦26703.
\p
\v 15 But others thought it was \add the promised return of\add* Eliyyah, and¦26714 yet others thought he must be another prophet¦26717 like the ones \add in the Scriptures\add*.
\p
\v 16 But hearing about Yeshua, Herod¦26727 was telling people, “That Yohan¦26735 who I had beheaded¦26734, he must have come back to life!”
\v 17 \x + \xo 6:17-18: \xt Luk 3:19-20.\x*Because¦26749 Herod¦26751 himself¦26747 had had Yohan¦26755 arrested and put in prison¦26766 because¦26749 he had married¦26779 Herodias¦26769, his¦26775 brother¦26774 Philip's¦26772 wife¦26771.
\v 18 Yohan¦26784 had been telling him that it was wrong for him to marry his brother's¦26798 wife¦26795,
\v 19 and so Herodias¦26802 resented¦26804 him enough to want to kill¦26811 him, but Herod hadn't be able to
\v 20 because¦26818 he respected Yohan as a righteous¦26826 and holy teacher and so he kept him alive. He often enjoyed hearing¦26843 from Yohan and thought a lot about what he said.
\p
\v 21 However, an opportunity¦26848 came at Herod's¦26850 birthday¦26853 celebration¦26853, when he threw a feast for his¦26854 top officials and generals and for the leaders¦26866 in Galilee¦26868.
\v 22 The daughter¦26874 of Herodias¦26878 came in and danced¦26880 for them, and the king and his party guests all enjoyed it. So¦26869 the king said to the young woman, “Just ask me for anything and I'll give it to you.”
\v 23 And he made an oath, “Even if you asked for half of my¦26932 kingdom¦26931, I'd give it to you!”
\p
\v 24 So¦26935 she went out and asked her mother what she should ask for. Her¦26940 mother told her that she should ask for Yohan's head.
\p
\v 25 So¦26955 going back into the party, she¦26965 said seriously to the king¦26964, “I would like the head of Yohan-the-immerser on a plate!”
\p
\v 26 The king¦26989 was really upset with that, but because¦26992 he had made loud oaths¦26994 in front of all his guests, he couldn't say no.
\v 27 So¦27005 he ordered an executioner¦27012 to go out and return with Yohan's head. He went off and beheaded¦27026 him in the prison¦27030
\v 28 and brought¦27032 the head into the party on a plate and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her¦27051 mother¦27050.
\v 29 When Yohan's followers heard¦27053 about this, they came¦27058 and fetched his¦27057 body and put it into a tomb¦27072.

\v 30 Now the apprentices who had been sent out returned back to \nd Yeshua¦27079\nd* and they reported¦27081 back everything they had done and what they had been teaching \add people\add*.
\v 31 Then¦27093 he told them, “\wj Let's just all of us head for a quiet¦27106 place¦27107 and take a break.\wj*” This was because¦27115 there were so many people always coming¦27117 and going¦27120, and sometimes they didn't¦27123 even have a chance to eat¦27124.
\v 32 So¦27129 they¦27131 went¦27131 by boat¦27136 away to a quiet¦27140 place¦27141 by themselves¦27145.
\p
\v 33 But¦27146 people from towns all around had seen them going¦27151 and recognised¦27157 who they were, so they ran¦27169 around the lake on foot¦27162 and got there¦27170 ahead¦27172 of them.
\v 34 \x + \xo 6:34: \xt Num 27:17; 1Ki 22:17; 2Ch 18:16; Eze 34:5; Mat 9:36.\x*So¦27180 when Yeshua got out of the boat, he saw¦27185 a big crowd¦27190 and felt sorry for them because¦27199 they seemed like sheep¦27202 without a shepherd¦27205, so he started teaching¦27209 them many things.
\v 35 Then¦27213, when it was already getting late, his¦27224 apprentices¦27223 came up and said, “This place¦27233 is pretty isolated and it's already late.
\v 36 Send these people off now so they can go to the nearby settlements and villages¦27251 and buy themselves¦27254 something¦27257 to eat¦27259.”
\p
\v 37 But¦27276 Yeshua answered¦27266 them, “\wj You give them something to eat.\wj*”
\p They complained, “If we go, should we buy several months wages worth of bread so we can give all of them something to eat?”
\p
\v 38 But¦27300 he¦27298 asked, “\wj Go and find out how much bread you¦27307 have.\wj*”
\p When they'd found out they said, “Five buns and two¦27320 fish.”
\p
\v 39 Yeshua told all the people to line up in rows and sit¦27327 down on the green¦27338 grass¦27339.
\v 40 So¦27340 they sat¦27342 down in rows of fifty¦27352 to a hundred¦27348.
\v 41 Then¦27353 holding the five buns and two fish, he looking up to the sky¦27365 and blessed¦27366 \add God\add*, and then broke¦27370 up the buns and gave pieces to his¦27378 apprentices¦27377 so they could do likewise to the people, and he also divided¦27389 up the two fish,
\v 42 and all the people ate¦27392 and were satisfied¦27395.
\v 43 Then¦27396 they¦27397 collected the leftover pieces of bread, filling¦27403 twelve¦27400 baskets¦27402, as well as the leftover pieces of fish.

\v 46 Then¦27450 he said goodbye¦27451 to everyone, and climbed the hill to pray.
\v 47 Later in the night, the boat¦27464 was out in the middle of the lake¦27470, and only Yeshua remained back there on the land.
\v 48 He saw them struggling to row against the wind¦27493, and sometime after 3am he came out to them, walking¦27508 on the lake¦27513 surface as if to walk¦27508 past them.

\v 50 because¦27538 they had all seen it and were terrified.
\p But¦27546 Yeshua immediately¦27547 spoke¦27549 to them and said, “\wj Hey, take heart, it's me, don't¦27561 be afraid!\wj*”
\v 51 Then¦27565 he climbed up into the boat¦27571 and the wind¦27577 died¦27575 down. And they were all totally astounded

\p
\v 1 Some from the Pharisee¦27723 party¦27723 and¦27724 some of the law teachers¦27727 had come¦27728 from Yerushalem¦27730 to observe Yeshua
\v 2 and¦27731 noticed that some of his¦27738 followers were eating¦27747 their food without following their religious customs, i.e., without washing their hands¦27742.
\v 3 (The Pharisees and¦27756, in fact, all the Jewish religious leaders do not eat without first ceremonially washing their hands¦27766 as taught by their elders¦27776 over the generations.
\v 4 They won't¦27787 eat at the market¦27779 if they can't¦27787 do this first, and have many other¦27790 regulations about ceremonial washing¦27800 of cups and jugs and copper¦27805 kettles¦27805.)
\p
\v 5 And the Pharisees and¦27815 religious¦27817 teachers¦27817 asked Yeshua, “How come your¦27825 followers don't¦27826 follow our Jewish traditions¦27830, but¦27833 eat without the ceremonial washing of hands¦27839?”
\p
\v 6 And he answered¦27845, “\wj Isayah¦27852 got it exactly right¦27849 when he expressed God's thoughts about you hypocrites¦27857 and wrote¦27860:\wj*\x + \xo 7:6-7: \xt Isa 29:13 (LXX).\x*

\v 19 \wj because¦28128 it doesn't enter¦28132 your mind¦28137 but merely goes into your stomach and ends up in the toilet.\wj*” (By saying this he clearly showed that is was ok for Jews to eat any food.)
\p
\v 20 He continued, “\wj It's what comes out of you that makes you guilty in God's eyes.\wj*

\v 26 The woman¦28282 was Greek¦28284 from Phoenicia¦28286 in Syria and¦28292 she¦28293 begged Yeshua to command the demon¦28297 to leave her¦28304 daughter¦28303.
\v 27 But¦28306 he replied, “\wj Let the \+add Jewish\+add* children be treated first¦28314, because¦28319 it's not good to take the children's food and throw¦28332 it to the dogs.\wj*”

\p
\v 5 He asked, “\wj How much bread have you¦28674 all got?\wj*”
\p “Seven¦28681 buns,” they¦28677 answered.

\v 1 As they¦31913 got close to Yerushalem¦31916 and were passing Bethphage¦31920 and Bethany¦31924 on the Mount¦31927 of Olives¦31930, Yeshua sent two¦31933 of his¦31936 apprentices¦31935 ahead, telling them,
\v 2 “\wj Go on to the next village¦31946 and as you enter¦31953 it, you'll see a young donkey that hasn't ever been ridden yet. Untie it and bring¦31977 it back here.\wj*

\p
\v 4 So¦32009 they went ahead and found¦32014 a donkey tied up on the path just outside¦32021 the door¦32020 of a house, and so they went to untie it.
\v 5 But¦32028 some of the people standing around there¦32032 said, “Hoy! What do you think you're doing¦32038 untying that donkey?”
\p
\v 6 So¦32043 they responded just as \nd Yeshua¦32053\nd* had told them, and the people allowed¦32055 them to proceed.
\v 7 They brought the young donkey to Yeshua, placing their¦32074 coats¦32072 over it before Yeshua mounted it.

\p
\v 11 And so Yeshua arrived in Yerushalem¦32151 and went into the temple¦32157 and looked¦32159 all around¦32159, but because it was now evening¦32161, he went back out to Bethania village with his twelve¦32173 apprentices.

\v 2 \wj At harvest time, he sent a slave¦32766 to go to the tenant farmers and get his \+add percentage\+add* of the harvest.\wj*

\v 6 \wj But the owner still¦32838 had his one, dearly loved son, so finally he sent¦32850 him to go, thinking that they would now be convinced because it was his son.\wj*
\v 7 \wj But the tenant¦32868 farmers¦32868 said¦32876 to each others, ‘Ah ha. This is the one who will inherit¦32889 this land. If we kill¦32883 \+em him¦32884\+em*, we'll be the ones to control the estate.’\wj*
\v 8 \wj So¦32890 they took him and killed¦32893 him, and threw the body outside¦32899 the vineyard¦32901 fence.\wj*
\p
\v 9 “\wj Now, what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? Yes, he'll come and eliminate those \+add evil\+add* tenants¦32913, and give the contract to others¦32918.\wj*

\v 72 Right then the rooster crowed¦36191 for the second¦36189 time¦36189 and Peter¦36196 remembered now what Yeshua had told him—how he would renounce¦36219 Yeshua three¦36217 times before the rooster crowed—and he broke¦36222 down and cried.

\p
\v 1 First thing in the morning¦36231, the chief¦36237 priests¦36237 called a meeting with the elders¦36240 and the religious¦36244 teachers¦36244 and all the council¦36249, and they ordered that \nd Yeshua¦36253\nd* be tied up and taken over to Governor Pilate¦36263.
\v 2 There Pilate¦36268 asked¦36265 him, “Are you the king¦36273 of the Jews¦36275?”
\p “\wj You said it¦36284,\wj*” replied Yeshua.
\p
\v 3 Then¦36285 the chief¦36290 priests¦36290 started hurling accusations¦36286 against¦36288 Yeshua,
\v 4 so¦36297 Pilate¦36298 asked¦36300 him¦36302 again, “Don't you have anything to say? Listen¦36308 to all these accusations¦36312 they're making against you.”
\p
\v 5 But Pilate¦36323 was astounded that \nd Yeshua¦36316\nd* didn't answer¦36319 any further.

\p
\v 6 Now at time of the Jewish Passover, Pilate would normally pardon one prisoner¦36335 for them and release him.
\v 7 There was another prisoner at the time named Barabbas¦36347 who was an activist accused of murder¦36357.
\v 8 By now, the crowd¦36366 had arrived and asked Pilate to release a prisoner as usual at Passover,
\v 9 so he asked them, “Do you want me to release the King of the Jews¦36389 for you?”
\v 10 (This was because Pilate was well aware that the chief¦36402 priests¦36402 had brought Yeshua because they were jealous of his \add popularity\add*.)
\v 11 But the chief¦36405 priests¦36405 stirred¦36407 up the crowd¦36410 to start saying that it was Barabbas¦36416 that they wanted released,
\v 12 so¦36429 Pilate¦36421 asked again¦36422, “Then¦36420 what should I do with this man that you¦36433 call the King of the Jews¦36438?”
\p
\v 13 The crowd yelled¦36442 back, “Execute¦36445 him¦36446 on a pole.”
\p
\v 14 “What has he even done wrong?” Pilate¦36449 demanded.
\p But¦36448 they just yelled¦36461 louder, “Execute¦36464 him on a pole!”
\p
\v 15 Now Pilate¦36468 wanted to placate the crowd¦36471, so he had Barabbas¦36482 released while he had \nd Yeshua¦36488\nd* flogged¦36489 and then handed over to the execution¦36493 squad.

\v 16 So¦36495 the soldiers¦36496 led Yeshua inside the palace¦36503 that was the governor's¦36507 residence¦36507, and¦36508 called in the rest of the battalion.
\v 17 They \add mocked Yeshua\add* by dressing¦36515 him in a kingly robe, and after someone twisted¦36523 some thorns¦36524 together¦36523 into a mock crown¦36525, they pressed it onto his head,
\v 18 and¦36526 began¦36527 saluting him¦36529, “Greetings¦36532, king¦36535 of the Jews¦36537.”
\v 19 They took turns whacking his¦36540 head with a stick and spitting¦36549 on him, while others knelt down in front of him and pretended to be bowing to him.
\v 20 After they'd finished having fun mocking¦36560 him, they took the purple¦36565 robe off him, and put his¦36572 own robe back on him. Then¦36558 they led him outside towards the execution¦36580 spot.

\v 21 \x + \xo 15:21: \xt Rom 16:13.\x*As they walked out of the city, they came across a man¦36587 coming¦36593 in from the country¦36596. He was Simon¦36589 from Cyrene¦36592, the father¦36598 of Alexander¦36599 and Rufus¦36601, and the soldiers forced him¦36606 to carry¦36603 the execution¦36605 pole,
\v 22 and so they¦36609 all arrived at Golgotha¦36615 (which¦36617 means ‘Place¦36622 of the skull¦36622’).
\v 23 There the soldiers went to give some spiced wine to Yeshua, but¦36634 he¦36636 declined it.
\v 24 \x + \xo 15:24: \xt Psa 22:18.\x*So¦36637 they¦36642 carried out the execution¦36638, taking Yeshua's clothes¦36645 and¦36652 drawing straws to see who would get what.
\v 25 By now it¦36655 was around 9am, and¦36660 they¦36662 affixed Yeshua to the pole.
\v 26 The charge¦36670 had been written out and attached \add at the top\add*: “The king¦36676 of the Jews¦36678.”
\v 27 That morning, two¦36685 thieves were also executed¦36682 there—one on each side of Yeshua.

\v 30 come¦36735 down from that pole and save¦36731 yourself¦36732.”
\p
\v 31 Similarly¦36739 the chief¦36743 priests¦36743 and the religious¦36750 teachers¦36750 laughed together and mocked, “He did miracles for others¦36752, but he can't¦36755 even save¦36757 himself¦36754.
\v 32 The so-called ‘\nd chosen¦36759\nd* one’ or ‘king¦36761 of Israel¦36763’. Now, if he'd just come¦36764 down from there, then we'd be able to believe¦36773 him.”

\v 34 \x + \xo 15:34: \xt Psa 22:1.\x*when \nd Yeshua¦36808\nd* shouted¦36806 loudly¦36810, “\wj My¦36825 God, my¦36825 God, why have you¦36832 abandoned¦36832 me?\wj*”

\v 36 \x + \xo 15:36: \xt Psa 69:21.\x*One of them ran, and soaked a sponge¦36858 in some sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Yeshua to drink¦36864, saying¦36866, “Hang on. Let's see¦36870 if Eliyyah does come to get him down.”
\p
\v 37 But¦36877 just then \nd Yeshua¦36878\nd* uttered a loud¦36881 cry¦36880 and exhaled his last breath.

\p
\v 42 As evening¦36982 came, it was now the Preparation Day, i.e., the day before the Rest Day.
\v 43 Yosef¦36997 (who'd come¦36995 from the city of Arimathea¦37000 and one who was waiting¦37009 for the coming of God's¦37019 kingdom¦37011), a prominent¦37002 council¦37003 member¦37003, steeled himself¦37007 up and went¦37016 in to see the governor to get permission to transfer \nd Yeshua's¦37026\nd* body¦37024.
\v 44 Governor Pilate¦37029 didn't think he'd be dead yet, so he called¦37038 an army commander to find out if Yeshua had indeed died.
\v 45 As soon as he found out, he gave Yosef¦37063 permission,
\v 46 so¦37065 Yosef \add and his companions\add* went and bought¦37068 some linen burial cloth and then, removing Yeshua's body from the pole, wrapped¦37076 it in the cloth and placed it in a burial chamber that had been chiselled into a rockface. Then¦37065 they rolled¦37099 a rock¦37097 across the opening.
\v 47 Others were watching and noted where¦37128 the body had been laid, including Maria from Magdala¦37114 and Maria who was Yoses' mother¦37117.

\p
\v 1 After the Rest Day was over, Maria from Magdala¦37139 and Maria the mother¦37142 of Yacob¦37144 and Salome¦37146, went and bought¦37148 some traditional burial spices¦37149 that evening to take to the burial chamber and place with the body.
\v 2 Then¦37156 very early¦37159 on Sunday morning they¦37167 went to the chamber, arriving just as the sun¦37176 was rising.
\v 3 But¦37177 they realised that they didn't have anyone with them to roll the rock¦37191 away that was covering the entrance.
\v 4 However, when they looked¦37199 they saw that the very large¦37211 rock¦37207 had already been rolled¦37203 away.
\v 5 So¦37221 they went on into the burial chamber and were totally stunned to find a young¦37229 man¦37229 dressed in white¦37237, sitting¦37231 in there on the side.
\p
\v 6 He assured them, “Don't be surprised. I know you're looking¦37257 for¦37257 \nd Yeshua¦37256\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦37259\nd*, the one who was executed¦37262 on a pole. But¦37243 see¦37267 there where¦37275 his body was—he's not there because he came back to life.
\v 7 \x + \xo 16:7: \xt Mat 26:32; Mrk 14:28.\x*So you three should go and tell his¦37284 apprentices, and Peter¦37287 in particular, that he's going to go up ahead of them to Galilee¦37295 and you'll all see him up there¦37296, just as he already told you.”
\p
