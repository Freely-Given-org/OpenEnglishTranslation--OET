\mt2 The account of Yeshua's ministry by
\mt1 Mark
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua was written by Mark, the son of a Jewish family who lived in Yerusalem. His mother was named Maria (Acts 12:12).
\ip Many people think he was Yohan Mark, a cousin of Barnabas (Col. 4:10) who accompanied Paul on his first long-distance trip to spread the good message about Yeshua the messiah (Acts 12:25, 13:13). We also know that Mark accompanied Peter (1 Peter 5:13), and some consider that it might have been Peter who narrated to Mark what Yeshua had done and taught.
\is2 This account
\ip This account seems to have been written for non-Jews, especially perhaps those familiar with Roman customs. So he didn't use as much ink as Matthew or Luke explaining prophecies from the Jewish scriptures but he does however, take time to explain Jewish customs to help non-Jewish readers.
\ip Mark explains here that Yeshua came to serve both God and the people, and he often refers to him as ‘humanity's child’ (traditionally translated very literally from the Greek as the ‘Son of Man’). We can see that especially in 10:45: “Even humanity's child didn't come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom to set many people free.” Mark wants his readers to know that Yeshua did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Yeshua by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons.
\ip The ending of this account is often disputed, and scholars are still \jmp debating|link-href="https://textandcanon.org/a-case-for-the-longer-ending-of-mark"\jmp* about whether or not the longer ending (16:9-20) is original. The \em OET\em* includes the disputed longer ending, but displays it in a lighter colour to indicate its debatable status.

\v 5 And many from the Yudean region¦21899 and from the city of Yerusalem went out to hear him, and they confessed¦21915 their¦21918 sins¦21917 and asked Yohan to immerse¦21905 them in the Yordan¦21911 river¦21912.

\p
\v 14 After Yohan¦22114 had been arrested, \nd Yeshua¦22117\nd* went back up to Galilee¦22120 announcing¦22121 the good¦22123 news from \nd God¦22127\nd*

\rem /s1 Jesus Calls the First Disciples
\p
\v 16 As he went around the lake of Galilee¦22159, Yeshua saw¦22160 two fishermen¦22182, Simon¦22162 and his brother¦22166 Andrew¦22164 throwing¦22170 a net¦22170 into the lake.
\v 17 And he said¦22184 to them, “\wj Come with me and¦22191 I will make you¦22193 into fishermen¦22196 of people¦22197.\wj*”
\v 18 And so they¦22206 left their¦22203 fishing work and went off with Yeshua.
\p
\v 19 Then a bit further on he saw¦22214 two of Zebedee's¦22218 sons, Yacob¦22215 and his¦22223 brother¦22222 Yohan¦22220, in a boat¦22228 getting their nets¦22231 ready.
\v 20 Yeshua called¦22235 them and they¦22254 too went¦22254 off with him¦22257, leaving their¦22242 father¦22241 Zebedee¦22243 in the boat¦22247 with the hired¦22250 workers.

\rem /s1 The Man with an Unclean Spirit; Jesus Casts Out an Evil Spirit; A Man with an Evil Spirit; Jesus Drives Out an Evil Spirit

\p
\v 21 They went on into Capernaum¦22263 where he went into the meeting¦22276 hall¦22276 and began teaching¦22277 as soon as the rest day started.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Mat 7:28-29.\x*The congregation was amazed¦22280 at his¦22284 teaching, because¦22286 he taught¦22283 with authority¦22290, not like the regular teachers¦22296 there.
\p
\v 23 Then a demon-possessed¦22309 man¦22306 in the meeting¦22303 hall¦22303 suddenly yelled¦22312 out,
\v 24 “What are we to you, \nd Yeshua¦22320\nd* of Nazareth¦22321? You've come to destroy¦22324 us. I know that you're¦22329 God's holy one.”
\p
\v 25 But \nd Yeshua¦22340\nd* scolded it, saying¦22342, “\wj Keep quiet¦22344!\wj*”, and, “\wj Come out of him!\wj*”
\p
\v 26 Then the demon¦22360 threw the man into a convulsion¦22355, cried out loudly¦22370, and left¦22373 him.
\v 27 Everyone was astounded¦22378 and asked each other, “What just happened? We haven't heard anything like this before—he has authority¦22406 to command¦22417 demons¦22416, and they obey¦22419 him!”
\p
\v 28 And the news¦22425 about Yeshua spread all over the entire¦22430 region¦22432 of Galilee¦22435.
\s1 Yeshua heals many others
\rem /s1 Jesus Heals Many at Simon's House
\r (Mat. 8:14-17; Luke 4:38-41)
\p
\v 29 After leaving the meeting¦22443 hall¦22443, Yeshua went into the home of Simon¦22452 and Andrew¦22454, along with Yacob¦22456 and Yohan¦22458.
\v 30 Inside, Simon's mother-in-law¦22463 was lying¦22465 down with a fever¦22466, and the others spoke to Yeshua about¦22472 her.
\v 31 When he went up to her, and took hold of her hand¦22482 and helped her up, the fever¦22495 left her and she prepared something for them to eat.
\p
\v 32 That evening¦22502 when the sun¦22509 set, the people brought all those who were sick¦22516 or demon-possessed¦22522 to Yeshua.
\v 33 It seemed like the entire¦22525 town had gathered¦22529 there outside the front door¦22535.
\v 34 Yeshua healed¦22559 many who were sick¦22561 from a range¦22563 of diseases¦22564, and he commanded many demons to leave—not allowing¦22574 them to speak¦22578 because¦22579 they knew that he was the \nd messiah¦22583\nd*.
\s1 Yeshua prays before going preaching
\rem /s1 Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place; Jesus Preaches in Galilee; A Preaching Tour in Galilee
\r (Luke 4:42-44)
\p
\v 35 In the small hours of the morning, Yeshua got¦22591 up¦22591 and went¦22594 out to a quiet¦22597 place¦22598 and prayed¦22602 there¦22599.
\v 36 But Simon¦22611 and the others came looking¦22606 for him,
\v 37 and when they found¦22618 him they said, “Everyone's looking¦22627 for¦22627 you!”
\p
\v 38 And Yeshua answered, “\wj Well, we'll be going¦22635 into the other villages¦22643 around here, so that I can also tell them. That's what I came¦22660 here for.\wj*”
\v 39 \x + \xo 1:39: \xt Mat 4:23; 9:35.\x*Then he went preaching¦22665 in all their¦22673 meeting¦22671 halls¦22671 in Galilee¦22677 and driving¦22681 out demons¦22680.
\s1 Yeshua heals a man with leprosy
\rem /s1 Jesus Cleanses a Leper; A Man With Leprosy
\r (Mat. 8:1-4; Luke 5:12-16)
\p
\v 40 A man with leprosy came to Yeshua asking him, “I know that you could heal me if you wanted to.”
\p
\v 41 Yeshua felt compassion¦22709 for him, reached out his¦22714 hand¦22713 and touched¦22715 him, and said, “\wj Yes, I will. Get well.\wj*”
\v 42 Then immediately¦22727 the leprosy¦22735 disappeared and he was well again.
\v 43 So Yeshua sent¦22744 him away, but warned him:
\v 44 \x + \xo 1:44: \xt Lev 14:1-32.\x*“\wj Don't talk to anyone—just go to the priest¦22762 and show him¦22749 that you're well, and as a testimony¦22777 of that, make the offering¦22764 that Moses commanded¦22774.\wj*”
\p
\v 45 But after the man left, he started telling lots of people and spreading¦22787 the news—so much so that Yeshua could no longer¦22791 come into the town but had to stay out in quieter places¦22807, and people kept coming¦22810 to him.

\s1 Yeshua heals a paralysed man
\rem /s1 Jesus Heals a Paralytic
\r (Mat. 9:1-8; Luke 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 When Yeshua came back to Capernaum¦22822 after a few days¦22824, people soon heard¦22826 that he was back in the house¦22830.
\v 2 And so many people turned up there that there wasn't any room left—not even in the doorway. Inside, Yeshua was explaining the Scriptures to them.
\v 3 Four¦22868 men arrived, carrying¦22865 a paralysed¦22863 man to Yeshua,
\v 4 but because¦22876 of the crowd¦22880, they were unable to get close. So they climbed up onto the flat roof¦22884, made a hole through it¦22890, and lowered¦22891 the paralysed¦22902 man lying¦22903 on a pallet¦22893.
\v 5 Yeshua, observing their¦22912 faith¦22911, said to the man, “\wj Son, your¦22922 sins are forgiven¦22919!\wj*”\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Yeshua's hearers would have taken this as a claim to be God, as they knew that only God could forgive sins.\f*
\p
\v 6 But some of the religious¦22931 teachers¦22931 were sitting¦22933 there¦22932, thinking¦22935 to themselves¦22938,
\v 7 “Why's he talking¦22945 like that? He's seriously insulting¦22947 God. There's only one who can forgive¦22950 sins¦22953, and that's God himself.”
\p
\v 8 Then \nd Yeshua¦22964\nd*, knowing¦22962 in his¦22968 spirit¦22967 that they are thinking like that, said to them, “\wj Why are you thinking that to yourselves¦22986?\wj*
\v 9 \wj Which¦22988 is easier¦22991: to tell the paralysed¦22994 man that his sins¦23001 have been forgiven¦22997, or to tell him to pick up his bedding¦23011 and walk¦23015?\wj*
\v 10 \wj But so you all can see that humanity's child \em does\em* have authority¦23032 here on the earth¦23043 to forgive¦23044 sins¦23045,\wj*” he turned and said to the paralysed¦23048 man¦23038,
\v 11 “\wj Listen. Get up, take¦23055 your¦23059 bedding¦23057, and¦23060 go home¦23064!\wj*”
\p
\v 12 So the man stood up, and picked up his bedding¦23080, and went out of the house where everyone saw¦23104 him and marvelled¦23088 and praised¦23094 \nd God¦23096\nd* saying¦23098, “We've¦23104 never¦23103 seen anything happen like this before¦23083!”

\r (Mat. 9:9-13; Luke 5:27-32)
\p
\v 13 Yeshua went out beside¦23115 the lake¦23118 where crowds¦23122 of people kept coming¦23123 to him and he taught¦23128 them.
\v 14 And as he was passing¦23131 by the tax¦23143 office¦23143, he saw¦23132 Levi Alphaeus sitting¦23139 there and said to him, “Come along with me.” So Levi stood up and followed¦23152 Yeshua.
\p
\v 15 Yeshua ended up having a meal at Levi's place, and many other tax¦23171 collectors¦23171 and undesirables¦23173 were sitting¦23160 there also, along with \nd Yeshua's¦23177\nd* followers, because¦23183 by then many were following¦23187 him around.
\v 16 And the teachers¦23192 from the Pharisee¦23197 party¦23197 noticed that Yeshua was eating beside undesirables¦23210 and tax-collectors. So they asked his¦23219 followers, “How come he eats with tax-collectors and other low-life?”
\p
\v 17 And overhearing them, \nd Yeshua¦23241\nd* said, “\wj Healthy people don't¦23245 need a doctor¦23250—it's the sick¦23253 ones that do. I didn't come here to help those who think they have no needs, but to call sinners¦23262.\wj*”
\s1 The question of fasting
\rem /s1 Jesus Questioned About Fasting; A Discussion about Fasting
\r (Mat. 9:14-17; Luke 5:33-39)
\p
\v 18 Now the followers of Yohan-the-Immerser and members of the Pharisees regularly fasted. So a small group came to Yeshua and asked, “How come Yohan's followers and the Pharisee¦23275 party fast regularly, yet your followers don't¦23298?”
\p
\v 19 And \nd Yeshua¦23304\nd* answered, “\wj Can the friends of the groom fast when they're celebrating along with him? No, as long as he's still there, they won't be fasting.\wj*
\v 20 \wj But in the future, the groom will be taken¦23338 away from them, and¦23343 \em then\em* they'll be fasting¦23345.\wj*
\p
\v 21 “\wj No one sews a patch of new, unshrunken¦23359 cloth¦23358 onto an old garment¦23364, because the new patch will tear away from that old fabric and it¦23376 will end up as a worse¦23385 tear.\wj*
\v 22 \wj And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, because the wine will burst¦23408 the \add already stretched\add* wineskins, and then both the wine and the wineskins will be destroyed¦23422. New wine must be put into \em new\em* wineskins.\wj*”

\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Deu 23:25.\x*And it so happened that Yeshua and his¦23457 followers passed through some fields of grain on some days¦23443 of rest. As they went through, they plucked¦23462 off some heads¦23465 of grain.
\v 24 And some members of the Pharisee¦23469 party¦23469 said, “It's breaking the law to harvest grain on a rest day!”
\p
\v 25 And Yeshua replied, “\wj You've read yourselves what David¦23501 did when him¦23512 and his men were hungry.\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 2:26: \xt Lev 24:9.\x*\wj They went into God's tent and ate¦23533 the holy bread¦23529 representing the presence¦23531 of God. Only the priests¦23551 were allowed to eat¦23545 that, and yet David even gave¦23553 some to his men!\wj*”
\v 27 And he told the Pharisees, “\wj The days of rest were created for people, not people for the rest days.\wj*
\v 28 \wj So I, humanity's child, have authority also over the day¦23589 of rest.\wj*”

\r (Mat. 12:9-14; Luke 6:6-11)
\p
\v 1 And again¦23594 another time, Yeshua went to the meeting¦23597 hall¦23597 and there was a man¦23603 there with a curled-up hand¦23611.
\v 2 The religious leaders there were watching¦23613 him closely¦23613 to see if he would heal the man on the rest day, and then if he did, they would have a case against¦23627 him.
\v 3 Then Yeshua said to the man¦23631 with the flawed hand¦23637, “\wj Stand up there in the middle.\wj*”
\v 4 And he asked the leaders, “\wj Is it allowable to do good¦23665 on the rest day, or only to do evil¦23669? To save¦23672 life¦23671, or to kill¦23676?\wj*” But they didn't reply.
\p
\v 5 After angrily looking around¦23681 at them, grieving¦23686 at their¦23693 complete lack of compassion, he said to the man, “\wj Open up your¦23700 hand!\wj*”
\v 6 The man stretched out his fingers, and his hand became totally normal. But the Pharisees quickly left, and meeting with King Herod's¦23724 supporters¦23724, they conspired to kill¦23735 Yeshua.

\rem /s1 A Multitude at the Seaside; Crowds Follow Jesus; A Crowd by the Lake
\p
\v 7 After that, \nd Yeshua¦23739\nd* withdrew¦23745 towards the lake¦23749 with his¦23744 followers¦23758, and a huge crowd¦23753 of people¦23753 from the regions of both Galilee¦23757 and down in Yudea¦23764,
\v 8 along with others from Yerusalem¦23768, Idumea¦23772, from across the Yordan¦23777 River, and from up near Tyre¦23781 and Tsidon. They came¦23796 because they had heard about the amazing things he had done.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9-10: \xt Mrk 4:1; Luk 5:1-3.\x*So Yeshua asked his¦23804 apprentices¦23803 to organise a small¦23806 boat¦23806 to be there for him so he wouldn't be cramped by the press of the crowd¦23812.
\v 10 Virtually anyone who had any physical issues was pressing¦23823 towards him to touch¦23830 him, because he¦23820 had already healed¦23820 so many.
\v 11 And the demons¦23841, whenever¦23842 they saw Yeshua, they fell down to the ground in front of him and yelled out, “You are God's son!”
\v 12 But he regularly warned them not to reveal who he was.

\r (Mat. 10:1-4; Luke 6:12-16)
\p
\v 13 As Yeshua started climbing up a hill, he called the followers that he had selected, and they went¦23897 off with him.
\v 14 He appointed twelve¦23904 of them as his representatives so that they¦23912 could stick with him¦23915 and¦23920 be sent off to be proclaiming¦23925 his message
\v 15 and¦23928 to also have authority¦23932 to exorcise demons¦23939.
\p
\v 16 These are the twelve¦23948 that he appointed: Simon¦23953 (but he appended the name¦23951 “Peter”),
\v 17 Yacob¦23969 and his brother¦23966 Yohan¦23964 who were Zebedee's¦23961 sons (and he nicknamed them the “sons of thunder¦23983”),

\v 24 \wj If a kingdom is divided¦24132 against¦24130 itself¦24131, that kingdom could never prosper.\wj*

\v 2 And he taught¦24457 them many different things in parables¦24461, including this one:
\v 3 “\wj Listen¦24474. Once there was a farmer who went to spread some seed.\wj*
\v 4 \wj As he spread it, some landed on the path, and the birds¦24498 came and feed on it.\wj*

\v 14 \wj The one spreading seed is spreading the good message¦24728.\wj*
\v 15 \wj And there are some along¦24735 the path where¦24739 the good message is being¦24740 spread, who hear, but Satan¦24752 turns up immediately¦24748 and snatches the message from them.\wj*

\p
\v 1 So they¦25375 got \add safely\add* to the region¦25388 of Gerasenes¦25390 on the other side of the lake¦25383.
\v 2 As Yeshua climbed out of the boat¦25402, a demon-possessed¦25415 man¦25412 came out of the tombs¦25411 to meet him.
\v 3 He lived in those tombs¦25424, and¦25425 no one could tie him¦25436 up, not even with chains¦25428,
\v 4 because¦25440 he had often¦25443 been tied up in the past with shackles and chains but had always pulled the chains apart¦25456 and smashed the shackles, and no one was able to subdue him.
\v 5 All through¦25482 the day¦25487 and night¦25484, whether in the tombs¦25492 or up in the hills, he was yelling out and hurting himself¦25505 with stones¦25507.
\p
\v 6 So when he had seen¦25509 \nd Yeshua¦25512\nd* in the distance, he ran¦25515 and \add as a sign of honour\add* fell to the ground in front of him.
\v 7 Then he called out very loudly¦25524, “What will happen between us, \nd Yeshua¦25532\nd*, the son of the highest¦25537 God? I beg you in God's name not to torment¦25545 me.”
\v 8 Because Yeshua had already started saying¦25547, “\wj Come out of the man¦25561 you ungodly spirit¦25554!\wj*”
\p
\v 9 Yeshua asked, “\wj What's¦25566 your¦25569 name?\wj*”
\p The man answered, “My name is ‘Thousands’ because¦25584 there's many of us,”
\v 10 and he begged Yeshua not to send¦25597 them out of the country¦25602.
\p
\v 11 It just so happened that there¦25605 was a large herd of pigs being¦25617 fed on the hill nearby
\v 12 and¦25622 they¦25623 begged Yeshua again saying¦25633, “Send us to the pigs so that we¦25644 can enter them.”
\v 13 Yeshua agreed to that, so the ungodly spirits¦25661 came out of the man, went into the pigs, and the entire herd of some two thousand¦25683 pigs rushed¦25671 down the steep¦25676 bank into the sea and were drowned¦25685.
\p
\v 14 The ones who had been feeding¦25692 them rushed off and spread the news around in the city¦25705 and the surrounding area. So the people hurried out to see¦25713 what had happened.
\v 15 When they arrived where \nd Yeshua¦25723\nd* was, they saw the man who had been demon-possessed¦25729 fully-clothed and sitting¦25730 there in full control of his senses. They knew it was the man called ‘Thousands’ and they became frightened.
\v 16 Those who had seen¦25747 it all happen described¦25743 it all to the people—what had happened both to the demon-possessed¦25753 man and to the pigs.
\p
\v 17 So then the people began¦25759 asking Yeshua to go¦25764 away from their¦25769 region¦25768.
\p
\v 18 As Yeshua was climbing back into the boat¦25776, the man who had been demon-possessed¦25782 wanted to go with him.
\p
\v 19 But Yeshua wouldn't let him and told him to head back home¦25804 to his own people¦25808, and explain to them what the \nd Master¦25818\nd* had done for him and how he had been merciful to him.
\p
\v 20 So he went¦25829 away and shared with the people of the Ten Cities region what \nd Yeshua¦25842\nd* had done for him, and they were all amazed¦25845.

\p
\v 31 But his¦26070 followers said, “You can see all the people that were pressing¦26076 on you so why would you ask who touched¦26083 you?”
\p
\v 32 But Yeshua was still looking¦26085 around¦26085 to see¦26086 who had done it.
\v 33 And the woman¦26094, scared and shaking because of what was happening, came¦26107 and fell down in front of Yeshua and told him the whole story.
\v 34 Yeshua said¦26126, “\wj Daughter¦26129, your¦26133 faith¦26132 has healed¦26134 you. Go in peace¦26138 and full health¦26141.\wj*”
\p
\v 35 While he was still¦26161 speaking¦26148, messengers came from Jairus' house to tell him, “Your¦26158 daughter¦26157 has died¦26159. Why bother the teacher¦26164 any more?”
\p
\v 36 But \nd Yeshua¦26167\nd* overheard¦26169 them telling this to the leader¦26178 and told him, “\wj Don't be afraid—keep believing¦26182.\wj*”

\v 38 As they¦26211 approached Jairus' house¦26216, Yeshua saw a big commotion¦26223 with lots of crying and yelling going on.
\v 39 As he entered, he said, “\wj Why are you all crying in distress¦26237? The child¦26242 hasn't died¦26244—she's just sleeping¦26246!\wj*”

\v 40 But they just ridiculed¦26250 Yeshua. So he sent them all outside, just taking¦26264 the father¦26266 and mother¦26274 of the child, along with three with him. He went in where¦26285 the girl was

\v 42 Immediately she got up and walked around. And everyone marvelled¦26331 at the amazing thing that had happened. (She was twelve¦26329 years¦26328 old.)

\v 23 And he made an oath, “Even if you asked for half of my¦26932 kingdom¦26931, I'd give it to you!”
\p
\v 24 So she went out and asked her mother what she should ask for. Her¦26940 mother told her that she should ask for Yohan's head.
\p
\v 25 So going back into the party, she¦26965 said seriously to the king¦26964, “I would like the head of Yohan-the-Immerser on a plate!”
\p
\v 26 The king¦26989 was really upset with that, but because¦26992 he had made loud oaths¦26994 in front of all his guests, he couldn't say no.

\v 28 and brought¦27032 the head into the party on a plate and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her¦27051 mother¦27050.
\v 29 When Yohan's followers heard¦27053 about this, they came¦27058 and fetched his¦27057 body and put it into a tomb¦27072.

\v 30 Now the apprentices who had been sent out returned back to \nd Yeshua¦27079\nd* and they reported¦27081 back everything they had done and what they had been teaching \add people\add*.
\v 31 Then he told them, “\wj Let's just all of us head for a quiet¦27106 place¦27107 and take a break.\wj*” This was because there were so many people always coming¦27117 and going¦27120, and sometimes they didn't even have a chance to eat¦27124.
\v 32 So they¦27131 went¦27131 by boat¦27136 away to a quiet¦27140 place¦27141 by themselves¦27145.
\p
\v 33 But people from towns all around had seen them going¦27151 and recognised¦27157 who they were, so they ran¦27169 around the lake on foot¦27162 and got there¦27170 ahead¦27172 of them.

\v 35 Then, when it was already getting late, his¦27224 apprentices¦27223 came up and said, “This place¦27233 is pretty isolated and it's already late.
\v 36 Send these people off now so they can go to the nearby settlements and villages¦27251 and buy themselves¦27254 something¦27257 to eat¦27259.”
\p
\v 37 But Yeshua answered¦27266 them, “\wj You give them something to eat.\wj*”
\p They complained, “If we go, should we buy several months wages worth of bread so we can give all of them something to eat?”
\p
\v 38 But he¦27298 asked, “\wj Go and find out how much bread you¦27307 have.\wj*”
\p When they'd found out they said, “Five buns and two¦27320 fish.”
\p
\v 39 Yeshua told all the people to line up in rows and sit¦27327 down on the green¦27338 grass¦27339.
\v 40 So they sat¦27342 down in rows of fifty¦27352 to a hundred¦27348.

\v 59 But even then, they couldn't get their¦35875 accusations to align with each other.
\p
\v 60 Nevertheless the chief¦35879 priest¦35879 in the middle of the council stood¦35877 up and asked¦35883 \nd Yeshua¦35885\nd*, “Aren't you going to defend yourself? These men¦35892 are accusing you of these¦35892 things.”
\p
\v 61 But Yeshua didn't say anything. So the chief¦35911 priest¦35911 asked again, “Is it true that you're the \nd chosen¦35925\nd* one that God promised to send—the son of the blessed¦35931 \add God\add*?”
\p
\v 62 \x + \xo 14:62: \xt Dan 7:13.\x*\nd Yeshua¦35935\nd* replied, “I am. And you¦35943 will all see humanity's child sitting¦35951 in the honoured position by the powerful¦35953 God and¦35954 coming¦35955 through the clouds¦35959 in the sky¦35962.”

\p Even the other two being executed¦36777 with him were deriding¦36780 him.

\v 33 At noon, it got dark everywhere, until¦36796 3pm,
\v 34 \x + \xo 15:34: \xt Psa 22:1.\x*when \nd Yeshua¦36808\nd* shouted¦36806 loudly¦36810, “\wj My¦36825 God, my¦36825 God, why have you¦36832 abandoned¦36832 me?\wj*”
\p
\v 35 Some of the people standing nearby thought he was calling¦36848 the prophet Eliyah.
\v 36 \x + \xo 15:36: \xt Psa 69:21.\x*One of them ran, and soaked a sponge¦36858 in some sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Yeshua to drink¦36864, saying¦36866, “Hang on. Let's see¦36870 if Eliyah does come to get him down.”
\p
\v 37 But just then \nd Yeshua¦36878\nd* uttered a loud¦36881 cry¦36880 and exhaled his last breath.

\v 39 The Roman centurion¦36900 who had been standing back watching everything, said¦36916 when Yeshua died, “This man¦36920 was definitely God's son.”
\p
\v 40 \x + \xo 15:40-41: \xt Luk 8:2-3.\x*Further back, there was also a group of women¦36931 observing¦36934 everything. These included Maria from Magdala¦36942, Maria the mother¦36954 of young Yacob¦36947 and Joses, and Salome,
\v 41 and others who had followed¦36964 Yeshua around Galilee¦36963 and helped look after¦36966 him, along with many others who had come¦36976 down with him to Yerusalem¦36979.
\s1 Yosef boldly lays the body in a burial chamber

\r (Jn 19:38-42; Mat. 27:57-61; Luke 23:50-56)
\p
\v 42 As evening¦36982 came, it was now the Preparation Day, i.e., the day before the Rest Day.
\v 43 Yosef (who'd come¦36995 from the city of Arimathea¦37000 and one who was waiting¦37009 for the coming of God's kingdom¦37011), a prominent¦37002 council¦37003 member¦37003, steeled himself¦37007 up and went in to see the governor to get permission to transfer \nd Yeshua's¦37026\nd* body¦37024.
\v 44 Governor Pilate¦37029 didn't think he'd be dead yet, so he called¦37038 an army commander to find out if Yeshua had indeed died.
\v 45 As soon as he found out, he gave Yosef permission.
\v 46 So Yosef \add and his companions\add* went and bought¦37068 some linen burial cloth and then, removing Yeshua's body from the pole, wrapped¦37076 it in the cloth and placed it in a burial chamber that had been chiseled into a rockface. Then they rolled¦37099 a rock¦37097 across the opening.
\v 47 Others were watching and noted where¦37128 the body had been laid, including Maria from Magdala¦37114 and Maria the mother¦37117 of Joses.

\rem /s1 The Resurrection of Jesus
\r (Jn 20:1-10; Mat. 28:1-8; Luke 24:1-12)
\p
\v 1 After the Rest Day was over, Maria from Magdala¦37139 and Maria the mother¦37142 of Yacob¦37144 and Salome, went and bought¦37148 some traditional burial spices¦37149 that evening to take to the burial chamber and place with the body.
\v 2 Then very early¦37159 on Sunday morning they¦37167 went to the chamber, arriving just as the sun¦37176 was rising.
\v 3 But they realised that they didn't have anyone with them to roll the rock away that was covering the entrance.
\v 4 However, when they looked¦37199 they saw that the very large¦37211 rock had already been rolled¦37203 away.
\v 5 So they went on into the burial chamber and were totally stunned to find a young¦37229 man¦37229 dressed in white¦37237, sitting¦37231 in there on the side.
\p
\v 6 He assured them, “Don't be surprised. I know you're looking¦37257 for¦37257 \nd Yeshua¦37256\nd* from Nazareth¦37259, the one who was executed¦37262 on a pole. But see¦37267 there where¦37275 his body was—he's not there because he came back to life.
\v 7 \x + \xo 16:7: \xt Mat 26:32; Mrk 14:28.\x*So you three should go and tell his¦37284 trainees, and Peter in particular, that he's going to go up ahead of them to Galilee¦37295 and you'll all see him up there¦37296, just as he already told you.”
\p
\v 8 So they left the chamber and took off running, still stunned and shaking and too scared to stop and to talk to anyone.
