\mt2 The account of Yeshua's ministry by
\mt1 Mark
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua was written by Mark, the son of a Jewish family who lived in Yerushalem. His mother was named Maria (Acts 12:12).
\ip Many people think he was Yohan Mark, a cousin of Barnabas (Col. 4:10) who accompanied Paul on his first long-distance trip to spread the good message about Yeshua the messiah (Acts 12:25, 13:13). We also know that Mark accompanied Peter (1 Peter 5:13), and some consider that it might have been Peter who narrated to Mark what Yeshua had done and taught.
\is2 This account
\ip This account seems to have been written for non-Jews, especially perhaps those familiar with Roman customs. So he didn't use as much ink as Matthew or Luke explaining prophecies from the Jewish scriptures but he does however, take time to explain Jewish customs to help non-Jewish readers.
\ip Mark explains here that Yeshua came to serve both God and the people, and he often refers to him as ‘humanity's child’ (traditionally translated very literally from the Greek as the ‘Son of Man’). We can see that especially in 10:45: “Even humanity's child didn't come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom to set many people free.” Mark wants his readers to know that Yeshua did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Yeshua by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons.
\ip The ending of this account is often disputed, and scholars are still \jmp debating|link-href="https://textandcanon.org/a-case-for-the-longer-ending-of-mark"\jmp* about whether or not the longer ending (16:9-20) is original. The \em OET\em* includes the disputed longer ending, but displays it in a lighter colour to indicate its debatable status.

\v 5 And many from the Yudean region¦21719 and from the city of Yerushalem went out to hear him, and they confessed¦21735 their¦21738 sins¦21737 and asked Yohan to immerse¦21725 them in the Yordan¦21731 river¦21732.

\rem /s1 Jesus Calls the First Disciples
\p
\v 16 As he went around the lake of Galilee¦21976, Yeshua saw¦21977 two fishermen¦21998, Simon¦21979 and¦21968 his brother¦21983 Andrew¦21981 throwing¦21987 a net¦21987 into the lake.
\v 17 And he said¦22000 to them, “\wj Come with me and¦22007 I will make you¦22009 into fishermen¦22011 of people¦22012.\wj*”
\v 18 And so they¦22020 left their¦22017 fishing work and¦22013 went off with Yeshua.
\p
\v 19 Then¦22023 a bit further on he saw¦22028 two of Zebedee's¦22032 sons, Yacob and¦22023 his¦22037 brother¦22036 Yohan, in a boat¦22042 getting their nets¦22045 ready.
\v 20 Yeshua called¦22048 them and¦22046 they¦22067 too went¦22067 off with him¦22070, leaving their¦22055 father¦22054 Zebedee¦22056 in the boat¦22060 with the hired¦22063 workers.

\rem /s1 The Man with an Unclean Spirit; Jesus Casts Out an Evil Spirit; A Man with an Evil Spirit; Jesus Drives Out an Evil Spirit

\p
\v 21 They went on into Capernaum¦22076 where he went into the meeting¦22088 hall¦22088 and¦22072 began teaching¦22089 as soon as the rest day started.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Mat 7:28-29.\x*The congregation was amazed¦22092 at his¦22096 teaching, because¦22098 he taught¦22095 with authority¦22102, not like the regular teachers¦22108 there.
\p
\v 23 Then¦22110 a demon-possessed man¦22118 in the meeting¦22115 hall¦22115 suddenly yelled¦22124 out,
\v 24 “What are we to you, \nd Yeshua\nd* of \nd Nazareth¦22133\nd*? You've come to destroy¦22136 us. I know that you're¦22141 God's holy one.”
\p
\v 25 But¦22148 \nd Yeshua\nd* scolded it, saying¦22154, “\wj Keep quiet¦22156!\wj*”, and¦22148, “\wj Come out of him!\wj*”
\p
\v 26 Then¦22165 the demon¦22172 threw the man into a convulsion¦22167, cried out loudly¦22182, and¦22165 left¦22185 him.
\v 27 Everyone was astounded¦22190 and asked each other, “What just happened? We haven't heard anything like this before—he has authority¦22218 to command¦22229 demons¦22228, and they obey¦22231 him!”
\p
\v 28 And the news¦22237 about Yeshua spread all over the entire¦22242 region¦22244 of Galilee¦22247.
\s1 Yeshua heals many others
\rem /s1 Jesus Heals Many at Simon's House
\r (Mat. 8:14-17; Luke 4:38-41)
\p
\v 29 After leaving the meeting¦22254 hall¦22254, Yeshua went¦22258 into the home of Simon¦22262 and Andrew¦22264, along with Yacob and Yohan.
\v 30 Inside, Simon's mother-in-law was lying¦22277 down with a fever¦22278, and¦22273 the others spoke to Yeshua about¦22283 her.
\v 31 When he went up to her, and took hold of her hand¦22293 and helped her up, the fever¦22306 left her and she prepared something for them to eat.
\p
\v 32 That evening¦22312 when the sun¦22318 set, the people brought all those who were sick¦22324 or demon-possessed to Yeshua.
\v 33 It seemed like the entire¦22333 town had gathered¦22337 there outside the front door¦22343.
\v 34 Yeshua healed¦22367 many who were sick¦22369 from a range¦22371 of diseases¦22372, and¦22366 he commanded many demons to leave—not allowing¦22382 them to speak¦22386 because¦22387 they knew that he was the \nd messiah¦22391\nd*.
\s1 Yeshua prays before going preaching
\rem /s1 Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place; Jesus Preaches in Galilee; A Preaching Tour in Galilee
\r (Luke 4:42-44)
\p
\v 35 In the small hours of the morning, Yeshua got¦22398 up¦22398 and went¦22401 out to a quiet¦22404 place¦22405 and prayed¦22409 there¦22406.
\v 36 But¦22411 Simon¦22418 and¦22411 the others came looking¦22413 for him,
\v 37 and when they found¦22425 him they said, “Everyone's looking¦22434 for¦22434 you!”
\p
\v 38 And Yeshua answered, “\wj Well, we'll be going¦22442 into the other villages¦22450 around here, so that I can also tell them. That's what I came¦22467 here for.\wj*”
\v 39 \x + \xo 1:39: \xt Mat 4:23; 9:35.\x*Then¦22469 he went¦22470 preaching¦22472 in all their¦22480 meeting¦22478 halls¦22478 in Galilee¦22484 and¦22469 driving¦22488 out demons¦22487.
\s1 Yeshua heals a man with leprosy
\rem /s1 Jesus Cleanses a Leper; A Man With Leprosy

\p
\v 40 A man with leprosy came to Yeshua asking him, “I know that you could heal me if you wanted to.”
\p
\v 41 Yeshua felt compassion¦22516 for him, reached out his¦22521 hand¦22520 and touched¦22522 him, and said, “\wj Yes, I will. Get well.\wj*”
\v 42 Then¦22530 immediately¦22533 the leprosy¦22541 disappeared and¦22530 he was well again.
\v 43 So¦22544 Yeshua sent¦22549 him away, but warned him:
\v 44 \x + \xo 1:44: \xt Lev 14:1-32.\x*“\wj Don't talk to anyone¦22556—just go to the priest¦22566 and show him¦22554 that you're well, and as a testimony¦22581 of that, make the offering¦22568 that Mosheh commanded¦22578.\wj*”
\p
\v 45 But after the man left, he started telling lots of people and spreading¦22591 the news—so much so that Yeshua could no longer¦22595 come into the town but¦22585 had to stay out in quieter places¦22611, and people kept coming¦22614 to him.

\s1 Yeshua heals a paralysed man
\rem /s1 Jesus Heals a Paralytic
\r (Mat. 9:1-8; Luke 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 When Yeshua came back to Capernaum¦22626 after a few days¦22628, people soon heard¦22630 that he was back in the house¦22634.
\v 2 And so many people turned up there that¦22645 there wasn't any room¦22643 left—not even in the doorway. Inside, Yeshua was explaining the Scriptures to them.
\v 3 Four¦22672 men arrived, carrying¦22669 a paralysed¦22667 man to Yeshua,
\v 4 but because¦22680 of the crowd¦22684, they were unable to get close. So¦22673 they climbed up onto the flat roof¦22688, made a hole through it¦22694, and¦22673 lowered¦22695 the paralysed¦22705 man lying¦22706 on a pallet¦22697.
\v 5 Yeshua, observing their¦22715 faith¦22714, said to the man, “\wj Son, your¦22725 sins are forgiven¦22722!\wj*”\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Yeshua's hearers would have taken this as a claim to be God, as they knew that only God could forgive sins.\f*
\p
\v 6 But some of the religious¦22734 teachers¦22734 were sitting¦22736 there¦22735, thinking¦22738 to themselves¦22741,
\v 7 “Why's he talking¦22748 like that? He's seriously insulting¦22750 God. There's only one who can forgive¦22753 sins¦22756, and that's God himself.”
\p
\v 8 Then¦22762 \nd Yeshua\nd*, knowing¦22764 in his¦22770 spirit¦22769 that they are thinking like that, said to them, “\wj Why are you thinking that to yourselves¦22788?\wj*
\v 9 \wj Which¦22790 is easier¦22793: to tell the paralysed¦22796 man that his sins¦22803 have been forgiven¦22799, or to tell him to pick up his bedding¦22813 and walk¦22816?\wj*
\v 10 \wj But so you all can see that humanity's child \+em does\+em* have authority¦22833 here on the earth¦22844 to forgive¦22845 sins¦22846,\wj*” he turned and said to the paralysed¦22849 man¦22839,
\v 11 “\wj Listen. Get up, take¦22856 your¦22859 bedding¦22858, and¦22860 go home¦22864!\wj*”
\p
\v 12 So¦22868 the man stood up, and picked up his bedding¦22879, and went¦22880 out of the house where everyone saw¦22902 him and marvelled¦22886 and praised¦22892 \nd God¦22894\nd* saying¦22896, “We've¦22902 never¦22901 seen anything like that happen before¦22881!”

\p
\v 13 Yeshua went¦22909 out beside¦22912 the lake¦22915 where crowds¦22919 of people kept coming¦22920 to him and¦22908 he taught¦22925 them.
\v 14 And as he was passing¦22928 by the tax¦22939 office¦22939, he saw¦22929 Levi Alfaeus sitting¦22935 there and said to him, “Come along with me.” So¦22927 Levi stood up and followed¦22948 Yeshua.
\p
\v 15 Yeshua ended up having a meal at Levi's place, and many other tax¦22967 collectors¦22967 and undesirables¦22969 were sitting¦22956 there also, along with \nd Yeshua's\nd* followers, because¦22979 by then¦22951, many \add people\add* were following¦22983 him around.

\p
\v 17 \nd Yeshua\nd* overheard them and¦23034 said, “\wj Healthy people don't¦23041 need a doctor¦23046—it's the sick¦23049 ones that do. I didn't¦23041 come here to help those who think they have no needs, but \add ≡I came¦23053\add* to call sinners¦23058.\wj*”

\p
\v 18 Now the followers of Yohan-the-immerser and members of the Pharisees regularly fasted. So¦23061 a small group came to Yeshua and asked, “How come Yohan's followers and the Pharisee party fast regularly, yet your followers don't¦23094?”
\p
\v 19 And \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj Can the friends of the groom fast when they're celebrating along with him? No, as long¦23116 as he's still there, they won't¦23101 be fasting.\wj*
\v 20 \wj But in the future, the groom will be taken¦23134 away from them, and¦23139 \+em then\+em* they'll be fasting¦23141.\wj*

\v 24 And some members of the Pharisee party¦23265 said, “It's breaking the law to harvest grain on a rest day!”
\p
\v 25 And Yeshua replied, “\wj You've read yourselves what David¦23297 did when him¦23308 and¦23283 his men were hungry.\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 2:26: \xt Lev 24:9.\x*\wj They went¦23311 into God's tent and ate¦23329 the holy bread¦23325 representing the presence¦23327 of God. Only the priests¦23347 were allowed to eat¦23341 that¦23337, and yet David even gave¦23349 some to his men!\wj*”

\v 2 The religious leaders there were watching¦23409 him closely¦23409 to see if he would heal the man on the rest day, and¦23408 then¦23408 if he did, they would have a case against¦23423 him.
\v 3 Then¦23424 Yeshua said to the man¦23427 with the flawed hand¦23433, “\wj Stand up there in the middle.\wj*”
\v 4 And he asked the leaders, “\wj Is it allowable to do good¦23460 on the rest day, or only to do evil¦23464? To save¦23467 life¦23466, or to kill¦23471?\wj*” But¦23449 they didn't reply.
\p
\v 5 After angrily looking around¦23476 at them, grieving¦23481 at their¦23488 complete lack of compassion, he said to the man, “\wj Open up your¦23495 hand!\wj*”
\v 6 The man stretched out his fingers, and his hand became totally normal. But¦23509 the Pharisees quickly left, and meeting with King Herod's supporters¦23517, they conspired to kill¦23528 Yeshua.

\v 8 along with others from Yerushalem, Idumea¦23565, from across the Yordan¦23570 River, and from up near Tyre¦23574 and Tsidon. They came¦23589 because they had heard about the amazing things he had done.

\v 10 Virtually anyone who had any physical issues was pressing¦23615 towards him to touch¦23622 him, because¦23611 he¦23612 had already healed¦23612 so many.
\v 11 And the demons¦23633, whenever¦23634 they saw Yeshua, they fell down to the ground in front of him and¦23628 yelled out, “You are God's son!”

\v 20 Then¦23826 Yeshua was approaching a house¦23831, but the crowd¦23836 swarmed them again¦23834 so they had no opportunity to eat¦23845.
\v 21 The ones with him heard¦23848 all the noise and¦23846 came¦23859 to get him, because they were wondering if he was crazy.
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Mat 9:34; 10:25.\x*The religious¦23872 teachers¦23872 had come¦23876 up from Yerushalem and¦23870 were complaining, “He's possessed by the prince of demons. He can command them because he rules them!”
\p
\v 23 But¦23897 Yeshua addressed them: “\wj How could Satan¦23911 command himself?\wj*
\v 24 \wj If a kingdom is divided¦23920 against¦23918 itself¦23919, that kingdom could never prosper.\wj*
\v 25 \wj If a household is divided¦23933 against¦23931 itself¦23932, that family will never prosper.\wj*

\v 2 \add ≈From there\add*, he taught¦24246 them many different things in parables¦24250, including this one:
\v 3 “\wj Listen¦24263. Once there was a farmer who went¦24264 to spread some seed.\wj*
\v 4 \wj As he spread it, some landed on the path¦24281, and the birds¦24287 came and fed on it.\wj*
\v 5 \wj Some landed on a rocky¦24302 part without a lot of soil, and¦24293 it¦24308 quickly sprouted in the warm, shallow soil,\wj*
\v 6 \wj but when the sun¦24332 came up, it dried out because¦24336 the roots weren't deep, and so it just withered¦24341 up.\wj*
\v 7 \wj Some of the seed landed in a thistle patch, and the thistles grew and choked¦24357 it out, so the plants never bore a crop.\wj*
\v 8 \wj But¦24365 some seed landed in fertile soil and it bore a harvest—some of it multiplying thirty¦24391 times, some sixty¦24397, and some a hundred¦24403 times.\wj*”

\rem /s1 Jesus Explains the Parable of the Sower
\r (Mat. 13:18-23; Luke 8:11-15)
\p
\v 13 Then¦24496 Yeshua said to them, “\wj If you didn't¦24499 understand this parable¦24502, how will you understand any others?\wj*
\v 14 \wj The person spreading seed is spreading the good message¦24515,\wj*
\v 15 \wj and there are some along¦24522 the path¦24524 where¦24526 the good message is being¦24527 spread, who hear, but Satan¦24538 turns up immediately¦24535 and snatches the message from them.\wj*
\v 16 \wj Similarly, there's some seed that falls onto rocky¦24566 places¦24566 where the people who hear¦24572 the good message¦24574 happily accept it¦24579,\wj*
\v 17 \wj but don't¦24581 make strong roots—just temporary¦24587 \+add changes\+add*. So when they get mocked or attacked about accepting the good message¦24597, they quickly stumble¦24600.\wj*
\v 18 \wj Others are the ones where the seed was spread among¦24609 the thistles. They heard¦24621 the good message¦24619,\wj*
\v 19 \wj but contemporary topics, or the lure of money, or the appetite for other¦24645 things, choke their good intentions and the message¦24650 becomes¦24654 unfruitful¦24652 in them.\wj*
\v 20 \wj But¦24656 lastly, the seed that landed on the good soil represents the people who hear¦24671 the good message¦24673, accept¦24675 it, and¦24656 are fruitful¦24677 thirty¦24682, sixty¦24686, or even a hundred¦24690 times over.\wj*”

\v 36 So¦25002 they left the crowd¦25007 behind and¦25002 got into the boat¦25015 with him.

\v 39 Now awake, Yeshua scolded the wind and waves, “\wj Quieten down! Stop that!\wj*” Then¦25084 the wind died down and the water became¦25105 very calm.
\v 40 And \add turning back to them\add* he¦25109 asked, “\wj Why were you all so afraid? Don't you have any faith¦25121 yet?\wj*”

\p
\v 1 So¦25150 they¦25151 got \add safely\add* to the region¦25163 of Gerasenes¦25165 on the other side of the lake¦25158.
\v 2 As Yeshua climbed out of the boat¦25177, a demon-possessed man¦25186 came out of the tombs¦25185 to meet him.
\v 3 He lived in those tombs¦25198, and¦25199 no one could tie him¦25209 up, not even with chains¦25202,
\v 4 because¦25213 he had often¦25216 been tied up in the past with shackles and chains but had always pulled the chains apart¦25229 and smashed the shackles, and no one was able to subdue him.
\v 5 All through¦25255 the day¦25260 and night¦25257, whether in the tombs¦25265 or up in the hills, he was yelling out and hurting himself¦25278 with stones¦25280.
\p
\v 6 So¦25281 when he had seen¦25282 \nd Yeshua¦25285\nd* in the distance, he ran¦25288 and¦25281 \add as a sign of honour\add* fell to the ground in front of him.
\v 7 Then he called out very loudly¦25297, “What will happen between us, \nd Yeshua\nd*, the son of the highest¦25310 God? I beg you in God's name not to torment¦25318 me.”
\v 8 Because¦25321 Yeshua had already started saying¦25320, “\wj Come out of the man¦25334 you ungodly¦25329 spirit¦25327!\wj*”
\p
\v 9 Yeshua asked, “\wj What's¦25339 your¦25342 name?\wj*”
\p The man answered, “My name is ‘Thousands’ because¦25356 there's many of us,”
\v 10 and¦25359 he begged Yeshua not to send¦25369 them out of the country¦25374.
\p
\v 11 It just so happened that there¦25377 was a large herd of pigs being¦25389 fed on the hill nearby
\v 12 and¦25394 they¦25395 begged Yeshua again saying¦25405, “Send us to the pigs so that we¦25416 can enter them.”
\v 13 Yeshua agreed to that, so the ungodly¦25435 spirits¦25433 came out of the man, went¦25436 into the pigs, and the entire herd of some two thousand¦25454 pigs rushed¦25442 down the steep¦25447 bank into the sea and were drowned¦25456.
\p
\v 14 The ones who had been feeding¦25463 them rushed off and spread the news around in the city¦25474 and the surrounding area. So¦25460 the people hurried out to see¦25482 what had happened.
\v 15 When they arrived where \nd Yeshua\nd* was, they saw the man who had been demon-possessed fully-clothed and sitting¦25499 there in full control of his senses. They knew it was the man called ‘Thousands’ and they became frightened.
\v 16 Those who had seen¦25515 it all happen described¦25511 it all to the people—what had happened both to the demon-possessed man and¦25510 to the pigs.
\p
\v 17 So¦25526 then¦25526 the people began¦25527 asking Yeshua to go¦25532 away from their¦25537 region¦25536.
\p
\v 18 As Yeshua was climbing back into the boat¦25544, the man who had been demon-possessed wanted to go with him.
\p
\v 19 But¦25559 Yeshua wouldn't let him and told him to head back home¦25572 to his own people¦25576, and explain to them what the \nd Master¦25586\nd* had done for him and how he had been merciful to him.
\p
\v 20 So¦25596 he went¦25597 away and shared with the people of the Ten Cities region what \nd Yeshua\nd* had done for him, and they were all amazed¦25613.

\v 21 When \nd Yeshua\nd* had crossed¦25615 in the boat¦25621 to the other side of the lake, a large crowd¦25631 of people came out to the lake edge to see him¦25635.
\v 22 A religious leader¦25647 named Jairus came out, and¦25641 when he found Yeshua he fell down at his¦25661 feet¦25660
\v 23 and pleaded, “My¦25673 young daughter¦25672 is critical and just hanging on for you¦25681 to come¦25678 and touch her¦25691 so that she¦25694 can be healed¦25694 and live¦25696.”
\p
\v 24 So¦25698 Yeshua went¦25700 off with Jairus. The large crowd¦25707 followed¦25704 also and¦25709 many were getting pressed¦25710 against Yeshua.
\p
\v 25 Then¦25712 a woman¦25713 came who had been losing blood¦25718 for twelve¦25720 years¦25721
\v 26 and who had endured much under¦25726 various doctors¦25728 despite spending everything she had. After all that, she'd ended up even worse¦25744,
\v 27 but when she heard¦25747 about what Yeshua had been doing, she worked her way through the crowd¦25755 to the back of Yeshua and touched¦25758 his¦25761 clothes,
\v 28 because¦25767 she¦25765 had told herself, “If I could even just touch¦25772 his¦25780 clothes, I would be healed¦25782.”
\p
\v 29 And immediately¦25784 the bleeding stopped and¦25783 she knew¦25792 that she had been healed¦25796.
\v 30 Immediately also, \nd Yeshua\nd* knew that power¦25813 had gone out of him, and he turned¦25818 back towards the crowd¦25821 and said, “\wj Who touched¦25826 my¦25825 clothes¦25828?\wj*”
\p
\v 31 But¦25830 his¦25836 followers said, “You can see all the people that were pressing¦25842 on you so why would you ask who touched¦25849 you?”
\p
\v 32 But¦25850 Yeshua was still looking¦25851 around¦25851 to see¦25852 who had done it.
\v 33 And the woman¦25860, scared and shaking because of what was happening, came¦25873 and fell down in front of Yeshua and told him the whole story.
\v 34 Yeshua said¦25892, “\wj Daughter¦25895, your¦25898 faith¦25897 has healed¦25899 you. Go in peace¦25903 and¦25890 full health¦25906.\wj*”
\p
\v 35 While he was still¦25926 speaking¦25913, messengers came from Jairus' house to tell him, “Your¦25923 daughter¦25922 has died¦25924. Why bother the teacher¦25929 any more?”
\p
\v 36 But \nd Yeshua\nd* overheard¦25934 them telling this to the leader¦25943 and told him, “\wj Don't be afraid—keep believing¦25947.\wj*”
\v 37 And Yeshua didn't¦25949 allow¦25950 anyone¦25951 to accompany¦25961 him¦25956 other than Peter¦25966, and Yacob and his brother¦25972, Yohan.
\v 38 As they¦25976 approached Jairus' house¦25981, Yeshua saw a big commotion¦25988 with lots of crying and¦25975 yelling going on.
\v 39 As he entered, he said, “\wj Why are you all crying in distress¦26002? The child¦26007 hasn't died¦26009—she's just sleeping¦26011!\wj*”
\p
\v 40 But¦26014 they just ridiculed¦26015 Yeshua. So¦26014 he sent them all outside, just taking¦26029 the father¦26031 and¦26014 mother¦26039 of the child, along with three with him. He went in where¦26050 the girl was
\v 41 and¦26056 taking her hand¦26060, he said, “\wj Young woman, I tell you: get up!\wj*”
\v 42 Immediately she got up and¦26080 walked around. And everyone marvelled¦26094 at the amazing thing that had happened. (She was twelve¦26092 years¦26091 old.)

\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 6:14-15: \xt Mat 16:14; Mrk 8:28; Luk 9:19.\x*Yeshua was now becoming well known and King Herod¦26436 \add Antipas\add* heard¦26432 about him. He thought that maybe Yohan-the-immerser had come back to life and that's why he was able to do miracles¦26462.
\p
\v 15 But others thought it was \add the promised return of\add* Eliyah, and¦26473 yet others thought he must be another prophet¦26476 like the ones \add in the Scriptures\add*.
\p
\v 16 But hearing about Yeshua, Herod¦26486 was telling people, “That Yohan who I had beheaded¦26493, he must have come back to life!”
\v 17 \x + \xo 6:17-18: \xt Luk 3:19-20.\x*Because¦26508 Herod¦26510 himself¦26506 had had Yohan arrested and put in prison¦26525 because¦26508 he had married¦26538 Herodias¦26528, his¦26534 brother¦26533 Philip's wife¦26530.
\v 18 Yohan had been telling him that it was wrong for him to marry his brother's¦26557 wife¦26554,
\v 19 and¦26560 so Herodias¦26561 resented¦26563 him enough to want to kill¦26570 him, but Herod hadn't be able to
\v 20 because¦26576 he respected Yohan as a righteous¦26584 and holy teacher and so he kept him alive. He often enjoyed hearing¦26601 from Yohan and thought a lot about what he said.
\p
\v 21 However, an opportunity¦26606 came at Herod's birthday¦26611 celebration¦26611, when he threw a feast for his¦26612 top officials and generals and for the leaders¦26624 in Galilee¦26626.
\v 22 The daughter¦26632 of Herodias¦26636 came in and danced¦26638 for them, and the king and his party guests all enjoyed it. So¦26627 the king said to the young woman, “Just ask me for anything and I'll give it to you.”
\v 23 And he made an oath, “Even if you asked for half of my¦26690 kingdom¦26689, I'd give it to you!”
\p
\v 24 So¦26693 she went out and¦26693 asked her mother what she should ask for. Her¦26698 mother told her that she should ask for Yohan's head.
\p
\v 25 So¦26713 going back into the party, she¦26722 said seriously to the king¦26721, “I would like the head of Yohan-the-immerser on a plate!”
\p
\v 26 The king¦26747 was really upset with that, but because¦26750 he had made loud oaths¦26752 in front of all his guests, he couldn't say no.
\v 27 So¦26763 he ordered an executioner¦26769 to go out and return with Yohan's head. He went off and beheaded¦26783 him in the prison¦26787
\v 28 and brought¦26789 the head into the party on a plate and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her¦26808 mother¦26807.
\v 29 When Yohan's followers heard¦26810 about this, they came¦26815 and fetched his¦26814 body and put it into a tomb¦26828.

\v 30 Now the apprentices who had been sent out returned back to \nd Yeshua\nd* and they reported¦26837 back everything they had done and what they had been teaching \add people\add*.
\v 31 Then¦26848 he told them, “\wj Let's just all of us head for a quiet¦26861 place¦26862 and take a break.\wj*” This was because¦26870 there were so many people always coming¦26872 and going¦26875, and sometimes they didn't¦26878 even have a chance to eat¦26879.
\v 32 So¦26883 they¦26885 went¦26885 by boat¦26890 away to a quiet¦26894 place¦26895 by themselves¦26899.
\p
\v 33 But¦26900 people from towns all around had seen them going¦26904 and recognised¦26910 who they were, so they ran¦26922 around the lake on foot¦26915 and got there¦26923 ahead¦26925 of them.
\v 34 \x + \xo 6:34: \xt Num 27:17; 1Ki 22:17; 2Ch 18:16; Eze 34:5; Mat 9:36.\x*So¦26933 when Yeshua got out of the boat, he saw¦26938 a big crowd¦26943 and¦26933 felt sorry for them because¦26952 they seemed like sheep¦26955 without a shepherd¦26958, so he started teaching¦26962 them many things.
\v 35 Then¦26966, when it was already getting late, his¦26977 apprentices¦26976 came up and said, “This place¦26986 is pretty isolated and it's already late.
\v 36 Send these people off now so they can go to the nearby settlements and villages¦27004 and buy themselves¦27007 something¦27010 to eat¦27012.”
\p
\v 37 But¦27029 Yeshua answered¦27019 them, “\wj You give them something to eat.\wj*”
\p They complained, “If we go, should we buy several months wages worth of bread so we can give all of them something to eat?”
\p
\v 38 But¦27052 he¦27050 asked, “\wj Go and find out how much bread you¦27059 have.\wj*”
\p When they'd found out they said, “Five buns and two¦27072 fish.”
\p
\v 39 Yeshua told all the people to line up in rows and¦27074 sit¦27079 down on the green¦27090 grass¦27091.
\v 40 So¦27092 they sat¦27093 down in rows of fifty¦27103 to a hundred¦27099.
\v 41 Then¦27104 holding the five buns and two fish, he looking up to the sky¦27116 and blessed¦27117 \add God\add*, and then¦27104 broke¦27120 up the buns and gave pieces to his¦27128 apprentices¦27127 so they could do likewise to the people, and he also divided¦27139 up the two fish,
\v 42 and all the people ate¦27142 and were satisfied¦27145.
\v 43 Then¦27146 they¦27147 collected the leftover pieces of bread, filling¦27153 twelve¦27150 baskets¦27152, as well as the leftover pieces of fish.

\v 46 Then¦27199 he said goodbye¦27200 to everyone, and¦27199 climbed the hill to pray.
\v 47 Later in the night, the boat¦27213 was out in the middle of the lake¦27219, and¦27207 only Yeshua remained back there on the land.

\v 49 But¦27270 they had seen¦27271 someone walking¦27277 on the lake¦27276 and thought it was a ghost¦27280, and they yelled¦27285 out

\v 51 Then¦27312 he climbed up into the boat¦27318 and¦27312 the wind¦27324 died¦27322 down. And they were all totally astounded

\p
\v 1 Some from the Pharisee party¦27466 and¦27467 some of the law teachers¦27470 had come¦27471 from Yerushalem to observe Yeshua
\v 2 and¦27474 noticed that some of his¦27481 followers were eating¦27490 their food without following their religious customs, i.e., without washing their hands¦27485.
\v 3 (The Pharisees and¦27499, in fact, all the Jewish religious leaders do not eat without first ceremonially washing their hands¦27509 as taught by their elders¦27519 over the generations.

\p
\v 5 And the Pharisees and¦27558 religious¦27560 teachers¦27560 asked Yeshua, “How come your¦27568 followers don't¦27569 follow our Jewish traditions¦27573, but¦27576 eat without the ceremonial washing of hands¦27582?”
\p
\v 6 And he answered¦27588, “\wj Yeshayah got it exactly right¦27592 when he expressed God's thoughts about you hypocrites¦27599 and¦27587 wrote¦27602:\wj*\x + \xo 7:6-7: \xt Isa 29:13 (LXX).\x*

\p
\v 20 He continued, “\wj It's what comes out of you that makes you guilty in God's eyes.\wj*

\v 26 The woman¦28019 was Greek¦28021 from Phoenicia¦28023 in Syria¦28023 and¦28026 she¦28027 begged Yeshua to command the demon¦28031 to leave her¦28038 daughter¦28037.

\v 46 They arrived at Jericho, and then¦31453 when Yeshua and his¦31468 followers were leaving again with a large¦31471 crowd¦31470 following, they¦31454 came across blind¦31477 Bartimayos¦31475 sitting¦31480 beside¦31481 the path¦31483 begging.
\v 47 When he heard¦31487 that it was Yeshua from \nd Nazareth¦31493\nd* going past, he yelled out, “Yeshua, \add promised\add* descendant of David¦31501, help me please.”
\p
\v 48 When several people told him to stop, he just yelled out even louder, “Yeshua, \add promised\add* descendant of David¦31522, please help me.”
\p
\v 49 Then¦31525 \nd Yeshua\nd* stopped¦31526 and got the people to call the blind¦31540 man¦31540. So¦31525 they called him, “Hey, be confident! Get up and come because he's called for you.”
\p
\v 50 So¦31551 Bartimayos threw off his¦31555 jacket, jumped¦31556 up, and¦31551 was led to \nd Yeshua\nd*.
\p
\v 51 “\wj Now, what can I do for you?\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* asked.
\p “My teacher¦31582, I'd like to be able to see,” Bartimayos replied.

\v 1 As they¦31610 got close to Yerushalem and were passing Bethphage¦31616 and Bethany¦31619 on the Mt¦31622. of Olives¦31625, Yeshua sent two¦31628 of his¦31631 apprentices¦31630 ahead, telling them,
\v 2 “\wj Go on to the next village¦31641 and as you enter¦31647 it, you'll see a young donkey that¦31642 hasn't ever been ridden yet. Untie it and bring¦31671 it back here.\wj*
\v 3 \wj If anyone¦31676 asks what you're doing¦31681, tell them that the \+nd master¦31689\+nd* needs it and¦31673 he'll return it later.\wj*”
\p
\v 4 So¦31702 they went ahead and found¦31707 a donkey tied up on the path just outside¦31716 the door¦31713 of a house, and so they went to untie it.
\v 5 But¦31723 some of the people standing around there¦31727 said, “Hoy! What do you think you're doing¦31732 untying that donkey?”
\p
\v 6 So¦31737 they responded just as \nd Yeshua¦31746\nd* had told them, and¦31737 the people allowed¦31748 them to proceed.
\v 7 They brought the young donkey to Yeshua, placing their¦31767 coats¦31765 over it before Yeshua mounted it.
\v 8 \add As Yeshua rode it into Yerushalem,\add* many people laid their¦31783 coats¦31781 on the road¦31790, while others¦31792 lay down leafy¦31794 branches¦31794 cut from trees in nearby fields¦31799.

\v 10 the promised ancestor of King David¦31833 who is blessed as he ushers in his kingdom¦31826—the blessed saviour¦31834 from heaven.”
\p
\v 11 And so Yeshua arrived in Yerushalem and went into the temple¦31849 and looked¦31851 all around¦31851, but because it was now evening¦31853, he went back out to Bethania village with his twelve¦31864 apprentices.

\v 13 From a distance he noticed a fig¦31881 tree¦31881 that was in leaf so he went¦31888 over to see if there was any fruit on it, but when he reached it there was only leaves because¦31922 it wasn't the right season¦31925 for figs¦31929.

\v 2 \wj At harvest time, he sent a slave¦32460 to go to the tenant farmers and¦32453 get his \+add percentage\+add* of the harvest.\wj*

\v 4 \wj The owner sent¦32491 a second slave¦32495, but they¦32500 insulted this one and¦32489 struck¦32500 him on the head.\wj*
\v 5 \wj So¦32506 the owner sent a third slave and they murdered him. He sent many other slaves—some they just beat up and others they murdered.\wj*
\v 6 \wj But the owner still¦32527 had his one, dearly loved son, so finally he sent¦32539 him to go, thinking that they would now be convinced because it was his son.\wj*
\v 7 \wj But the tenant¦32557 farmers¦32557 said¦32564 to each others, ‘Ah ha. This is the one who will inherit¦32577 this land. If we kill¦32571 \+em him¦32572\+em*, we'll be the ones to control the estate.’\wj*
\v 8 \wj So¦32578 they took him and killed¦32581 him, and threw the body outside¦32586 the vineyard¦32588 fence.\wj*
\p
\v 9 “\wj Now, what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? Yes, he'll come and eliminate those \+add evil\+add* tenants¦32600, and give the contract to others¦32605.\wj*

\v 21 So then the second¦32875 brother took¦32876 her¦32877 in, but again died¦32879 childless, and then the third¦32890.

\v 60 Nevertheless the chief¦35541 priest¦35541 in the middle of the council stood¦35539 up and¦35538 asked¦35545 \nd Yeshua\nd*, “Aren't you going to defend yourself? These men¦35554 are accusing you of these¦35554 things.”
\p
\v 61 But Yeshua didn't¦35565 say anything. So the chief¦35573 priest¦35573 asked again, “Is it true that you're the \nd chosen¦35587\nd* one that God promised to send—the son of the blessed¦35593 \add God\add*?”

\p
\v 70 But¦35805 again Peter¦35814 denied it.
\p A little¦35807 while later, some of those standing there said, “You must be one of them because¦35820 you're¦35818 from Galilee¦35821.”
\p
\v 71 Now Peter started swearing¦35834 and cursing¦35831 and said, “I've never even met that fellow that you're all talking¦35842 about!”
\p
\v 72 Right then¦35843 the rooster crowed for the second¦35846 time¦35846 and Peter¦35853 remembered now what Yeshua had told him—how he would renounce¦35876 Yeshua three¦35874 times before the rooster crowed—and he broke¦35879 down and cried.

\v 1 First thing in the morning¦35887, the chief¦35893 priests¦35893 called a meeting with the elders¦35896 and the religious¦35900 teachers¦35900 and all the council¦35905, and they ordered that \nd Yeshua\nd* be tied up and taken over to Governor Pilate¦35919.
\v 2 There Pilate¦35924 asked¦35921 him, “Are you the king¦35929 of the Jews?”
\p “\wj You said it¦35940,\wj*” replied Yeshua.
\p
\v 3 Then¦35941 the chief¦35946 priests¦35946 started hurling accusations¦35942 against¦35944 Yeshua,
\v 4 so Pilate¦35954 asked¦35956 him¦35958 again, “Don't you have anything to say? Listen¦35964 to all these accusations¦35968 they're making against you.”
\p
\v 5 But Pilate¦35979 was astounded that \nd Yeshua\nd* didn't answer¦35975 any further.

\p
\v 6 Now at time of the Jewish Passover, Pilate would normally pardon one prisoner¦35991 for them and¦35981 release him.
\v 7 There was another prisoner at the time named Barabbas¦36003 who was an activist accused of murder¦36013.
\v 8 By now, the crowd¦36022 had arrived and¦36017 asked Pilate to release a prisoner as usual at Passover,
\v 9 so he asked them, “Do you want me to release the King of the Jews for you?”
\v 10 (This was because Pilate was well aware that the chief¦36058 priests¦36058 had brought Yeshua because they were jealous of his \add popularity\add*.)
\v 11 But the chief¦36061 priests¦36061 stirred¦36063 up the crowd¦36066 to start saying that it was Barabbas¦36072 that they wanted released,
\v 12 so Pilate¦36077 asked again¦36078, “Then¦36076 what should I do with this man that¦36088 you¦36089 call the King of the Jews?”
\p
\v 13 The crowd yelled¦36098 back, “Execute¦36101 him¦36102 on a pole.”
\p
\v 14 “What has he even done wrong?” Pilate¦36105 demanded.
\p But¦36104 they just yelled¦36117 louder, “Execute¦36120 him on a pole!”
\p
\v 15 Now Pilate¦36124 wanted to placate the crowd¦36127, so he had Barabbas¦36138 released while he had \nd Yeshua\nd* flogged¦36145 and¦36123 then¦36123 handed over to the execution¦36148 squad.

\v 17 They \add mocked Yeshua\add* by dressing¦36170 him in a kingly robe, and¦36169 after someone twisted¦36178 some thorns¦36179 together¦36178 into a mock crown¦36180, they pressed it onto his head,
\v 18 and¦36181 began¦36182 saluting him¦36184, “Greetings¦36187, king¦36190 of the Jews.”
\v 19 They took turns whacking his¦36195 head with a stick and spitting¦36204 on him, while others knelt down in front of him and pretended to be bowing to him.
\v 20 After they'd finished having fun mocking him, they took the purple¦36220 robe off him, and¦36213 put his¦36227 own robe back on him. Then¦36213 they led him outside towards the execution¦36235 spot.

He was Simon¦36243 from Cyrene¦36246, the father¦36252 of Alexander¦36253 and Rufus¦36255, and the soldiers forced him¦36260 to carry¦36257 the execution¦36259 pole,
\v 22 and¦36261 so they¦36263 all arrived at Golgotha¦36268 (which¦36270 means ‘Place¦36275 of the skull¦36275’).
\v 23 There the soldiers went to give some spiced wine to Yeshua, but¦36286 he¦36288 declined it.
\v 24 \x + \xo 15:24: \xt Psa 22:18.\x*So¦36289 they¦36294 carried out the execution¦36290, taking Yeshua's clothes¦36297 and¦36304 drawing straws to see who would get what.
\v 25 By now it¦36307 was around 9am, and¦36312 they¦36314 affixed Yeshua to the pole.
\v 26 The charge¦36322 had been written out and¦36316 attached \add at the top\add*: “The king¦36328 of the Jews.”
\v 27 That morning, two¦36337 thieves were also executed¦36334 there—one on each side of Yeshua.

\v 30 come¦36387 down from that pole and save¦36383 yourself¦36384.”
\p
\v 31 Similarly¦36391 the chief¦36395 priests¦36395 and the religious¦36402 teachers¦36402 laughed together and mocked, “He did miracles for others¦36404, but he can't¦36407 even save¦36409 himself¦36406.
\v 32 The so-called ‘\nd chosen¦36411\nd* one’ or ‘king¦36413 of Yisrael’. Now, if he'd just come¦36416 down from there, then¦36427 we'd be able to believe¦36425 him.”

\p
\v 35 Some of the people standing nearby thought he was calling¦36497 the prophet Eliyah \add (Elijah¦36496)\add*.
\v 36 \x + \xo 15:36: \xt Psa 69:21.\x*One of them ran, and soaked a sponge¦36507 in some sour wine, then¦36501 put it on a stick and held it up for Yeshua to drink¦36513, saying¦36515, “Hang on. Let's see¦36519 if Eliyah does come to get him down.”
\p
\v 37 But¦36526 just then¦36526 \nd Yeshua¦36527\nd* uttered a loud¦36530 cry¦36529 and¦36526 exhaled his last breath.

\p
\v 42 As evening¦36628 came, it was now the Preparation Day, i.e., the day before the Rest Day.
\v 43 Yosef (who'd come¦36641 from the city of Arimathea¦36646 and one who was waiting¦36654 for the coming of God's kingdom¦36656), a prominent¦36647 council¦36648 member¦36648, steeled himself¦36652 up and went¦36661 in to see the governor to get permission to transfer \nd Yeshua's\nd* body¦36669.
\v 44 Governor Pilate¦36674 didn't think he'd be dead yet, so he called¦36683 an army commander to find out if Yeshua had indeed died.
\v 45 As soon as he found out, he gave Yosef permission,
\v 46 so Yosef \add and his companions\add* went and bought¦36713 some linen burial cloth and then¦36710, removing Yeshua's body from the pole, wrapped¦36721 it in the cloth and placed it in a burial chamber that¦36737 had been chiselled into a rockface. Then¦36710 they rolled¦36744 a rock¦36742 across the opening.
\v 47 Others were watching and noted where¦36772 the body had been laid, including Maria from Magdala¦36759 and Maria who was Yoses' mother¦36762.

\p
\v 1 After the Rest Day was over, Maria from Magdala¦36783 and Maria the mother¦36786 of Yacob and Salome¦36790, went and bought¦36792 some traditional burial spices¦36793 that evening to take to the burial chamber and place with the body.
\v 2 Then¦36800 very early¦36803 on Sunday morning they¦36811 went to the chamber, arriving just as the sun¦36820 was rising.
\v 3 But¦36821 they realised that they didn't have anyone with them to roll the rock¦36835 away that was covering the entrance.
\v 4 However, when they looked¦36847 they saw that the very large¦36863 rock¦36860 had already been rolled¦36854 away.
\v 5 So¦36866 they went on into the burial chamber and¦36866 were totally stunned to find a young¦36874 man¦36874 dressed in white¦36882, sitting¦36876 in there on the side.
\p
\v 6 He assured them, “Don't be surprised. I know you're looking¦36902 for¦36902 \nd Yeshua\nd* from \nd Nazareth¦36904\nd*, the one who was executed¦36907 on a pole. But¦36888 see¦36912 there where¦36920 his body was—he's not there because he came back to life.

\p
