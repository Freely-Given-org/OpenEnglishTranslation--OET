\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk Second Shemuel\bk* (commonly, but wrongly known as ‘Samuel’) is the continuation of \bk First Shemuel\bk*—the two parts together are considered a single ‘book’ in the Jewish Bible—it's only split into two because it was too long to fit on a single scroll.
\ip This the story of David's reign: firstly he ruled what became known as ‘Yehudah’ (Judah) in the south east (chapters 1–4), and eventually, the entire nation, including the much larger area of Yisrael (called ‘Israel’ in older translations) in the north east (Chapter 5–24). This document explains how David dealt with his enemies within the country, as well as battling with other nations in order to widen and strengthen his kingdom. David's faith and respect of God is demonstrated here, as well as his love for the people. However, despite that, he was also fierce and he was quite capable of disobeying God to get what he wanted. But God sees everything and seen his prophet Natan (Nathan) with a parable to show David his selfishness. David asked for forgiven for his sin and accepted the punishment that God gave him.
\ip The times of peace and prosperity through the latter parts of David's rule were planted in the minds of the Hebrew people, and in the future when they faced difficulties, they would long for another king like David—a son (better ‘a descendant’) of David who would love God like him.

\p
\v 8 These are the names¦154532 of David's¦154535 \add top\add* warriors:
\p \bd Yoshev-Bashshevet\bd* the Tahkemonite¦154538 was the head of ‘The Three’. One time¦154551 he attacked and killed eight¦154548 hundred¦154549 men with his spear¦154544.
\p
\v 9 Next after him was \bd Eleazar¦154558\bd*, the son of Ahohi's son Dodo¦154561. \add Once he was\add* among the three¦154566 powerful warriors with David¦154571 when they taunted the Philistines¦154573 who were gathered¦154574 there¦154576 for battle¦154577. The Israeli warriors \add ≈retreated back up\add* their hill,
\v 10 \add but\add* \add @Eleazar\add* \add ≈moved forward and attacked the Philistines¦154585 until¦154586 his arm became weak, and his hand cramped around\add* his sword. Yahweh¦154598 \add ≈achieved\add* a great¦154600 victory¦154599 that day¦154601, and the \add ≈other warriors\add* only returned¦154604 afterwards to plunder \add the dead\add*.
\p
\v 11 Then there was Agge's son \bd Shamma¦154612\bd*, the Hararite¦154616. The Philistines had assembled¦154617 in formation¦154619 where there happened to be a field¦154624 full of lentils¦154626. The \add ≈Israelis\add* fled from the Philistines
\v 12 \add ≈but\add* \add @Shamma\add* remained there in the middle¦154633 of the field and killed¦154637 \add many\add* Philistines¦154640. \add ≈So¦154632 the field was saved\add*, and Yahweh¦154642 \add ≈achieved\add* a great¦154644 victory¦154643.
\p
\v 13 \add Once\add* as it was approaching harvest¦154655 time, three¦154648 of ‘The Thirty’ went¦154647 to where David¦154658 \add had been staying\add* at Adullam's¦154662 cave. There was a Philistine unit camped in the Refaim¦154667 valley¦154666.
\v 14 At the time, David¦154669 was in the fortress, and¦154672 there was \add another\add* Philistine unit in Beyt-Lehem.
\v 15 David¦154679 \add ≈was thirsty\add* \add one day\add* and¦154680 \add ≈asked\add*, “Who'll \add ≈get me a drink¦154682 of water¦154683\add* from the Beyt-Lehem well by the gate?”
\v 16 \add ≈So¦154691\add* the three¦154692 powerful¦154693 warriors \add ≈broke¦154691 through\add* the Philistine camp and got water¦154698 from the Beyt-Lehem well near the gate. They carried¦154705 it back to David¦154709, but he wouldn't drink¦154712 it—pouring it out instead \add as an offering\add* to Yahweh¦154715,
\v 17 saying, “Far be it for me, Yahweh¦154720, \add ≈to drink\add* this—the blood¦154723 of the men¦154724 who \add ≈risked\add* their¦154726 lives¦154726.” \add ≈So¦154717\add* he wasn't willing¦154728 to drink it.

\p
\v 20 Yehoyada's son \bd Benayah¦154778\bd* from Kavtsael was a man¦154784 of military prowess with many deeds¦154790 \add to his name\add*. \add Once\add* he killed ‘The Two’ from Moab¦154797, and \add another time\add* he went¦154799 down in a pit on a snowy¦154808 day¦154807 and killed the lion¦154803 in the pit.

\v 2 \add ≈So¦155031\add* the king¦155032 told Yoav¦155035, the commander¦155037 of his army, who was with him \add at the time\add*, “\add ≈Travel throughout\add* all the \add regions of\add* the Israeli tribes¦155048, from Dan¦155050 \add (in the far north)\add* down to Beer¦155053-Sheva \add (in the far south)\add*, and count the people so that I'll know the number¦155061 of \add ≈fighting men\add*.”

\v 10 \add ≈However, David¦155211 had a guilty conscience\add* after¦155213 he'd had the people¦155219 counted¦155216 and he told Yahweh, “I've \add ≈disobeyed you badly, but\add* now, Yahweh, please¦155234 \add ≈take¦155232 away\add* the iniquity¦155237 of your servant¦155238 because I've been very foolish¦155240.”
