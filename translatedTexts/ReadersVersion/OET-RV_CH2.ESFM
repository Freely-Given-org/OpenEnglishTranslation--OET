\is1 Introduction
\ip The \bk Second Chronicles\bk* account is the continuation of \bk First Chronicles\bk* account (and they're considered as just one account in the book form of the Hebrew Scripturesthe TaNaK). This document includes the account of Shelomoh (Solomon) becoming king, then the rebellion of the northern tribes against his son Rehoboam becoming king. That rebellion was led by Yeroboam (Jeroboam) and resulted in the split between the northern kingdom (called ‘Yisrael/Israel’ or sometimes ‘Efrayim/Ephraim’) and the southern king (called ‘Yehudah/Judah’ and consisting mostly of the tribes of Yehudah and Benyamin). This document then ends with the accounts of the kingdom of Yehudah (Judah) and the defeat of Yerushalem (Jerusalem) in 586 B.C.

\v 1 David's¦200723 son Shelomoh¦200720 \add (Solomon¦200720)\add* became established¦200719 over his kingdom¦200726 and his god¦200728, Yahweh¦200727, was with him and \add ≈made him very powerful\add*.
\p
\v 2 Shelomoh spoke to all Yisrael \add (Israel¦200737)\add*, to the army commanders¦200738 of thousands¦200739 and¦200733 of hundreds¦200740, to the judges¦200741, to all of Yisrael's leaders, including the clan leaders.
\v 3 \add ≈So¦200750\add* Shelomoh led all the assembly¦200754 to the \add ≈worship place¦200756\add* at Gibeon¦200758 because the \add ≈sacred tent\add* was there¦200761 that¦200757 Yahweh's servant¦200769 Mosheh¦200768 \add (Moses¦200768)\add* had made in the wilderness¦200772.
\v 4 David¦200778 had brought¦200777 God's box uphill from Kiryat-Yearim \add and\add* \add *he'd\add* erected a tent for it in Yerushalem¦200789 \add (Jerusalem)\add*.\x + \xo 1:4: \xt 2Sam 6:1-17; 1Ch 13:5-14; 15:25–16:1.\x*

\v 6 \add ≈So¦200810\add* Shelomoh¦200811 went up to the bronze¦200816 altar¦200815 there¦200812 at the \add ≈sacred tent\add*, and¦200810 \add ≈in front¦200817 of\add* Yahweh¦200818, he sacrificed one thousand¦200825 burnt¦200824 offerings¦200824 on it.
\p
\v 7 That night¦200827, God¦200830 appeared¦200829 to Shelomoh and¦200832 told him, “Ask for what \add you want\add* me to give¦200836 you.”
\p
\v 8 “You showed outstanding loyal¦200849 commitment to my father¦200848 David¦200847,” Shelomoh \add ≈replied\add* to God¦200842, “and¦200851 you've made me king¦200851 in his place¦200852.
\v 9 Now, Yahweh¦200855 God¦200856, may your¦200858 promise¦200858 to my father¦200861 David¦200860 be confirmed, for you¦200863 yourself have made me king¦200864 over a people¦200867 as numerous¦200868 as the dust on the ground.

\p
\v 11 “Because that was in your¦200915 heart¦200906,” God¦200897 \add ≈replied\add* to Shelomoh “and you didn't ask for wealth¦200910, riches¦200911, or \add ≈fame\add*, or the life of those who hate you, and also you didn't ask \add ≈for a long life\add*, but you've asked for wisdom¦200925 and knowledge¦200926 for yourself¦200924 \add ≈to help you lead\add* my people¦200931 that I've made you king¦200933 over,

\v 8 \add ≈Also,\add* send to me cedar, cypress, and algum timber from \add there in\add* Lebanon, because I myself know that¦201248 your servants know how to cut the trees from Lebanon's \add forests\add*. And listen, my servants will \add ≈help\add* your servants
\v 9 so they can supply me with plenty of timber¦201261, because the temple that I'm¦201262 building will be large and beautiful.

\p
\v 11 King Hiram of Tsor \add (Tyre)\add* wrote back to \add King\add* Shelomoh, “Yahweh¦201308 has appointed you as king¦201322 over his people because he loves them.

\v 5 \add ≈Don't you¦205943 all understand\add* that Yisrael's god¦205948 Yahweh¦205946 \add ≈made a formal agreement\add* that the kingdom of Yisrael was given¦205950 forever¦205956 to David¦205952 and¦205958 his descendants?
\v 6 \add ≈But\add* Nevat's son Yaraveam, who was a servant¦205968 of David's¦205972 son Shelomoh, \add ≈took action\add* and rebelled¦205973 against his master¦205976,

\v 10 “\add ≈But\add* as for us, Yahweh is our¦206059 god¦206059 and we haven't abandoned¦206061 him¦206061. Our priests¦206062 who minister to Yahweh are Aharon's descendants¦206065, and the Levites¦206067 \add ≈assist them\add*.
\v 11 \add ≈Every morning and every evening\add*, they sacrifice burnt¦206072 offerings¦206070 to Yahweh, and spiced incense¦206079.

\v 6 He fortified Yehudah's¦206388 cities¦206393 as the place was quiet without war during those years, because Yahweh¦206407 had given¦206410 him¦206409 \add ≈peace\add*

\v 5 Yehoshafat stood¦208506 in front of all the people from Yerushalem¦208510 and¦208510 across Yehudah¦208509, in front of the new temple courtyard¦208514
\v 6 and \add ≈prayed\add*, “Yahweh¦208518, the god of our ancestors¦208520, aren't¦208521 you the god \add who lives\add* in the heavens¦208526? And you rule in all the kingdoms¦208530 \add ≈around the world\add*, and \add ≈you have full power¦208533 and control\add*—no one can stand¦208537 against¦208536 you.
\v 7 Weren't you our god¦208542 who drove the previous inhabitants¦208546 of this land out ahead of your Israeli people¦208550? Didn't you give¦208552 it¦208552 to the descendants¦208553 of Abraham¦208554—the one you loved forever¦208556?\x + \xo 20:7: \xt Isa 41:8; Jam 2:23.\x*
\v 8 \add @Our ancestors\add* lived¦208558 in \add @this land\add* and¦208561 they¦208558 built¦208561 a \add ≈temple to honour you\add*, saying,
\v 9 ‘If disaster \add like\add* \add ≈war\add*, judgement¦208575, or epidemic, or famine¦208577 comes on us, we'll stand¦208578 \add ≈in front of\add* this \add ≈temple\add*, and \add ≈in front of\add* you, because your¦208583 name¦208585 is \add ≈honoured here\add*. And we will cry¦208588 to you from our distress¦208590, and you will hear¦208591 and deliver.’
\p
\v 10 You didn't allow our Israeli ancestors to enter the countries of Ammon¦208598, Moab¦208599, or Edom when they were travelling from Egypt¦208612 \add to Canaan\add*. So¦208594 our ancestors turned¦208614 away from those areas and¦208594 didn't destroy¦208617 them, but now they \add are coming here to attack us\add*.\x + \xo 20:10: \xt Deu 2:4-19.\x*
\v 11 Look how they're repaying¦208622 us \add for not destroying them\add*—they come \add here\add* to drive¦208625 us out from the \add ≈land\add* that¦208627 you gave¦208628 us as an inheritance¦208628.
\v 12 \add So,\add* our god¦208630, \add ≈please punish\add* them, because \add ≈we're not strong enough to battle this huge¦208641 army that's on its way\add*. \add ≈We simply don't¦208631 know¦208647 what to do, so we're looking to you to rescue us\add*.”
\p
\v 13 \add At that time,\add* all of Yehudah¦208657 (men, women, and¦208665 children¦208665) were standing¦208658 \add ≈in front¦208659 of\add* Yahweh¦208660
\v 14 and Yahweh's spirit¦208688 came on Yahaziel. (Yahaziel was the son of Zekaryah, son of Benayah¦208674, son of Yeiel¦208677, son of Mattanyah¦208680 the Levite¦208681 and a descendant¦208684 of Asaf¦208685.) In the middle¦208690 of the assembly¦208691
\v 15 he said¦208693, “\add ≈Pay\add* attention¦208694, all Yehudah¦208697 and inhabitants¦208698 of Yerushalem¦208699 and King Yehoshafat¦208701. Yahweh¦208705 has this to say to you all, ‘Don't be afraid¦208710, and don't¦208708 be dismayed¦208713 by this \add ≈huge¦208716 force\add*, because it's not your battle¦208721 but God's.\x + \xo 20:15-17: \xt Deu 20:1-4.\x*
\v 16 Tomorrow¦208725, go¦208726 down against¦208727 them. Listen, they're coming¦208729 uphill near the Ascent of Tsits, and¦208732 you'll all find them at the end¦208734 of the valley¦208735, facing the Yeruel¦208738 wilderness¦208737.
\v 17 You all won't¦208754 \add need\add* to fight¦208742 \add ≈them\add*—\add ≈Just take¦208744 your positions all of you from Yerushalem¦208753 and wider Yehudah¦208752, and watch Yahweh save you\add*.

\p
\v 18 Then¦208766 \add King\add* Yehoshafat bowed¦208766 with his face to the ground¦208769, and all \add the people from\add* Yerushalem¦208774 and across Yehudah¦208772 fell \add to their knees\add* in front¦208776 of Yahweh¦208777 to worship¦208778 \add *him\add*.
\v 19 Then¦208781 \add some of\add* the Levites¦208782 who were descendants of Kohat and¦208787 Korah, stood¦208781 up to \add ≈loudly\add* praise¦208791 Yisrael's god¦208793 Yahweh¦208792.
\p
\v 20 They rose early¦208799 the \add next\add* morning¦208800 and went out to the Tekoa¦208803 wilderness¦208802, and \add ≈as they were leaving\add* Yehoshafat stood¦208805 and \add ≈called out\add*, “Hear me, inhabitants¦208810 of Yerushalem¦208811 and Yehudah¦208809. Believe in \add ≈our\add* god¦208814 Yahweh, and be \add ≈confident\add*. Believe his prophets¦208817 and succeed¦208818.”
\v 21 Then¦208820 he consulted with the people¦208823, and he appointed¦208824 some to sing to Yahweh and some to praise¦208827 \add ≈him for his splendour¦208828 and sinlessness\add* as they went¦208831 out before the \add enemy\add* army, and they were saying¦208834, “Give thanks¦208835 to Yahweh, because his loyal commitment \add endures\add* forever¦208838.”
\p
\v 22 As they began¦208842 to sing and praise¦208844 Yahweh¦208846, he sent ambushers¦208848 against¦208858 the \add ≈Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites\add* who were attacking Yehudah¦208858, and they were defeated¦208859.
\v 23 Then¦208861 the \add ≈Ammonites and Moabites turned on the Edomites and completely annihilated¦208872 them\add*, and \add ≈after that\add* they \add ≈slaughtered each other\add*.
\v 24 \add ≈When the men of Yehudah arrived at the place overlooking the wilderness¦208887, wow¦208892, they¦208892 saw corpses¦208893 all over the ground\add*. No one had escaped¦208897.
\p
\v 25 Then¦208899 Yehoshafat¦208900 and his people¦208901 went¦208899 to plunder the spoils, and they found¦208906 lots of goods¦208909 among them, as well as clothing,\f + \fr 20:25 \ft The Hebrew ‘bodies/corpses’ seems wrong here.\f* and valuable items. They took that for themselves \add ≈until¦208915 there was nothing left to\add* carry¦208916 away—there was \add ≈so much plunder that it took three¦208919 days¦208918 to collect it all\add*.
\v 26 On the fourth¦208930 day, they assembled¦208931 in the Berakah valley and¦208929 they praised Yahweh¦208940 there¦208936. That's why it's called¦208944 Berakah valley \add (which means ‘praise/blessing¦208937’)\add* to this day.
\v 27 Then¦208956 all the men from Yerushalem and¦208956 \add across\add* Yehudah¦208960 returned¦208956 to Yerushalem with \add King\add* Yehoshafat \add ≈leading them\add*—celebrating because Yahweh¦208972 had enabled them to defeat their enemies¦208973.
\v 28 \add ≈When¦208983\add* they arrived at Yerushalem¦208976, they went¦208975 to the \add ≈temple\add*, \add playing\add* harps¦208977, lutes, and¦208975 trumpets¦208979.
\v 29 The nearby kingdoms¦208991 \add ≈were all very afraid of\add* God¦208987 when they¦208993 heard¦208993 that Yahweh¦208996 had fought¦208995 with Yisrael's enemies¦208998,
\v 30 \add ≈so\add* Yehoshafat's¦209003 kingdom¦209002 was untroubled and¦209004 his god¦209006 gave¦209004 him \add ≈peace¦209001 from all his neighbours\add*.

\v 31 Yehoshafat was thirty-five \add ≈years old\add* when he became¦209020 king¦209020, and he reigned over Yehudah¦209014 from Yerushalem¦209025 for twenty-five years. His mother¦209027 was Shilhi's¦209031 daughter¦209029, Azuvah.
\v 32 He \add ≈had similar priorities to his father¦209035 Asa¦209036, doing¦209041 what pleased\add* Yahweh¦209044, and¦209033 he didn't¦209037 \add ≈deviate\add* from that.

\p
\v 34 \add ≈Everything else that¦209072 Yehoshafat¦209062 did from the beginning to the end\add* \add of his reign\add* was written¦209066 down by Hanani's¦209071 son Yehu¦209068 in the scroll¦209076 about Yisrael's kings¦209077.

\v 35 \add ≈Later on,\add* Yehudah's¦209087 King Yehoshafat \add ≈made an alliance¦209083\add* with Yisrael's King Ahazyah¦209089 (which was a wicked¦209094 thing to do),
\v 36 and¦209097 they worked together to make ships at Etsyon-Gever to sail to Tarshish¦209102.
\v 37 Then¦209108 Dodavahu's¦209112 son Eliezer¦209109 from Mareshah¦209113 prophesied¦209108 against Yehoshafat, saying, “When you allied yourself with Ahazyah¦209121, Yahweh¦209123 broke through your¦209126 works.” \add ≈In due course,\add* the ships¦209128 were damaged and¦209108 unable to \add ≈sail\add* to Tarshish¦209134.

\v 6 He did \add many of the evil things\add* that Yisrael's kings¦209230 had done, because \add ≈he married one\add* of \add King\add* Ahav's daughters¦209237 and¦209227 did things that Yahweh¦209246 \add ≈had said\add* were evil.

\p
\v 12 Then \add @King Yehoram\add* received a written message from the prophet¦209352 Eliyah¦209351 \add (Elijah¦209351)\add*: “Your father David's¦209359 god¦209358 Yahweh¦209357 says that because¦209361 you \add decided\add* not to \add ≈follow\add* the ways of your father Yehoshafat¦209367 or those of \add good\add* King Asa¦209370,
