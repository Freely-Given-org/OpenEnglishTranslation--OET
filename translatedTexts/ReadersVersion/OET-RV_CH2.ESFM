\v 1 David's¦200723 son Shelomoh¦200720 \add (Solomon¦200720)\add* became established¦200719 over his kingdom¦200726 and his god¦200728, Yahweh¦200727, was with him and \add ≈made him very powerful\add*.
\p
\v 2 Shelomoh spoke to all Yisrael \add (Israel¦200737)\add*, to the army commanders¦200738 of thousands¦200739 and of hundreds¦200740, to the judges¦200741, to all of Yisrael's leaders, including the clan leaders.
\v 3 \add ≈So¦200750\add* Shelomoh led all the assembly¦200754 to the \add ≈worship place¦200756\add* at Gibeon¦200758 because the \add ≈sacred tent\add* was there¦200761 that Yahweh's servant¦200769 Mosheh¦200768 \add (Moses¦200768)\add* had made in the wilderness¦200772.
\v 4 David¦200778 had brought¦200777 God's box uphill from Kiryat-Yearim \add and\add* \add *he'd\add* erected a tent for it in Yerushalem¦200789 \add (Jerusalem)\add*.\x + \xo 1:4: \xt 2Sam 6:1-17; 1Ch 13:5-14; 15:25–16:1.\x*

\v 6 \add ≈So¦200810\add* Shelomoh¦200811 went up to the bronze¦200816 altar¦200815 there¦200812 at the \add ≈sacred tent\add*, and \add ≈in front¦200817 of\add* Yahweh¦200818, he sacrificed one thousand¦200825 burnt¦200824 offerings¦200824 on it.

\v 7 That night¦200827, God¦200830 appeared¦200829 to Shelomoh and¦200832 told him, “Ask for what \add you want\add* me to give¦200836 you.”
\p
\v 8 “You showed outstanding loyal¦200849 commitment to my father¦200848 David¦200847,” Shelomoh \add ≈replied\add* to God¦200842, “and¦200851 you've made me king¦200851 in his place¦200852.
\v 9 Now, Yahweh¦200855 God¦200856, may your¦200858 promise¦200858 to my father¦200861 David¦200860 be confirmed, for you¦200863 yourself have made me king¦200864 over a people¦200867 as numerous¦200868 as the dust on the ground.

\p
\v 11 “Because that was in your¦200915 heart¦200906,” God¦200897 \add ≈replied\add* to Shelomoh “and you didn't ask for wealth¦200910, riches¦200911, or \add ≈fame\add*, or the life of those who hate you, and also you didn't ask \add ≈for a long life\add*, but you've asked for wisdom¦200925 and knowledge¦200926 for yourself¦200924 \add ≈to help you lead\add* my people¦200931 that I've made you king¦200933 over,

\v 1 Then¦201472 Shelomoh began¦201472 to build¦201474 Yahweh's temple on Mt. Moriyah in Yerushalem¦201480, where \add @Yahweh\add* had appeared¦201484 to his father¦201486 David.

\v 5 For the \add ≈main building\add*, he overlaid it first with cypress¦201550 planking, then with pure gold¦201552, then \add ≈carved\add* palm trees¦201556 and chains¦201557 \add along the walls\add*.

\p
\v 8 Then he made the\add ≈most sacred¦201591 room¦201591\add* \add inside\add* the temple. It was nine metres¦201600 long \add (the full width of the temple)\add* and the same width.

\p \add ≈However\add* war \add started\add* between Aviyah and Yaraveam.

\p
\v 4 Aviyah \add ≈stood on the top of\add* Mt. Tsemarayim in the Efrayim hill-country and \add ≈shouted\add*, “Yaraveam and all Yisrael, listen¦205936 to me.
\v 5 \add ≈Don't you¦205943 all understand\add* that Yisrael's god¦205948 Yahweh¦205946 \add ≈made a formal agreement\add* that the kingdom of Yisrael was given¦205950 forever¦205956 to David¦205952 and¦205958 his descendants?
\v 6 \add ≈But\add* Nevat's son Yaraveam, who was a servant¦205968 of David's¦205972 son Shelomoh, \add ≈took action\add* and rebelled¦205973 against his master¦205976,

\v 9 Didn't you all drive¦206025 out the Levites¦206034, as well as Yahweh's priests who were Aharon's descendants¦206032?

\v 10 “\add ≈But\add* as for us, Yahweh is our¦206059 God¦206059 and we haven't abandoned¦206061 him¦206061. Our priests¦206062 who minister to Yahweh are Aharon's descendants¦206065, and the Levites¦206067 \add ≈assist them\add*.
\v 11 \add ≈Every morning and every evening\add*, they sacrifice burnt¦206072 offerings¦206070 to Yahweh, and spiced incense¦206079.

\v 16 Yisrael's \add ≈soldiers\add* fled away from Yehudah's¦206184 \add army\add*, and God¦206186 \add ≈enabled Yehudah to defeat them\add*.

\v 6 He fortified Yehudah's¦206388 cities¦206393 as the place was quiet without war during those years, because Yahweh¦206407 had given¦206410 him¦206409 \add ≈peace\add*
