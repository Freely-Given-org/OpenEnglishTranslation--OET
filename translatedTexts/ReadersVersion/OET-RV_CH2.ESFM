\v 1 David's¦200723 son Shelomoh¦200720 \add (Solomon¦200720)\add* became established¦200719 over his kingdom¦200726 and his god¦200728, Yahweh¦200727, was with him and \add ≈made him very powerful\add*.
\p
\v 2 Shelomoh spoke to all Yisrael \add (Israel¦200737)\add*, to the army commanders¦200738 of thousands¦200739 and of hundreds¦200740, to the judges¦200741, to all of Yisrael's leaders, including the clan leaders.
\v 3 \add ≈So¦200750\add* Shelomoh led all the assembly¦200754 to the \add ≈worship place¦200756\add* at Gibeon¦200758 because the \add ≈sacred tent\add* was there¦200761 that Yahweh's servant¦200769 Mosheh¦200768 \add (Moses¦200768)\add* had made in the wilderness¦200772.
\v 4 David¦200778 had brought¦200777 God's box uphill from Kiryat-Yearim \add and\add* \add *he'd\add* erected a tent for it in Yerushalem¦200789 \add (Jerusalem)\add*.\x + \xo 1:4: \xt 2Sam 6:1-17; 1Ch 13:5-14; 15:25–16:1.\x*

\v 6 \add ≈So¦200810\add* Shelomoh¦200811 went up to the bronze¦200816 altar¦200815 there¦200812 at the \add ≈sacred tent\add*, and \add ≈in front¦200817 of\add* Yahweh¦200818, he sacrificed one thousand¦200825 burnt¦200824 offerings¦200824 on it.

\v 7 That night¦200827, God¦200830 appeared¦200829 to Shelomoh and¦200832 told him, “Ask for what \add you want\add* me to give¦200836 you.”
\p
\v 8 “You showed outstanding loyal¦200849 commitment to my father¦200848 David¦200847,” Shelomoh \add ≈replied\add* to God¦200842, “and¦200851 you've made me king¦200851 in his place¦200852.
\v 9 Now, Yahweh¦200855 God¦200856, may your¦200858 promise¦200858 to my father¦200861 David¦200860 be confirmed, for you¦200863 yourself have made me king¦200864 over a people¦200867 as numerous¦200868 as the dust on the ground.

\p
\v 11 “Because that was in your¦200915 heart¦200906,” God¦200897 \add ≈replied\add* to Shelomoh “and you didn't ask for wealth¦200910, riches¦200911, or \add ≈fame\add*, or the life of those who hate you, and also you didn't ask \add ≈for a long life\add*, but you've asked for wisdom¦200925 and knowledge¦200926 for yourself¦200924 \add ≈to help you lead\add* my people¦200931 that I've made you king¦200933 over,

\v 8 \add ≈Also,\add* send to me cedar, cypress, and algum timber from \add there in\add* Lebanon, because I myself know that your servants know how to cut the trees from Lebanon's \add forests\add*. And listen, my servants will \add ≈help\add* your servants

\v 1 Then¦201472 Shelomoh began¦201472 to build¦201474 Yahweh's temple on Mt. Moriyah in Yerushalem¦201480, where \add @Yahweh\add* had appeared¦201484 to his father¦201486 David.

\v 3 \add ≈The temple foundation¦201505 was twenty-seven metres long and¦201518 nine metres wide\add*,

\v 5 For the \add ≈main building\add*, he overlaid it first with cypress¦201550 planking, then with pure gold¦201552, then \add ≈carved\add* palm trees¦201556 and chains¦201557 \add along the walls\add*.

\p
\v 8 Then he made the\add ≈most sacred¦201591 room¦201591\add* \add inside\add* the temple. It was nine metres¦201600 long \add (the full width of the temple)\add* and the same width.

\p
\v 7 When Yahweh¦205661 saw¦205660 that they'd humbled themselves, \add ≈he gave this\add* message¦205665 to Shemayah¦205671, “They've humbled themselves \add so\add* I won't destroy¦205676 them—my rage won't pour out on Yerushalem¦205685 \add ≈using Shishak's¦205688 attack\add*, and I'll give them \add ≈a way to recover\add* \add in the future\add*.

\rem /s1 Abijah Reigns over Judah; Abijah King of Judah; Abijah's War with Jeroboam
\s4 Both kingdoms
\r (1 Kgs 15:1-8)
\p
\v 1 In the eighteenth¦205869 year¦205868 of \add the reign of\add* King Yaraveam \add (Jeroboam)\add*, Aviyah \add started his\add* reign over Yehudah¦205877 \add (Judah)\add*.
\v 2 He ruled from Yerushalem¦205882 for three years¦205880. (His mother¦205884 was Uriel's¦205888 daughter¦205886 Mikayah from Giveah.)
\p \add ≈However\add* war \add started\add* between Aviyah and Yaraveam.
\p
\v 3 Aviyah \add ≈launched the attack\add* with four-hundred thousand \add ≈strong warriors\add*, and Yaraveam drew up in formation¦205915 against him with eight-hundred thousand \add ≈strong warriors\add* in his army.
\p
\v 4 Aviyah \add ≈stood on the top of\add* Mt. Tsemarayim in the Efrayim hill-country and \add ≈shouted\add*, “Yaraveam and all Yisrael, listen¦205936 to me.
\v 5 \add ≈Don't you¦205943 all understand\add* that Yisrael's God¦205948 Yahweh¦205946 \add ≈made a formal agreement\add* that the kingdom of Yisrael was given¦205950 forever¦205956 to David¦205952 and¦205958 his descendants?
\v 6 \add ≈But\add* Nevat's son Yaraveam, who was a servant¦205968 of David's¦205972 son Shelomoh, \add ≈took action\add* and rebelled¦205973 against his master¦205976,
\v 7 and \add ≈a bunch of wicked good-for-nothings\add* gathered¦205978 around \add @Yaraveam\add* and \add ≈created a force\add* against¦205999 Shelomoh's son, Rehaveam, when Rehaveam was \add ≈still an inexperienced¦205994, young¦205993 man¦205993 and couldn't stand up to\add* them.
\v 8 \add ≈So¦206001\add* now you're all saying¦206004 that you'll \add ≈stand against\add* the kingdom¦206007 \add ≈that Yahweh¦206008 established through\add* David's¦206011 descendants¦206010. \add ≈There are certainly many of you, and you have\add* the gold¦206017 calves¦206016 that Yaraveam made as gods¦206022 for you all.
\v 9 Didn't you all drive¦206025 out the Levites¦206034, as well as Yahweh's priests who were Aharon's descendants¦206032? Then you all \add ≈appointed\add* for yourselves ‘priests’ like they have in \add other\add* countries, so that anyone¦206046 who comes¦206042 to consecrate¦206043 himself by bringing a young bull¦206045 from the herd and seven¦206050 rams can become a ‘priest’ of your non-gods.
\p
\v 10 “\add ≈But\add* as for us, Yahweh is our¦206059 God¦206059 and we haven't abandoned¦206061 him¦206061. Our priests¦206062 who minister to Yahweh are Aharon's descendants¦206065, and the Levites¦206067 \add ≈assist them\add*.
\v 11 \add ≈Every morning and every evening\add*, they sacrifice burnt¦206072 offerings¦206070 to Yahweh, and spiced incense¦206079. There's \add sacred\add* bread¦206083 on the \add ≈display\add* table¦206086, and the lamps in the gold¦206089 lampstand give light¦206091 every evening because we are following the instructions of our God¦206102 Yahweh, \add ≈but\add* you all have abandoned¦206104 him.
\v 12 \add ≈So¦206107 listen!\add* God¦206125 is \add ≈guiding us\add* and his priests¦206112 will blast¦206114 their trumpets¦206113 to sound¦206115 against you all. \add ≡Listen\add* you Israelis¦206117: don't¦206119 fight against Yahweh¦206124, the god¦206125 of your ancestors¦206127, because you won't¦206119 succeed¦206131.”
\p
\v 13 \add ≈But¦206133 meanwhile,\add* Yaraveam had \add ≈sent\add* \add some men\add* around to ambush them from behind, so they¦206140 were \add both\add* in front¦206141 of \add the army from\add* Yehudah¦206142 and in ambush behind them.
\p
\v 14 When \add the warriors from\add* Yehudah¦206147 turned¦206146, wow, \add ≈they realised that they were being attacked from in front and from\add* behind¦206152. They \add ≈called\add* out to Yahweh¦206154 \add for help\add* \add ≈while\add* the priests¦206155 blew their trumpets¦206156.
\v 15 Then¦206160 the men from Yehudah \add ≈shouted¦206160 a loud battle cry\add* and God¦206167 defeated¦206168 Yaraveam and all Yisrael \add ≈in front¦206175 of\add* Aviyah and Yehudah.
\v 16 Yisrael's \add ≈soldiers\add* fled away from Yehudah's¦206184 \add army\add*, and God¦206186 \add ≈enabled Yehudah to defeat them\add*.
\v 17 Aviyah and his \add ≈men thrashed them badly\add*, and \add some\add* five-hundred thousand¦206201 of their chosen¦206203 \add ≈warriors were killed\add*.
\v 18 \add ≈So¦206205\add* the Israelis¦206208 were subdued¦206205 at that time, and the people from Yehudah¦206213 were victorious¦206211 because they \add ≈trusted in\add* Yahweh¦206218, the god¦206219 of their¦206220 ancestors¦206220.
\p
\v 19 Aviyah chased after¦206224 Yaraveam and they captured the cities¦206228 of Beyt-El, Yeshanah¦206239, and Efron¦206245 and the surrounding villages from \add @Yisrael\add*.
\v 20 Yaraveam \add ≈never regained military strength¦206252\add* during Aviyah's \add ≈reign\add*, and \add after a time\add* Yahweh¦206259 struck¦206258 him \add with sickness\add* and he died¦206260.
\p
\v 21 \add ≈Meanwhile,\add* Aviyah \add ≈became more powerful\add*. He took¦206265 fourteen wives¦206268 for himself, and had twenty-two sons¦206274 and sixteen daughters¦206277.
\v 22 The rest of \add ≈what Aviyah did, including his sayings and his behaviour, was written¦206285 down by\add* the prophet¦206287 Iddo¦206288.
