\mt2 Paul's letter to the believers in
\mt1 Ephesus
\is1 Introduction
\is2 The author
\ip This \bk Letter to the believers in Ephesus\bk* was written by Paul from prison in Rome.
\is2 This letter
\ip This letter wasn't just written for the assembly of believers there in Ephesus, but also for other assemblies of believers.
\ip Paul's main theme is about God's plan that ‘at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven or here on earth, for the messiah’ (1:10).
\ip In the first part of letter, he wrote about unity. Paul carefully explained about how God the father chooses his people, about forgiving and saving them from their sins through his son, Yeshua the messiah.
\ip In the second part of letter, Paul urges the reader that the believers need to be united in the messiah by means of their unity with each other.
\ip Paul uses many allegories about the unity of people with God via the messiah: the believers are the body of the messiah, he is the head; it's like a house, with the messiah as the foundation stone; the believers are also like a bride with the messiah as the groom.
\ip It's also explained here about the correct behaviour for couples, of parents and children, and for slaves and masters. Then in concluding his letter, it's explained about the armour that's given to believers for them to use to stand against Satan's attacks.
\ip It should be noted here that this letter, like most of the scriptures, was dictated to a scribe (See 2 Thess 3:17), so it was an oral letter, quite different from our modern letters which we edit with word-processing software, adding a word back in a previous sentence, combining two short sentences, or breaking an over-long sentence. Oral letters tend to contain a lot of \it run-on sentences\it* where the thoughts keep flowing without a break, thus 1:3-14 is considered by most Greek experts to be one long sentence (like this one is 😀), however for us as readers, a sentence with some two hundred words is very difficult for us to absorb, hence this \em Reader's Version\em* breaks that single Greek sentence into a number of smaller sentences, in fact, this kind of adjustment is regularly done throughout the Bible by all major English translations in order to make them easier for us to read, but the disadvantage is that we can sometimes lose whatever the connection was between the consecutive thoughts. The \em OET\em* tries to be more transparent about such adjustments by placing the \em Literal Version\em* right beside this text so that the serious student can compare the two.

\v 3 We praise \nd God¦128988\nd*, the father¦128990 of our \nd master¦128992 Yeshua¦128996\nd* the messiah.\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Verses 3-14 seem to be just one long, rambling sentence in the Greek, and it's not totally clear what each part means, or how they all connect logically together in sequence. We have split it into smaller sentence chunks to try to help our readers extract some meaning out of it.\f* He is the one who's blessed us with every¦129002 spiritual¦129004 blessing in heavenly¦129007 places—blessings that come from the messiah.
\v 4 He chose¦129011 us to follow him even before¦129015 the creation of the world¦129017, so that we could become pure¦129020 and blameless¦129022 in front¦129023 of him. Because of his¦129023 love¦129026
\v 5 he decided in advance to adopt¦129030 us as his¦129042 children through¦129031 \nd Yeshua¦129033\nd* the \nd messiah¦129034\nd*. His¦129042 decision gave him great pleasure¦129039
\v 6 and now he's praised¦129044 for the greatness of his¦129048 grace¦129047 which¦129051 favoured¦129052 us, as the one he loved¦129056
\v 7 \x + \xo 1:7: \xt Col 1:14.\x*redeemed us by means of his blood¦129065 and forgave our sins. It was from the riches¦129074 of his grace¦129078
\v 8 that was poured onto us that we gain wisdom¦129086 and¦129087 understanding¦129088
\v 9 as he revealed the mystery¦129092 of his will to us according¦129104 to his great pleasure¦129106 as he himself planned.
\v 10 He planned for the orchestration of the times¦129119, and at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven¦129131 or here on earth¦129136, for the \nd messiah¦129125\nd*
\v 11 and we¦129142 also have been assigned an inheritance¦129142 in him¦129155. This was also predetermined¦129143 according to God's plan and the decisions of his¦129155 will
\v 12 so that we, the ones who first put our trust in the \nd messiah¦129169\nd*, would praise¦129161 his¦129164 greatness.
\v 13 And you all also, after hearing the message of truth¦129179, the good message about being saved, were confirmed by receiving the \nd spirit¦129192\nd* of pure¦129196 promise¦129194 after you believed¦129188.
\v 14 This spirit is the deposit¦129200 on our¦129203 inheritance¦129202 until we procure¦129207 the freedom which has been bought for us, leading us to praise¦129209 God's greatness.

\v 15 Because¦129213 of that, when I heard¦129216 about your faith¦129220 in the \nd master¦129223 Yeshua¦129225\nd* and¦129226 your \add acceptance\add* of all the pure¦129233 believers,
\v 16 I don't¦129234 stop giving¦129236 thanks¦129236 for all of you, mentioning¦129239 you in my¦129245 prayers¦129244,
\v 17 asking the \nd God¦129248\nd* of our¦129251 \nd master¦129250 Yeshua¦129253\nd* the \nd messiah¦129254\nd* to give¦129259 you¦129261 spiritual¦129262 wisdom¦129263 and¦129264 to reveal the knowledge¦129267 about him¦129268.
\v 18 I ask that your¦129275 inner thoughts will be enlightened¦129269 so that you all will know the expectation of what he's calling¦129286 you to—the riches¦129291 of the greatness of his¦129287 inheritance¦129295 for the believers
\v 19 and the exceeding greatness¦129307 of his power to \add help\add* us who believe¦129314, according¦129315 to the working¦129317 of the power of his strength¦129321.
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*He worked¦129325 this power in the \nd messiah¦129328\nd* when he brought him back to life and seated him in the place of honour in heavenly¦129346 places—
\v 21 giving him authority¦129352 over every law and government and powerful¦129355 groups and organisations, and over every earthly title, not only in the present age but also in the age to come.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Psa 8:6.\x*Everything in existence will be under¦129376 his¦129379 authority and God set him in charge of all matters concerning¦129384 the assembly¦129387,
\v 23 which¦129388 is his¦129392 body¦129391—the completeness of the messiah who completes everything.

\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1-5: \xt Col 2:13.\x*You all were dead¦129404 due to your¦129414 disobedience and¦129408 the \add path of\add* sinning
\v 2 that you once walked¦129418 along when you followed the trends of this world¦129423 which \add in turn\add* come from the ruler¦129427 of the invisible powers—he's the spirit¦129433 that works in the children of disobedience.
\v 3 In the past, we also lived like them inside our¦129457 fleshly lusts and then living out those desires and fantasies, and so we were children¦129469 \add deserving\add* strong anger¦129472 just like everyone else.
\p
\v 4 But \nd God¦129479\nd* was generous with his¦129488 mercy¦129483 because¦129484 of the great¦129486 love¦129487 that he loved¦129490 us with,
\v 5 so although we were dead¦129496 as a result of our disobedience, he make us alive¦129504 along with the \nd messiah¦129507\nd*. Yes, we have been saved¦129510 by \add God's\add* grace¦129508.
\v 6 And God lifted us up and sat¦129514 us together¦129514 with \nd Yeshua¦129521\nd* the \nd messiah¦129520\nd* in the heavenly¦129517 \add domains\add*
\v 7 so that for the ages to come, he could display¦129523 the overflowing riches¦129533 of his grace¦129536 through his kindness¦129539 to us via \nd Yeshua¦129545\nd* the \nd messiah¦129544\nd*.
\v 8 It's \add God's\add* grace that allows you all to be saved¦129550 through¦129551 faith¦129553. This grace doesn't come from you, but rather it's a gift¦129561 from God—
\v 9 it doesn't originate from your actions so no one can brag about it.
\v 10 We are God's workmanship¦129573 and he's created¦129574 us to do good¦129580 things by following \nd Yeshua¦129577\nd* the \nd messiah¦129576\nd*. God has already planned these things for us to do.
\s1 Jews and non-Jews can be united

\p
\v 11 Because of that, don't forget that you¦129595 all were once fleshly unbelievers (nicknamed ‘the uncircumcised¦129602 ones’ by circumcised¦129606 Jews who mark the bodies \add of their males\add* with human hands).
\v 12 At that time¦129614 you were separated from the citizens¦129620 of Israel¦129622 and were strangers¦129624 to the agreements involving \add God's\add* promise¦129628. You didn't¦129630 have any future hope as you lived in the world¦129636 without¦129616 \add knowing\add* God.
\p
\v 13 But now \add thanks to\add* \nd Yeshua¦129641\nd* the messiah, you¦129642 all who were once far \add from God\add* have become¦129648 close by means of the messiah's blood¦129652.
\v 14 He is \add the source\add* of peace¦129659 \add between Jews and non-Jews\add*, having broken¦129671 the dividing¦129668 wall that fenced¦129670 them apart and making the two into one. He took the hostility onto himself,
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Col 2:14.\x*having¦129684 declared the \add old \add* commands¦129681 to be now void so that Jews and non-Jews can now be peaceably¦129698 united.
\v 16 \x + \xo 2:16: \xt Col 1:20.\x*By \add his death\add* on the pole, any hostility is destroyed and¦129700 both groups now become just one body¦129707 in God's sight.
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Isa 57:19.\x*When the messiah came, he announced the good message¦129720: peace to you all who were far \add from God\add*, and peace also to the ones who were near,
\v 18 so now both groups have access¦129739 to the father¦129747 by means of one \nd spirit¦129744\nd* through¦129730 \add the work of\add* the messiah.

\v 19 As a result, you all are no longer¦129750 strangers¦129752 and foreigners, but fellow-citizens¦129757 of the believers and part of God's household¦129761
\v 20 which has been founded¦129767 on the teaching of the missionaries and¦129770 prophets¦129771. The cornerstone¦129773 of this building is \nd Yeshua¦129778\nd* the \nd messiah¦129777\nd*.
\v 21 He joins the entire building¦129783 together¦129784, growing¦129785 us all into a dedicated temple¦129787 for \nd Yahweh¦129790\nd*.
\v 22 You all are being¦129795 built¦129795 together¦129795 by following him, becoming a place¦129797 for God's \nd spirit¦129802\nd* to live in.

\v 1 That's the reason¦129805 that I, Paul¦129807, am a prisoner¦129809 \add due to my serving\add* \nd Yeshua¦129812\nd* the \nd messiah¦129811\nd* for you¦129814 non-Jews¦129816.
\v 2 Certainly you have heard¦129819 that God assigned me the task of passing on God's grace¦129823 to you.
\v 3 He revealed his incredible plan as I wrote¦129841 briefly previously¦129841
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4-6: \xt Col 1:26-27.\x*and which¦129846 you¦129847 are all able to read to understand¦129849 my¦129852 insight¦129851 into the incredible plan about the \nd messiah¦129857\nd*.
\v 5 This plan wasn't explained to humans in previous generations¦129861 but now God's \nd spirit¦129878\nd* has revealed¦129870 it to his¦129874 worthy missionaries and¦129875 prophets¦129876.
\v 6 Now non-Jews¦129881 can have the same inheritance and become members¦129884 of the same body and can share in the same promise¦129888 that was the positive message¦129896 of \nd Yeshua¦129893\nd* the \nd messiah¦129892\nd*.
\p
\v 7 I have become¦129899 a servant¦129900 of that message as a result of the gift¦129903 of God's grace¦129905 that was given¦129910 to me by means of the working¦129915 of his¦129918 power¦129917.
\v 8 Although I was the least¦129923 of the ones dedicated to this message, I was given¦129927 the grace¦129929 to preach¦129934 this positive message to the non-Jews¦129933, to tell them about the endless riches¦129939 of the \nd messiah¦129941\nd*
\v 9 and¦129942 to enlighten¦129943 everyone about the assignment of God's incredible plan. God, the one who created¦129962 everything, hid this plan away over the ages
\v 10 so that the wide-ranging wisdom¦129982 of \nd God¦129984\nd* could be revealed now through¦129977 the church to the rulers¦129970 and¦129971 authorities¦129973 in the heavenly¦129976 realms¦129976.
\v 11 God did this according¦129985 to his plan for the ages which¦129989 he established¦129990 in our¦129998 \nd master¦129997 Yeshua¦129995\nd* the \nd messiah¦129994\nd*.
\v 12 It's through our faith¦130011 in Yeshua that we¦130001 can have boldness¦130003 and¦130004 confident¦130008 access¦130006 \add to God\add*.
\v 13 Because of that, I'm asking you not to become discouraged over my¦130021 current difficulties as I \add serve\add* you all, in fact you are honoured by them.

\p
\v 14 That's why I'm kneeling to \add ask\add* the father¦130038
\v 15 (the one that every¦130046 father in the heavens¦130049 and¦130050 on earth¦130052 is named¦130053 after)
\v 16 that he would cause you to be strengthened¦130067 inside¦130074 your minds by the power¦130066 of his \nd spirit¦130070\nd* and from the riches¦130061 of his greatness.
\v 17 Through \add your\add* faith¦130081, the \nd messiah¦130078\nd* can live in your hearts¦130084 so that love¦130087 will become your root and¦130089 foundation
\v 18 so that just like the dedicated ones, you¦130092 all will also be strong enough to understand the width and length¦130104 and height¦130106 and depth¦130109 of
\v 19 the \nd messiah's¦130120\nd* love, and to know¦130111 that having this love exceeds having knowledge¦130117 so that you all can be filled¦130122 with God's completeness.
\p
\v 20-21 Now we offer praise to \add God\add* in the church and for all the generations to come and to Yeshua the messiah—\add God\add* who, through the power¦130143 that works in us, is able to do far more than we can ask for or even understand¦130140. May it be so.

\v 6 one \nd God¦130228\nd* and father¦130230 of all who is over all and through¦130236 all and in all.
\p
\v 7 Yet each one of us has been given¦130248 a measure¦130253 of grace¦130250 as a gift¦130255 from the \nd messiah¦130257\nd*,
\v 8 just as it was written,
\q1 “When he ascended to heaven,
\q2 he eliminated captivity¦130265

\m
\v 9 Of course, he couldn't ascend if he hadn't first descended down to earth¦130289.
\v 10 So the one who descended is the very one who also ascended above¦130297 all the heavens¦130300 so that he could fill¦130302 all locations.
\v 11 Then¦130305 he gave¦130307 some as missionaries, some as prophets¦130314, some as announcers of the good¦130317 message¦130317, some as pastors and teachers¦130322
\v 12 so as to complete¦130325 the dedicated ones for the work¦130330 of service¦130330—for building¦130332 the body¦130334 of the \nd messiah¦130336\nd*
\v 13 until¦130337 we¦130338 can reach the unity of our faith¦130345 and¦130346 of our knowledge¦130348 about God's son—becoming mature¦130355 people measured¦130357 against the stature¦130358 of the fullness¦130360 of the \nd messiah¦130362\nd*.

\v 15 Instead, by lovingly speaking the truth¦130393, we¦130397 will grow up into every aspect of him¦130399—the \nd messiah¦130409\nd* who is the head

\p
\v 17 So¦130446 I'll say this with \nd Yahweh's¦130451\nd* direction: you¦130453 all are no longer¦130452 to walk¦130454 like \add unbelieving\add* pagans¦130459 who \add trust\add* in their¦130465 own futile thinking.
\v 18 Their¦130488 minds have been darkened¦130466 because their ignorance¦130478 has drawn them away from the life¦130473 of \nd God¦130475\nd* due to the hardening¦130485 of their hearts¦130487.
\v 19 They stopped caring \add about what's right and wrong\add*, and then greedily¦130501 indulged themselves¦130491 in their own impure¦130498 lusts.
\p
\v 20 But you¦130502 all didn't¦130504 learn¦130506 that about the \nd messiah¦130508\nd*.
\v 21 If you had heard him and listened to his teaching, you would have heard the truth¦130519 from \nd Yeshua¦130522\nd*:
\v 22 \x + \xo 4:22: \xt Col 3:9.\x*that you reject the former conduct¦130530 of the old corrupted¦130535 you, those seductive¦130540 desires¦130538,

\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25: \xt Zech 8:16.\x*So¦130568 steer clear of lies—always speak¦130572 the truth¦130573 to those around you because¦130582 we¦130584 are members¦130587 of each other.
\v 26 \x + \xo 4:26: \xt Psa 4:4 (LXX).\x*Even when you're angry, don't sin, and¦130589 don't carry your¦130599 anger¦130598 through to the next day—
\v 27 don't¦130601 let the devil¦130605 get his foot in.
\v 28 If you've been stealing, then stop it. Instead you should¦130609 be a hard worker, doing good¦130620 things with your hands¦130618, so that you'll \add earn\add* enough to be able to help those who are in need.
\v 29 Don't let any bad¦130630 talk come out of your¦130634 mouths¦130633, but¦130637 rather words that are helpful to encourage others and to show grace¦130647 to them.
\v 30 And don't¦130651 sadden God's holy \nd spirit¦130654\nd*, because he is the one who recorded your names for the day¦130663 when the price will be paid to buy you all back.
\v 31 So get rid of all bitterness¦130666, and rage¦130668 and severe¦130670 anger¦130670, uproars and slander¦130674, and any kind of malice¦130682.
\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32: \xt Col 3:13.\x*Instead, be kind to each other, tender-hearted¦130688, forgiving each other just like \nd God¦130694\nd* forgave¦130697 you¦130699 all through \add the work of\add* the \nd messiah¦130696\nd*.

\v 1 So¦130701 imitate \nd God¦130704\nd* like valued children¦130706 \add would imitate their father\add*
\v 2 \x + \xo 5:2: \xt Exo 29:18; Psa 40:6.\x*and immerse yourselves in love¦130711 just as the \nd messiah¦130715\nd* loves you¦130717 all and allowed himself¦130721 to suffer for us as an offering¦130725 and sacrifice¦130729 which is like a pleasant fragrance¦130735 to \nd God¦130732\nd*.
\rem /s1 Renounce Pagan Ways
\p
\v 3 It's fitting¦130749 for dedicated \add believers\add* to not even entertain thoughts of sexual¦130736 immorality¦130736 or impurity¦130740 or greed¦130743.
\v 4 Nor is dirty or foolish¦130756 talk¦130756 or crude¦130759 joking¦130759 fitting¦130764, but¦130765 rather¦130766 thankfulness¦130767.
\v 5 You should realise that \nd anyone¦130792\nd* who is sexually¦130775 immoral¦130775 or impure or is a covetous¦130779 or idolatrous¦130783 person won't¦130784 have an inheritance¦130786 in the kingdom¦130790 of the \nd messiah¦130792\nd* and¦130793 of \nd God¦130794\nd*.
\p
\v 6 Don't let anyone¦130795 seduce¦130797 you¦130796 with empty¦130799 talk, because¦130801 this is exactly what will induce God's strong anger¦130806 on those who're disobedient.
\v 7 So¦130816 don't¦130815 get caught up with them
\v 8 because¦130821 you yourselves were once in the darkness¦130823 but now that you are in \nd Yahweh's¦130828\nd* light, you should behave like children¦130830 of light.
\v 9 The results of this light¦130837 should be goodness¦130841 and doing what is right¦130843 and being honest
\v 10 as you \add aim\add* to please¦130849 \nd Yahweh¦130851\nd*.
\v 11 Don't join in with the works¦130856 of darkness¦130860 which don't¦130853 lead to positive results, but¦130862 instead you all should expose them
\v 12 because the things that unbelievers do in secret¦130868 are disgraceful to even talk about.
\v 13 But everything¦130884 will \add eventually\add* have the light shone on it and all these things will then be exposed.
\v 14 That's why it says:
\q1 You who're asleep get up,
\q1 You who're dead¦130900 come back to life,
\q2 The \nd messiah¦130905\nd* will shine \add his light\add* on you.
\rem /s1 Living by the Spirit's Power

\v 15 Because of that, take great care in exactly¦130910 how you're living. Don't live like fools, but¦130916 like wise people,
\v 16 \x + \xo 5:16: \xt Col 4:5.\x*making good use of your time¦130921, because¦130922 there's lot of evil¦130925 these days¦130924.
\v 17 So don't¦130929 be foolish¦130931, but¦130932 rather \add strive to\add* discover what \nd Yahweh¦130942\nd* wants for you.
\p
\v 18 And don't¦130945 get drunk¦130946 on alcohol because that's excessive. Instead, be filled¦130954 with \add God's\add* \nd spirit¦130957\nd*,
\v 19 \x + \xo 5:19-20: \xt Col 3:16-17.\x*sharing scriptures with each other and singing hymns¦130963 and songs¦130965 to praise¦130972 \nd Yahweh¦130980\nd*,

\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 5:22: \xt Col 3:18; 1Pe 3:1.\x*Wives should place themselves under their¦131007 own husbands¦131009, just like they're under the \nd master¦131014\nd*,
\v 23 because¦131015 the husband¦131017 is the leader of the wife¦131022 just like the \nd messiah¦131026\nd* is the head and saviour¦131034 of his body¦131036, the church.
\v 24 Wives should place themselves under their¦131050 husbands¦131052 in everything¦131054 just like the church should place itself under the \nd messiah¦131045\nd*.
\p
\v 25 \x + \xo 5:25: \xt Col 3:19; 1Pe 3:7.\x*You¦131056 husbands must love your¦131058 wives¦131059, just like the \nd messiah¦131064\nd* loved¦131065 the church and¦131068 gave¦131070 himself¦131069 \add completely\add* for it,
\v 26 so that he could separate the church \add from the world\add* and wash it clean¦131076 with the water¦131080 of the \add good\add* message¦131082
\v 27 in order to present¦131084 the splendid church to himself¦131087—without any stains¦131095 or wrinkles¦131097 or anything¦131099 like that—just pure¦131105 and¦131106 unblemished.
\v 28 So husbands¦131112 should love their wives¦131117 just like their own bodies¦131122—anyone who loves his wife¦131127 is loving himself.
\v 29 No one hates their own body¦131135, but¦131138 they feed and¦131140 look after it¦131142, just like the \nd messiah¦131146\nd* does for the church
\v 30 and we¦131152 are parts of his¦131155 body¦131154.
\v 31 \x + \xo 5:31: \xt Gen 2:24.\x*That's the reason why a man¦131168 leaves his father¦131170 and mother¦131174 and becomes joined¦131176 with his wife¦131180 and the two¦131186 of them become one unit.
\v 32 This is an amazing mystery¦131192 but¦131197 I'm talking¦131198 about the \nd messiah¦131200\nd* and¦131201 the church.
\v 33 But it applies to you all: each one of you should love your wife like yourself and the wife should respect her husband¦131225.

\v 11 Wear God's complete armour because¦131402 it will enable you¦131405 to stand¦131406 up against¦131407 the devil's¦131411 schemes¦131409.
\v 12 Our struggle isn't¦131413 against people, but against rulers, authorities¦131430, the powers of this world's¦131433 darkness¦131435, and the spiritual¦131441 forces of wickedness¦131443 in heavenly¦131446 places.
\v 13 Because¦131447 of that, make use of every piece of God's armour so that you'll be able to resist¦131457 those powers in the evil¦131462 day¦131460 and having¦131465 done everything, to remain standing¦131467.
