\mt2 Paul's letter to the believers in
\mt1 Ephesus
\is1 Introduction
\is2 The author
\ip This \bk Letter to the believers in Ephesus\bk* was written by Paul from prison in Rome.
\is2 This letter
\ip This letter wasn't just written for the assembly of believers there in Ephesus, but also for other assemblies of believers.
\ip Paul's main theme is about God's plan that ‘at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven or here on earth, for the messiah’ (1:10).
\ip In the first part of letter, he wrote about unity. Paul carefully explained about how God the father chooses his people, about forgiving and saving them from their sins through his son, Yeshua the messiah.
\ip In the second part of letter, Paul urges the reader that the believers need to be united in the messiah by means of their unity with each other.
\ip Paul uses many allegories about the unity of people with God via the messiah: the believers are the body of the messiah, he is the head; it's like a house, with the messiah as the foundation stone; the believers are also like a bride with the messiah as the groom.
\ip It's also explained here about the correct behaviour for couples, of parents and children, and for slaves and masters. Then in concluding his letter, it's explained about the armour that's given to believers for them to use to stand against Satan's attacks.
\ip It should be noted here that this letter, like most of the scriptures, was dictated to a scribe (See 2 Thess 3:17), so it was an oral letter, quite different from our modern letters which we edit with word-processing software, adding a word back in a previous sentence, combining two short sentences, or breaking an over-long sentence. Oral letters tend to contain a lot of \it run-on sentences\it* where the thoughts keep flowing without a break, thus 1:3-14 is considered by most Greek experts to be one long sentence (like this one is 😀), however for us as readers, a sentence with some two hundred words is very difficult for us to absorb, hence this \em Reader's Version\em* breaks that single Greek sentence into a number of smaller sentences, in fact, this kind of adjustment is regularly done throughout the Bible by all major English translations in order to make them easier for us to read, but the disadvantage is that we can sometimes lose whatever the connection was between the consecutive thoughts. The \em OET\em* tries to be more transparent about such adjustments by placing the \em Literal Version\em* right beside this text so that the serious student can compare the two.

\v 3 We praise \nd God¦128033\nd*, the father¦128035 of our \nd master¦128037 Yeshua\nd* the messiah.\f + \fr 1:3 \ft Verses 3-14 seem to be just one long, rambling sentence in the Greek, and it's not totally clear what each part means, or how they all connect logically together in sequence. We have split it into smaller sentence chunks to try to help our readers extract some meaning out of it.\f* He is the one who's blessed us with every¦128047 spiritual¦128049 blessing in heavenly¦128052 places—blessings that come from the messiah.
\v 4 He chose¦128056 us to follow him even before¦128060 the creation of the world¦128062, so that we could become pure¦128065 and blameless¦128067 in front¦128068 of him. Because of his¦128068 love¦128071
\v 5 he decided in advance to adopt¦128075 us as his¦128087 children through¦128076 \nd Yeshua¦128078\nd* the \nd messiah¦128079\nd*. His¦128087 decision gave him great pleasure¦128084
\v 6 and now he's praised¦128089 for the greatness of his¦128093 grace¦128092 which¦128096 favoured¦128097 us, as the one he loved¦128101
\v 7 \x + \xo 1:7: \xt Col 1:14.\x*redeemed us by means of his blood¦128110 and forgave our sins. It was from the riches¦128119 of his grace¦128123
\v 8 that was poured onto us that we gain wisdom¦128131 and¦128132 understanding¦128133
\v 9 as he revealed the mystery¦128137 of his will to us according¦128149 to his great pleasure¦128151 as he himself planned.
\v 10 He planned for the orchestration of the times¦128165, and at the right time he will gather everything, whether in heaven¦128177 or here on earth¦128182, for the \nd messiah¦128171\nd*
\v 11 and we¦128188 also have been assigned an inheritance¦128188 in him¦128201. This was also predetermined¦128189 according to God's plan and the decisions of his¦128201 will
\v 12 so that we, the ones who first put our trust in the \nd messiah¦128215\nd*, would praise¦128207 his¦128210 greatness.
\v 13 And you people also, after hearing the message of truth¦128225, the good message about being saved, were confirmed by receiving the \nd spirit¦128238\nd* of pure¦128242 promise¦128240 after you believed¦128234.
\v 14 This spirit is the deposit¦128246 on our¦128249 inheritance¦128248 until we procure¦128253 the freedom which has been bought for us, leading us to praise¦128255 God's greatness.

\v 15 Because¦128259 of that¦128275, and because I heard¦128262 about your faith¦128266 in the \nd master¦128269 Yeshua\nd* and your \add acceptance\add* of all the pure¦128279 believers,
\v 16 I don't¦128280 stop giving¦128282 thanks¦128282 for all of you, mentioning¦128285 you in my¦128291 prayers¦128290,
\v 17 asking the \nd God¦128294\nd* of our¦128297 \nd master¦128296 Yeshua¦128299\nd* the \nd messiah¦128300\nd* to give¦128305 you¦128307 spiritual¦128308 wisdom¦128309 and¦128310 to reveal the knowledge¦128313 about him¦128314.
\v 18 I ask that your¦128321 inner thoughts will be enlightened¦128315 so that you'll all know the expectation of what he's calling¦128332 you to—the riches¦128337 of the greatness of his¦128333 inheritance¦128341 for the believers
\v 19 and the exceeding greatness¦128353 of his power to \add help\add* us who believe¦128360, according¦128361 to the working¦128363 of the power of his strength¦128367.
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*He worked¦128371 this power in the \nd messiah¦128374\nd* when he brought him back to life and seated him in the place of honour in heavenly¦128392 places—
\v 21 giving him authority¦128398 over every law and government, and over every powerful¦128401 group and organisation, and over every earthly title, not only in the present age but also in the age to come.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Psa 8:6.\x*Everything in existence will be under¦128422 his¦128425 authority and God set him in charge of all matters concerning¦128430 the assembly¦128433,
\v 23 which¦128434 is his¦128438 body¦128437—the completeness of the messiah who completes everything.

\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 2:1-5: \xt Col 2:13.\x*You all were dead¦128450 due to your¦128460 disobedience and¦128454 the \add path of\add* sinning
\v 2 that you once walked¦128464 along when you followed the trends of this world¦128469 which \add in turn\add* come from the ruler¦128473 of the invisible powers—he's the spirit¦128479 that works in the children of disobedience.
\v 3 In the past, we also lived like them inside our¦128503 fleshly lusts and then living out those desires and fantasies, and so we were children¦128515 \add deserving\add* strong anger¦128518 just like everyone else.
\p
\v 4 But \nd God¦128526\nd* was generous with his¦128535 mercy¦128530 because¦128531 of the great¦128533 love¦128534 that¦128536 he loved¦128537 us with,
\v 5 so although we were dead¦128543 as a result of our disobedience, he make us alive¦128551 along with the \nd messiah¦128554\nd*. Yes, we have been saved¦128557 by \add God's\add* grace¦128555.
\v 6 And God lifted us up and sat¦128561 us together¦128561 with \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦128567\nd* in the heavenly¦128564 \add domains\add*
\v 7 so that¦128574 for the ages to come, he could display¦128570 the overflowing riches¦128580 of his grace¦128583 through his kindness¦128586 to us via \nd Yeshua¦128592\nd* the \nd messiah¦128591\nd*.
\v 8 It's \add God's\add* grace that allows you all to be saved¦128597 through¦128598 faith¦128600. This grace doesn't come from you, but rather it's a gift¦128608 from God—
\v 9 it doesn't originate from your actions so no one can brag about it.
\v 10 We are God's workmanship¦128620 and he's created¦128621 us to do good¦128627 things by following \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦128623\nd*. God has already planned these things for us to do.
\s1 Jews and non-Jews can be united
\rem /s1 One in Christ
\rem /s1 Oneness and Peace in Christ
\p
\v 11 Because of that, don't forget that you¦128642 all were once fleshly unbelievers (nicknamed ‘the uncircumcised¦128649 ones’ by circumcised¦128653 Jews who mark the bodies \add of their males\add* with human hands).
\v 12 At that time¦128661 you were separated from the citizens¦128667 of Yisrael \add (Israel¦128669)\add* and were strangers¦128671 to the agreements involving \add God's\add* promise¦128675. You didn't¦128677 have any future hope as you lived in the world¦128683 without¦128663 \add knowing\add* God.
\p
\v 13 But now \add thanks to\add* \nd Yeshua\nd* the messiah, you¦128689 all who were once far \add from God\add* have become¦128695 close by means of the messiah's blood¦128699.
\v 14 He is \add the source\add* of peace¦128706 \add between Jews and non-Jews\add*, having broken¦128718 the dividing¦128715 wall that¦128710 fenced¦128717 them apart and making the two into one. He took the hostility onto himself,
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Col 2:14.\x*having¦128731 declared the \add old \add* commands¦128728 to be now void so that Jews and non-Jews can now be peaceably¦128745 united.
\v 16 \x + \xo 2:16: \xt Col 1:20.\x*By \add his death\add* on the pole, any hostility is destroyed and¦128747 both groups now become just one body¦128754 in God's sight.
\v 17 \x + \xo 2:17: \xt Isa 57:19.\x*When the messiah came, he announced the good message¦128767: peace to you all who were far \add from God\add*, and peace also to the ones who were near,
\v 18 so now both groups have access¦128786 to the father¦128794 by means of one \nd spirit¦128791\nd* through¦128777 \add the work of\add* the messiah.

\p
\v 19 As a result, you all are no longer¦128797 strangers¦128799 and foreigners, but fellow-citizens of the believers and part of God's household¦128808
\v 20 which has been founded¦128814 on the teaching of the missionaries and¦128817 prophets¦128818. The cornerstone¦128820 of this building is \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦128824\nd*.
\v 21 He joins the entire building¦128830 together¦128831, growing¦128832 us all into a dedicated temple¦128834 for \nd Yahweh¦128837\nd*.
\v 22 You all are being¦128842 built¦128842 together¦128842 by following him, becoming a place¦128844 for God's \nd spirit¦128849\nd* to live in.

\v 1 That's the reason¦128852 that I, Paul¦128854, am a prisoner¦128856 \add due to my serving\add* \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦128858\nd* for you¦128861 non-Jews.
\v 2 Certainly you have heard¦128866 that¦128874 God assigned me the task of passing on God's grace¦128870 to you.
\v 3 He revealed his incredible plan as I wrote¦128888 briefly previously¦128888
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4-6: \xt Col 1:26-27.\x*and which¦128893 you¦128894 are all able to read to understand¦128896 my¦128899 insight¦128898 into the incredible plan about the \nd messiah¦128904\nd*.
\v 5 This plan wasn't explained to humans in previous generations¦128908 but now God's \nd spirit¦128925\nd* has revealed¦128917 it to his¦128921 worthy missionaries and¦128922 prophets¦128923.
\v 6 Now non-Jews can have the same inheritance and become members¦128931 of the same body and can share in the same promise¦128935 that was the positive message¦128943 of \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦128939\nd*.
\p
\v 7 I have become¦128946 a servant¦128947 of that message as a result of the gift¦128950 of God's grace¦128952 that was given¦128957 to me by means of the working¦128962 of his¦128965 power¦128964.
\v 8 Although I was the least¦128970 of the ones dedicated to this message, I was given¦128974 the grace¦128976 to preach¦128981 this positive message to the non-Jews, to tell them about the endless riches¦128986 of the \nd messiah¦128988\nd*
\v 9 and¦128989 to enlighten¦128990 everyone about the assignment of God's incredible plan. God, the one who created¦129009 everything, hid this plan away over the ages
\v 10 so that the wide-ranging wisdom¦129029 of \nd God¦129031\nd* could be revealed now through¦129024 the church to the rulers¦129017 and¦129018 authorities¦129020 in the heavenly¦129023 realms¦129023.
\v 11 God did this according¦129032 to his plan for the ages which¦129036 he established¦129037 in our¦129045 \nd master¦129044 Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah¦129041\nd*.
\v 12 It's through our faith¦129058 in Yeshua that we¦129048 can have boldness¦129050 and¦129051 confident¦129055 access¦129053 \add to God\add*.
\v 13 Because of that¦129072, I'm asking you not to become discouraged over my¦129068 current difficulties as I \add serve\add* you all, in fact you are honoured by them.

\p
\v 14 That's why I'm kneeling to \add ask\add* the father¦129085
\v 15 (the one that every¦129093 father in the heavens¦129096 and¦129097 on earth¦129099 is named¦129100 after)
\v 16 that he would cause you to be strengthened¦129114 inside¦129121 your minds by the power¦129113 of his \nd spirit¦129117\nd* and from the riches¦129108 of his greatness.
\v 17 Through \add your\add* faith¦129128, the \nd messiah¦129125\nd* can live in your hearts¦129131 so that love¦129134 will become your root and¦129136 foundation
\v 18 so that just like the dedicated ones, you¦129139 all will also be strong enough to understand the width and length¦129151 and height¦129153 and depth¦129156 of
\v 19 the \nd messiah's¦129167\nd* love, and to know¦129158 that having this love exceeds having knowledge¦129164 so that you all can be filled¦129169 with God's completeness.
\p
\v 20-21 Now we offer praise to \add God\add* in the church and for all the generations to come and to Yeshua the messiah—\add God\add* who, through the power¦129190 that¦129191 works in us, is able to do far more than we can ask for or even understand¦129187. May it be so.

\p
\v 7 Yet each one of us has been given¦129294 a measure¦129299 of grace¦129296 as a gift¦129301 from the \nd messiah¦129303\nd*,
\v 8 just as it was written,
\q1 “When he ascended to heaven,

\v 9 Of course, he couldn't ascend if he hadn't first descended down to earth¦129335.
\v 10 So the one who descended is the very one who also ascended above¦129343 all the heavens¦129346 so that he could fill¦129348 all locations.
\v 11 Then¦129351 he gave¦129353 some as missionaries, some as prophets¦129360, some as announcers of the good¦129363 message¦129363, some as pastors and¦129351 teachers¦129368
\v 12 so as to complete¦129371 the dedicated ones for the work¦129376 of service¦129376—for building¦129378 the body¦129380 of the \nd messiah¦129382\nd*
\v 13 until¦129383 we¦129384 can reach the unity of our faith¦129391 and¦129392 of our knowledge¦129394 about God's son—becoming mature¦129401 people measured¦129403 against the stature¦129404 of the fullness¦129406 of the \nd messiah¦129408\nd*.

\v 15 Instead, by lovingly speaking the truth¦129439, we¦129443 will grow up into every aspect of him¦129445—the \nd messiah¦129455\nd* who is the head

\v 17 So¦129492 I'll say this with \nd Yahweh's\nd* direction: you¦129499 all are no longer¦129498 to walk¦129500 like \add unbelieving\add* pagans¦129505 who \add trust\add* in their¦129511 own futile thinking.
\v 18 Their¦129534 minds have been darkened¦129512 because their ignorance¦129524 has drawn them away from the life¦129519 of \nd God¦129521\nd* due to the hardening¦129531 of their hearts¦129533.
\v 19 They stopped caring \add about what's right and wrong\add*, and then greedily¦129547 indulged themselves¦129537 in their own impure¦129544 lusts.
\p
\v 20 But you¦129548 all didn't¦129550 learn¦129552 that about the \nd messiah¦129554\nd*.
\v 21 If you had heard him and listened to his teaching, you would have heard the truth¦129565 from \nd Yeshua\nd*:
\v 22 \x + \xo 4:22: \xt Col 3:9.\x*that¦129580 you reject the former conduct¦129576 of the old corrupted¦129581 you, those seductive¦129586 desires¦129584,
