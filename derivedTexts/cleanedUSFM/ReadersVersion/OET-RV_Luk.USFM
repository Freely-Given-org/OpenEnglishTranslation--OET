\mt2 The first account by
\mt1 Luke
\mt2 being the account of Yeshua’s ministry
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua was written by Luke, one of the later followers of Yeshua. Luke was believed to be a medical doctor and although many have assumed him to be a Greek, there’s also a good case that he was Jewish. He was good friends with Paul and accompanied him several times as they travelled to various places to spread the good message about Yeshua the messiah. Luke was also the author of the account of the beginnings of the Christian church known commonly known as \bk Acts\bk*, and unlike most other Bibles, the \em Open English Translation\em* places these two successive accounts one after the other.
\is2 This account
\ip This account was written to Theophilus who is said to be an honoured person from Rome. He starts his account with the prophesied birth of Yohan-the-Immerser and then of Yeshua right through until he’s lifted into the clouds. Luke also explains how that Yeshua is the messiah promised by God to save Jews and all non-Jews who put their trust in him.
\ip It’s also told here in this document about Yeshua’s mercy towards troubled people and sinners, his healing din of many who were sick or possessed by demons, his bringing dead people back to life, and his teaching. Recurring themes here include God’s spirit, prayer, forgiveness of sins, the women who helped Yeshua with his work, and how believers should prepare for his return.

\s1 Introduction
\p
\v 1 Several people attempted to write an account about the events that we’re personally certain of
\v 2 as the ones who were eyewitnesses and hearers of these accounts from the beginning handed them over to us.
\v 3 So since we had followed all these events so carefully, it seemed like a good idea to write this account for you, honoured Theophilus,
\v 4 so that you could know the definite background behind what you were taught.
\s1 The messenger foretells the birth of Yohan-the-Immerser
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 1:5: \xt 1Ch 24:10.\x*It started with the priest Zechariah and his wife Elizabeth at the time when Herod was the king of Yudea. (Zechariah was in the priestly division of Abijah, and Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.)
\v 6 \nd God\nd* considered them both good and blameless as they obeyed his commandments and regulations.
\v 7 Elizabeth had never been able to have a child, so there was just the two of them as they were now getting older.
\p
\v 8 One time as he was taking his rostered turn to serve \nd God\nd* along with his division,
\v 9 he was chosen by lot (this was how the priests assigned tasks) to light the incense in the temple, and so he proceeded inside.
\v 10 A lot of people would be praying outside the temple at the time when the incense was burnt.
\v 11 At that moment, a messenger from God appeared to Zechariah, standing right there at the right of the incense altar.
\v 12 Zechariah got a big fright at seeing him there and started to tremble.
\v 13 But the messenger spoke, “Don’t be scared Zechariah, because your request has been listened to, and your wife Elizabeth will give birth to a son and you’ll name him Yohan.
\v 14 He’ll bring a lot of happiness to you and you’ll be proud of him—in fact many people will be glad.
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15: \xt Num 6:3.\x*He’ll be considered special in God’s eyes, but he won’t be allowed to drink wine or spirits. Even while he’s still in his mother’s womb, he’ll be filled with God’s \nd spirit\nd*.
\v 16 He will turn many children of Israel back to \nd Yahweh\nd*, their \nd God\nd*.
\v 17 \x + \xo 1:17: \xt Mal 4:5-6.\x*And he will go on ahead of God with the spirit and the power of Eliyah, to turn fathers back to loving their children and to turn career criminals towards the wisdom of godly people, to get the people ready for the \nd master\nd*.”
\p
\v 18 Zechariah asked the messenger, “How will I know if this is true. Because I’m an older man and my wife is also getting old.”
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 1:19: \xt Dan 8:16; 9:21.\x*Now the messenger rebuked him, “I am Gabriel who stood right in front of \nd God\nd* and was commanded to come here and talk to you, and to tell all of this to you.
\v 20 So hear this: Because you didn’t believe my message, you will be made silent and unable to speak until the day that all of these things happen, and they certainly will happen at the proper times.”
\p
\v 21 Meanwhile, the people outside were expecting Zechariah to come back out, and were wondering what could be holding him up there inside the temple.
\v 22 But when he did emerge, he wasn’t able to speak to them. They wondering if maybe he’d seen a vision in the temple, and he nodded to confirm this although he remained mute.
\v 23 And after he’d finished his rostered days in the temple, he returned home.
\p
\v 24 As time went on, Elizabeth became pregnant and secluded herself away for five months, saying,
\v 25 “The \nd master\nd*\f + \fr 1:25 \ft Clearly referring to \em Yahweh\em*. By this time in history, as a sign of respect the Jewish people had stopped saying God’s name aloud.\f* has done this for me. At this time he’s looked down at me and taken away the public shame of my being childless.”
\s1 God’s messenger comes to Maria
\p
\v 26 When Elizabeth was six months pregnant, \nd God\nd* sent his messenger Gabriel to \nd Nazareth\nd*, a city in the Galilee region.
\v 27 \x + \xo 1:27: \xt Mat 1:18.\x*Gabriel went to a young woman named Maria who was engaged to be married to Yosef, a descendant of \add King\add* David,
\v 28 and entering the room, spoke to her, “Hello there. The \nd master\nd* is with you and he’s chosen you to be honoured.”
\v 29 Maria was very puzzled by the statement and wondered what kind of greeting it could be
\v 30 as the messenger continued, “Don’t be scared, Maria, because you have found God’s favour
\v 31 \x + \xo 1:31: \xt Mat 1:21.\x*and listen, you will conceive a baby and go on to give birth to a son, and you should name him \nd Yeshua\nd*.
\v 32 \x + \xo 1:32-33: \xt 2Sam 7:12-13,16; Isa 9:7.\x*He will be very special and will be called the son of the highest one, and \nd God\nd* the \nd master\nd* will give him the throne of David, his ancestor.
\v 33 He will reign over Yacob’s descendants throughout the ages, and his kingdom will never end.”
\p
\v 34 “How would this work,” Maria asked the messenger, “because I’ve never slept with a guy?”
\p
\v 35 “The holy \nd spirit\nd* will come over you,” answered the messenger, “and the power of the highest one will overshadow you, and so the holy child that will be born will be called God’s son.
\v 36 Also, your relative Elizabeth has also conceived a son in her old age—the one who was called barren is now six months pregnant
\v 37 \x + \xo 1:37: \xt Gen 18:14.\x*because with \nd God\nd*, his statements always come to pass.”
\p
\v 38 “Look here,” said Maria, “I’m the \nd master’s\nd* servant girl. May everything you said come true.” Then the messenger left her.
\s1 Maria’s visit to Elizabeth
\p
\v 39 Several days later, Maria determined that she’d go to the town in the hills of Yudea
\v 40 where Zechariah and Elizabeth lived. She entered the house and greeted Elizabeth,
\v 41 and as soon as Elizabeth heard the greeting, her baby in her womb kicked, and she was filled with the holy \nd spirit\nd*
\v 42 and she called out loudly, “Out of \add all\add* women, you have been blessed and the baby in your womb has been blessed.
\v 43 How could this happen to me—that the mother of my \nd master\nd* would come and visit me!
\v 44 You see, as soon as I heard your greeting, the baby in my womb kicked with excitement,
\v 45 and the woman who believed that everything the \nd master\nd* told her will happen, she will be blessed.”
\s1 Maria’s song of praise
\p
\v 46 Maria said,
\q1 “My soul praises the \nd master\nd*,
\q1
\v 47 and my spirit is so happy about \nd God\nd*, my saviour,
\q1
\v 48 \x + \xo 1:48: \xt 1Sam 1:11.\x*because he noticed his humble servant girl.
\q1 Look now, all the future generations will consider that I was blessed
\q1
\v 49 because the powerful one treated me incredibly,
\q1 and his name is holy.
\q1
\v 50 He shows his mercy to multiple generations;
\q1 to those who honour him.
\q1
\v 51 His arm is powerful;
\q1 he scatters those who are proud in their hearts.
\q1
\v 52 \x + \xo 1:52: \xt Yob 5:11; 12:19.\x*He knocks kings off their thrones,
\q1 and praises those who’re humble.
\q1
\v 53 Those who’re hungry, he fills with good things,
\q1 but those who’re rich, he sends away empty handed.
\q1
\v 54 He took good care of his servant, Israel,
\q1 to be reminded of mercy
\q1
\v 55 \x + \xo 1:55: \xt Gen 17:7.\x*as he spoke to our ancestors,
\q1 to Abraham and his descendants,
\q1 at the right time.”
\p
\v 56 So Maria stayed with Elizabeth for about three months before returning back to her own home.
\s1 The birth of Yohan-the-Immerser
\p
\v 57 When Elizabeth’s nine months were up, she gave birth and produced a son
\v 58 and her neighbours and relatives heard that the \nd master\nd* had shown great mercy to her, and so they celebrated along with her.
\p
\v 59 \x + \xo 1:59: \xt Lev 12:3.\x*When the baby boy was eight days old, it was the time to circumcise him, and \add the relatives at the ceremony\add* started calling him Zacharias after the name of his father,
\v 60 but the baby’s mother spoke up and said, “No, he’s going to be named Yohan.”
\p
\v 61 “None of your relatives have that name,” they said
\v 62 and they signalled to the father to tell them what name he wanted for the baby.
\p
\v 63 So Zacharias requested a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is Yohan.” Everyone was amazed
\v 64 and then suddenly his mouth and tongue were freed and he was able to speak again and started praising \nd God\nd*.
\v 65 Everyone who lived nearby was a bit unnerved by all this, and the story about what happened was discussed \add in all the homes\add* around the hills
\v 66 and those who heard about it were thinking to themselves, “Who’s this young child going to turn out to be?”
\s1 Zacharias’ prophecy about Yohan
\p
\v 67 Then the boy’s father, Zacharias, became filled with the holy \nd spirit\nd* and prophesied,
\q1
\v 68 “Blessed is the \nd master\nd*, the \nd god\nd* of Israel,
\q1 because he visited us and made a way for his people to be freed from slavery.
\q1
\v 69 He brought us a voice that would lead to our salvation,
\q1 us citizens of \add the nation of King\add* David, his servant
\q1
\v 70 (as he spoke via the mouths of his holy prophets through the age\add s\add*).
\q1
\v 71 He saved us from our enemies,
\q1 and from the power of all the ones hating us,
\q1
\v 72 to show mercy to our ancestors
\q1 and to remind them of his holy agreement,
\q1
\v 73 that he had promised Abraham, our ancestor, that he would give us.
\q1
\v 74 He rescued us from the power of our enemies,
\q1 so we could serve him without fear,
\q1
\v 75 committed to obeying him
\q1 for the rest of our lives.
\q1
\v 76 \x + \xo 1:76: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*And you too my little child, will be called a prophet of the highest one—
\q1 going before the \nd master\nd* to prepare his paths,
\q1
\v 77 to give knowledge about salvation to his people
\q1 so their sins can be forgiven
\q1
\v 78 because \nd God\nd* has compassion on us and mercy.
\q1 Thus the light from heaven will visit us
\q1
\v 79 \x + \xo 1:79: \xt Isa 9:2.\x*to shine on those in darkness and sitting in the shadow of death;
\q1 to guide us onto the road of peace.”
\p
\v 80 The young boy grew and his spirit was also strengthened, and he lived in the wilderness until he started his ministry to \add the people of\add* Israel.
\c 2
\s1 Yeshua’s birth in Bethlehem
\r (Mat. 1:18-25)
\p
\v 1 At that time, Caesar Augustus sent a decree that everyone throughout the empire needed to register \add in a census\add*.
\v 2 (This census was conducted when Quirinius was the governor of Syria.)
\v 3 Everyone had to \add officially\add* register in the city where they were \add born\add*.
\p
\v 4 Because Yosef was a descendant of \add King\add* David, he left the town of \nd Nazareth\nd* in the Galilee \add region\add* and went down to David’s town of Bethlehem in Yudea
\v 5 to register along with Maria, his pregnant fiancée.
\v 6 While they were in Bethlehem, the time came for her to give birth
\v 7 and so Maria bore her first son and wrapped him in strips of cloth and slept him in an \add empty\add* feeding trough, because they had missed out on the guest room.
\s1 The shepherds and the messengers
\p
\v 8 In that same area, there were some shepherds staying out in the fields where they kept watch over their flocks at night.
\v 9 A messenger sent by the master approached them, and the master’s radiance shone around them, and they were very frightened.
\v 10 “Don’t be scared,” the messenger told them, “because I’m bringing you a good message that will bring great happiness to all people
\v 11 because a saviour for all people was born today in David’s town. He’s the \nd messiah\nd*—the \nd master\nd*—
\v 12 and this is how you’ll know him: you’ll find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and sleeping in a feeding trough.”
\p
\v 13 Then suddenly lots of heavenly soldiers joined the messenger, praising \nd God\nd* and saying,
\v 14 “Let all honour be given to \nd God\nd* in the highest, and peace on earth to all people along with good will.”
\p
\v 15 Then as the messengers left them and went \add up\add* into the sky, the shepherds said to each other, “Well, we’ll certainly go into Bethlehem so we can see what this was about that \nd Yahweh\nd* has let us know about.”
\p
\v 16 So they hurried \add into town\add* and asked around to find Maria and Yosef, and \add also\add* the baby sleeping in the feeding trough.
\v 17 When they met them, the explained what they’d been told about the young baby.
\v 18 Everyone who heard this was amazed at what the shepherds told them,
\v 19 but Maria treasured all of these messages in her heart and \add often\add* thought about them.
\v 20 Finally the shepherds returned \add back to their fields\add*—they were worshipping and praising \nd God\nd* for what they’d heard and how they’d seen it exactly like they’d been told.
\s1 The child is named Yeshua
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 2:21: a \xt Lev 12:3; \xo b \xt Luk 1:31.\x*When the baby was eight days old and hence the time for his circumcision, he was given the name \nd Yeshua\nd* as instructed by \add God’s\add* messenger even before he was conceived in the womb.
\s1 Yeshua is dedicated in the temple
\p
\v 22 Then when the time of the \add mother’s\add* purification was fulfilled as per Mosheh’s instructions, they took him down to Yerusalem to be dedicated to \nd Yahweh\nd*
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Exo 13:2,12.\x*to follow what is written in Yahweh’s law: Every firstborn male is set aside for Yahweh
\v 24 \x + \xo 2:22-24: \xt Lev 12:6-8.\x*and hence a sacrifice has to be made, which according to that law is a pair of turtledoves or a pair of young doves.
\p
\v 25 Now listen, there was a man named Simeon in Yerusalem and he was godly and committed, waiting for God to rescue Israel. He was \add full\add* of the holy \nd spirit\nd*
\v 26 and the \nd spirit\nd* had told him that he wouldn’t die without seeing Yahweh’s \nd messiah\nd*.
\v 27 He had come to the temple listening to the \nd spirit\nd* at just the same time as the parents brought in the baby \nd Yeshua\nd* in order to follow the rituals for new parents.
\v 28 Simeon took the baby into his arms and blessed \nd God\nd* and said,
\v 29 “Now, Yahweh, you can send your slave away in peace as you promised
\v 30 because I’ve set my eyes on your salvation
\v 31 which you have prepared in front of everyone:
\v 32 \x + \xo 2:32: \xt Isa 42:6; 49:6; 52:10.\x*a light so the non-Jews can understand, and the greatest gift from and for your people of Israel.”
\p
\v 33 The baby’s parents were amazed at the things being spoken about him,
\v 34 and Simeon blessed them and said to Maria, “Listen, this boy has been chosen to cause both the rise and the fall of many people in Israel, and \add sent as\add* a sign but one which many people will oppose.
\v 35 Also even as you experience incredible grief in the future, it will allow the thoughts of many hearts to be revealed.”
\p
\v 36 Also there, was a prophetess named Hanna (the daughter of Fanuel from the tribe of Asher). She was very elderly, having been married for seven years
\v 37 and then had been widowed for eighty-four years. She was always at the temple, serving night and day in prayer and fasting.
\v 38 She also approached the baby around the same time, and praised God and spoke about the boy to everyone in Yerusalem who was waiting for God to free them.
\s1 Their return home to Nazareth
\p
\v 39 \x + \xo 2:39: \xt Mat 2:23.\x*When they had done all the rituals according to Yahweh’s instructions, they returned to their home town of \nd Nazareth\nd* up in Galilee.
\v 40 The young boy grew and got stronger, and started showing amazing wisdom and it was clear that \nd God\nd* was blessing him.
\s1 Young Yeshua is found in the temple
\p
\v 41 \x + \xo 2:41: \xt Exo 12:1-27; Deu 16:1-8.\x*Every year Yeshua’s family would go down to Yerusalem for the Passover celebrations.
\v 42 One time when he was twelve years old, they went to celebrate the Passover there as usual,
\v 43 and when it was all over and they started on their return, the lad stayed there in Yerusalem but his parents weren’t aware of it.
\v 44 They thought he was with others in the group, but at the end of the day’s hiking when they looked for him among the relatives and acquaintances,
\v 45 they couldn’t find him, so they returned to Yerusalem to look for him.
\v 46 It was only after three days that they found him in the temple, sitting with the \add religious\add* teachers there—sometimes listening to them, and sometimes asking them questions.
\v 47 Everyone who had heard the conversations was amazed at his intelligence and knowledge.
\v 48 When his parents found him, they were astonished and his mother asked, “Son, how could you do this to us? Your father and I have been frantic looking for you!”
\p
\v 49 “Why did you all need to look for me?” he answered. “Didn’t you both know that it’s good for me to be in my father’s house?”
\v 50 But they didn’t really understand what he meant.
\p
\v 51 After that, he went back to \nd Nazareth\nd* with them and continued to be obedient to them,
\v 52 \x + \xo 2:52: \xt 1Sam 2:26; Prv 3:4.\x*and so \nd Yeshua\nd* continued to grow wiser and taller, and in favour with both \nd God\nd* and the people.
\c 3
\s1 Yohan-the-Immerser’s preaching
\r (Yhn 1:19-28; Mark 1:1-8; Mat. 3:1-12)
\p
\v 1 It was the fifteenth year of the rule of Caesar Tiberius when Pontius Pilate was the governor of Yudea and Herod was the ruler of the Galilean quarter. His brother Philip was the ruler of the Iturean quarter and of the region of Traconitis, and Lysanias was the ruler of the Abilene quarter.
\v 2 Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests \add in Yerusalem\add*, and this was the time when Yohan (son of Zechariah) began preaching God’s message in the wilderness.
\v 3 He went around all the areas surrounding the Yordan \add River\add*, telling \add the people\add* that they could get immersed \add in water\add* as a sign they were turning away from disobeying God and requesting forgiveness
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4-6: \xt Isa 40:3-5 (LXX).\x*just like the prophet Isayah had written:
\q1 ‘The voice shouting in the wilderness
\q1 prepare Yahweh’s road,
\q1 make his paths straight.
\q1
\v 5 Every valley will be filled up,
\q1 and every mountain and hill will be levelled off.
\q1 What’s crooked will be made straight,
\q1 and the rough roads will be made smooth.
\q1
\v 6 and everybody will see God’s salvation.’
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7: \xt Mat 12:34; 23:33.\x*Because of that, he was telling the crowds that went out there to be immersed by him, “Bunch of snakes! Who warned you all to flee from the severe anger that’s coming?
\v 8 \x + \xo 3:8: \xt Yhn 8:33.\x*So then start demonstrating the qualities that show you have actually turned from your disobedience. And don’t start by telling me that you’re descendants of Abraham, because I can tell you all that \nd God\nd* could make descendants out of these stones here.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9: \xt Mat 7:19.\x*The axe is already sitting at the base of the trees, so that every tree that doesn’t produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.”
\p
\v 10 “What should we do then,” the crowds asked him.
\p
\v 11 “If you’ve got two jackets, give one to someone who doesn’t have one,” he replied, “and similarly if you’ve got food.”
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 3:12: \xt Luk 7:29.\x*Even some tax-collectors came to be immersed, and they asked Yohan, “Teacher, what should we do?”
\p
\v 13 “Don’t collect any extra on top of what you’ve been told to collect,” he said.
\p
\v 14 “And what about us too,” some soldiers inquired.
\p “Don’t bully people or falsely accuse anyone,” Yohan answered, “and be content with your wages.”
\p
\v 15 The people were expecting that the \nd messiah\nd* might come \add to save them\add* and started wondering in their minds if maybe it was Yohan
\v 16 but he explained to them all, “I’ve been immersing you all in water, but there’s one coming who’s greater than me, in fact I’m not even worthy to unlace his sandals. He will immerse you all with the holy \nd spirit\nd* and with fire.
\v 17 He’ll hold the winnowing fork so he can clear out the threshing floor, gathering the wheat into his barn and burning up the chaff with a fire that never goes out.”
\p
\v 18 Yohan preached the good message to the people and also encouraged them to change for the better.
\v 19 \x + \xo 3:19-20: \xt Mrk 6:17-18; Mat 14:3-4.\x*But Herod who was the ruler of the \add Galilean\add* quarter had been scolded by Yohan about taking his brother Philip’s wife Herodias, and about many other evil things that he’d done,
\v 20 added to his evils when he locked Yohan up in prison.
\s1 Yeshua’s double baptism
\r (Mark 1:9-11; Mat. 3:13-17)
\p
\v 21 One day along with all the other people being immersed, \nd Yeshua\nd* had come and been immersed, and while he prayed, the sky opened up
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Gen 22:2; Psa 2:7; Isa 42:1; Mrk 1:11; Mat 3:17; Luk 9:35.\x*and the holy \nd spirit\nd* came down onto him in the bodily form of a dove, and a voice came from the sky, “You are my son that I love and take pleasure in.”
\s1 Yeshua’s ancestry back to God
\r (Mat. 1:1-17)
\p
\v 23 \nd Yeshua\nd* was about thirty when he started \add his ministry\add*. He was the son (as it was thought) of Yosef, son of Heli,
\v 24 the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melki, the son of Yannai, the son of Yosef,
\v 25 the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,

\s1 Yeshua is tested by the devil
\r (Mark 1:12-13; Mat. 4:1-11)
\p
\v 1 Then \nd Yeshua\nd*, full of the holy spirit, returned from the Yordan region and was led into the wilderness by the spirit
\v 2 where he was tested by the devil for forty days. He didn’t eat anything during that time, and was hungry at the end.
\p
\v 3 So the devil told him, “If you’re God’s son, just turn this stone into bread.”
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 4:4: \xt Deu 8:3.\x*“\wj It’s been written,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* replied, “\wj that people don’t live just on food.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 Then the devil brought him up \add to a high point\add* and in just a moment of time, showed him the vista of all the kingdoms of the world,
\v 6 and he said, “I’ll give you this entire domain and the status of these kingdoms because it’s been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want,
\v 7 so just bow down in front of me and it’ll all be yours.”
\p
\v 8 \x + \xo 4:8: \xt Deu 6:13.\x*“\wj It’s been written,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj that we should only bow down to \nd Yahweh\nd* our \nd God\nd* and only serve him.\wj*”
\p
\v 9 Then the devil led him to Yerusalem and they stood on the highest part of the temple, where he told him, “If you’re God’s son, throw yourself down from here,
\v 10 \x + \xo 4:10-11: \xt Psa 91:11-12.\x*because it’s written that God will command his messengers to guard you
\v 11 and they will carry you in their hands, so you won’t even hurt your foot on a stone.”
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12: \xt Deu 6:16.\x*“\wj It’s been written,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* responded, “\wj that we shouldn’t test \nd Yahweh\nd* our \nd God\nd*.\wj*”
\p
\v 13 So after completing every temptation, the devil withdrew from him for a time.
\s1 Yeshua begins his ministry
\r (Mark 1:14-15; Mat. 4:12-17)
\p
\v 14 So then \nd Yeshua\nd* returned to Galilee in the power of the \nd spirit\nd*, and the news about him spread into the surrounding region.
\v 15 He started teaching in the meeting halls and everyone said how good it was.
\s1 Yeshua isn’t appreciated in Nazareth
\r (Mark 6:1-6; Mat. 13:53-58)
\p
\v 16 When he got to \nd Nazareth\nd* where he grew up, he went into the meeting hall as usual on the Rest Day and stood up to do the reading.
\v 17 The scroll of the prophet Isayah was handed to him, and opening up the scroll, he found the place where it was written,
\q1
\v 18 \x + \xo 4:18-19: \xt Isa 61:1-2 (LXX).\x*“\wj Yahweh’s \nd spirit\nd* is on me,\wj*
\q1 \wj because he has chosen and equipped me\wj*
\q1 \wj to preach the good message to the poor.\wj*
\q1 \wj He has sent me out to proclaim freedom for captives\wj*
\q1 \wj and to restore sight to the blind,\wj*
\q1 \wj and for the oppressed to experience freedom.\wj*
\q1
\v 19 \wj He’s sent me to proclaim that this is the year that \nd Yahweh\nd* has chosen.\wj*”
\p
\v 20 Then after rolling up the scroll and giving it back to the attendant, he sat down \add to give his commentary\add* and every person in the room was studying him
\v 21 as he began to speak, “\wj Today this scripture that you’ve just heard has been fulfilled.\wj*”
\p
\v 22 Later everyone was telling others about him, and they were marvelling at his messages displaying \add God’s\add* grace, and they asked each other, “Isn’t this Yosef’s son \add from down the road\add*?”
\p
\v 23 Then Yeshua answered them, “\wj I’m sure you’ll all be telling me that parable about the doctor who needed to heal himself, because you’ll be wanting me to do here in my hometown what I did in Capernaum.\wj*
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Yhn 4:44.\x*\wj I can assure you all that no prophet is accepted by his own hometown.\wj*
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25: \xt 1Ki 17:1.\x*\wj There were certainly many widows in Israel in the days of Eliyah when \add God\add* stopped the rain for three and a half years and caused a terrible famine.\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 4:26: \xt 1Ki 17:8-16.\x*\wj But Eliyah wasn’t sent to any of them—rather he was sent to a \add foreign\add* widow in Zarephath in the Tsidon region.\wj*
\v 27 \x + \xo 4:27: \xt 2Ki 5:1-14.\x*“\wj Also there were many people in Israel with leprosy in the days of the prophet Elisha and none of them were healed, but only Naaman from Syria.\wj*”
\p
\v 28 By now everyone in the meeting hall that heard this was furious
\v 29 and they all stood up, planning to throw him out of the city. They led him to the edge of the hill that their town was built on, intending to throw him over the edge,
\v 30 but somehow he just moved through the middle of them and left.
\s1 The demon-possessed man
\r (Mark 1:21-28)
\p
\v 31 After that, Yeshua went to Capernaum, another town in Galilee, and taught in the meeting hall there on the Rest Days.
\v 32 \x + \xo 4:32: \xt Mat 7:28-29.\x*They were amazed at his teaching, because he presented his message with authority.
\v 33 One week there was a man at the meeting hall with a demon spirit and he yelled out,
\v 34 “Ha! What do we have in common with you, \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd Nazarene\nd*? Did you come here to destroy us? I know who you are—you’re the holy one from \nd God\nd*.”
\p
\v 35 \nd Yeshua\nd* rebuked the demon, saying, “\wj Be quiet! Now come out of him!\wj*” Then the demon threw the man to the floor right in the middle of them, and came out of him, and left him feeling perfectly fine.
\p
\v 36 This amazed everyone and they started asking each other, “What is this command that has such authority and power that he orders evil spirits around and they come out?”
\v 37 After that, the reports of what he’d done were passed around to every part of the surrounding region.
\s1 Yeshua heals many people
\r (Mark 1:29-34; Mat. 8:14-17)
\p
\v 38 After getting up and leaving the meeting hall, Yeshua went to Simon’s home where Simon’s mother-in-law had been struck with a high fever and they asked Yeshua about it.
\v 39 Going over to where she was lying, Yeshua rebuked the fever and it left her, and she stood up straight away and got them something to eat.
\p
\v 40 In the evening, anyone who had a relative with any kind of disease brought their sick relatives to Yeshua and he placed his hands on each one of them and healed them.
\v 41 Also demons came out from many people, yelling out, “You are God’s son.”
\p But he rebuked them and didn’t allow them to speak because they knew that he was the \nd messiah\nd*.
\s1 Yeshua’s preaching in Yudea
\r (Mark 1:35-39)
\p
\v 42 The next day, Yeshua went off to a quiet place, but the crowds were looking for him and followed after him and insisted that he didn’t leave them,
\v 43 but he told them, “\wj I also need to preach this good message about God’s kingdom in other towns, because that’s why I was sent here.\wj*”
\v 44 So then he went down to Yudea and preached in the meeting halls there.
\c 5
\s1 Yeshua’s power over creation
\r (Mark 1:16-20; Mat. 4:18-22)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 5:1-3: \xt Mrk 3:9-10; 4:1; Mat 13:1-2.\x*One time when the crowd was pressuring Yeshua that they wanted to hear God’s message as he stood by Lake Galilee,
\v 2 he saw two boats at the edge of the water, but the fishermen had left the boats so they could wash their nets.
\v 3 Yeshua hopped into one of the boats which turned out to be Simon’s, and asked him just to \add row\add* out a little way from the land. Then Yeshua sat there in the boat and taught the crowds from there.
\p
\v 4 Once he’d finished his speaking, he told Simon, “\wj Go out to the deeper parts and lower your nets to catch \add some fish\add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 5:5: \xt Yhn 21:3.\x*“Master,” Simon answered, “we worked all through the night and didn’t catch anything, but ok, I’ll do what you say and lower the nets.”
\v 6 \x + \xo 5:6: \xt Yhn 21:6.\x*When they lowered the nets, they \add quickly\add* netted a huge catch of fish, so much so that their nets began to rip
\v 7 and they \add had to\add* signal to their companions in the other boat to come and help. When they got there, they filled both boats \add with so many fish that the weight\add* began to sink them.
\v 8 When Simon Peter \add had a moment\add* to realise what had just happened, he knelt \add in the boat\add* in front of \nd Yeshua\nd* and said, “You must leave me, \nd master\nd*, because I’m just a sinful man.”
\p
\v 9 Peter and all those with him were stunned at the size of the catch.
\v 10 This included Yacob and Yohan (Zebedee’s sons) who were his \add fishing\add* partners.
\p
\v 11 When they got the boats up onto the shore, they left everything there and followed after Yeshua.
\s1 Yeshua heals a man with leprosy
\r (Mark 1:40-45; Mat. 8:1-4)
\p
\v 12 In one of the towns that they visited, a man covered in leprous \add lesions\add* lay face down in front of \nd Yeshua\nd* when he saw him, and implored him, “\nd Master\nd*, if you wanted you’d be able to heal me.”
\p
\v 13 Yeshua reached out his hand and touched him, saying, “I do want it. Be free from this.” Immediately the man was clear of leprosy.
\v 14 \x + \xo 5:14: \xt Lev 14:1-32.\x*“\wj Don’t tell others,\wj*” Yeshua instructed, “\wj but go directly to the priest with the offering commanded by Mosheh and show yourself to him \add for clearance\add* and as a testimony to them.\wj*”
\p
\v 15 However the news about Yeshua was spreading all around, and large crowds were gathering to listen to him and to be healed from their diseases,
\v 16 but then he would \add regularly\add* withdraw into the wilderness to pray.
\s1 A paralysed man is lowered through the roof
\r (Mark 2:1-12; Mat. 9:1-8)
\p
\v 17 Yeshua was teaching one day, and some from the Pharisee party and some religious teachers were sitting there \add listening\add*. They had come from villages all around Galilee and Yudea, and also from Yerusalem, and the power of \nd Yahweh\nd* was there enabling Yeshua to heal people.
\v 18 Then, look, some men turned up carrying a paralysed man on a stretcher, and they tried to bring him inside and place him in front of Yeshua
\v 19 but because of the crowd they couldn’t find a way in. So instead, they went \add up the stairs\add* to the \add flat\add* roof and removed some tiles in order to let the stretcher down right in front of \nd Yeshua\nd*.
\v 20 When he saw their faith, he said, “Man, your sins have been forgiven.”
\p
\v 21 “Who’s this guy who’s insulting God?” the teachers and Pharisees started to say among themselves. “Only \em God\em* is able to forgive sins.”
\p
\v 22 But \nd Yeshua\nd* knew what they were thinking and saying, and answered them, “\wj Why are you reasoning about this in your minds?\wj*
\v 23 \wj Which is easier to say: ‘Your sins have been forgiven,’ or ‘Stand up and walk’?\wj*
\v 24 \wj But I’ll demonstrate to you that humanity’s child \em does\em* have the authority to forgive sins here on earth.\wj*” Then he turned to the paralysed man and told him, “Listen to me. Stand up and pick up your stretcher, then go home.”
\p
\v 25 Immediately the man stood up, right there in front of them all, picked up what he’d been lying on, and headed off to his home praising \nd God\nd*.
\v 26 Everyone was astounded and they too praised \nd God\nd*. But there was also a feeling of fear and they said, “We’ve witnessed something out-of-the-normal today!”
\s1 Levi follows Yeshua and hosts a banquet
\r (Mark 2:13-17; Mat. 9:9-13)
\p
\v 27 Yeshua went outside after that and he saw a tax-collector named Levi sitting in his office and told him, “\wj Come and follow me.\wj*”
\v 28 So Levi left everything and went and followed Yeshua.
\p
\v 29 Then Levi prepared a large meal in his home for Yeshua, plus there were also a lot of tax-collectors and others who were sitting with them.
\v 30 \x + \xo 5:30: \xt Luk 15:1-2.\x*Some from the Pharisees party and religious teachers grumbled at Yeshua’s followers, complaining, “Why are you all eating and drinking with tax collectors and other low-life?”
\p
\v 31 But it was \nd Yeshua\nd* who answered, “\wj Healthy people don’t need a doctor—only those who’re sick.\wj*
\v 32 \wj I didn’t come to call those who’re ‘righteous’, but to call sinners to come and turn away from disobeying God.\wj*”
\s1 The question about fasting
\r (Mark 2:18-22; Mat. 9:14-17)
\p
\v 33 Then the religious leaders complained, “Yohan’s followers often fast and bring their needs to God, as do the Pharisees, but your followers are eating and drinking.”
\p
\v 34 “\wj You can’t make the groomsmen fast at a wedding,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* responded, “\wj not while the groom is with them.\wj*
\v 35 \wj But yes, there will be a future time when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they’ll fast.\wj*”
\p
\v 36 Then he went on to tell them this parable, “\wj No one repairs their old clothes by putting on a patch of new material. If they did, the new patch will likely tear off again, plus it wouldn’t look right anyway.\wj*
\v 37 \wj Similarly, no one puts new wine \add to mature\add* into old wineskins. If they did, the new wine would certainly burst the old wineskin and it would all pour out and the wineskin would be ruined as well.\wj*
\v 38 \wj New wine needs to be put into a new wineskin.\wj*
\v 39 \wj And no one who’s \add used to\add* the old \add ways\add* wants the new, because he’ll claim that the old is good \add enough\add*.\wj*”
\c 6
\s1 Master of the Rest Day
\r (Mark 2:23-28; Mat. 12:1-8)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 6:1: \xt Deu 23:25.\x*One Rest Day, Yeshua was walking through some fields of grain and his followers were plucking the heads of grain and rubbing them \add apart\add* in their hands, then chewing the grains.
\v 2 But some from the Pharisees party asked, “Why are you doing that? It’s prohibited \add to harvest\add* on a Rest Day.”
\p
\v 3 “\wj Haven’t you read about David,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj when him and his men were hungry and what they did?\wj*
\v 4 \x + \xo 6:4: \xt Lev 24:9.\x*“\wj He went into God’s temple and took the ‘bread of the presence’ and ate some and gave some to his men, even though it’s only priests that are allowed to eat that.\wj*”
\v 5 Then he added, “\wj Humanity’s child is the \nd master\nd* of the rest days.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua heals the deformed hand
\r (Mark 3:1-6; Mat. 12:9-14)
\p
\v 6 On a different Rest Day, Yeshua went into a meeting hall and was teaching \add the congregation\add*. There was a man there with a deformed right hand
\v 7 and the religious teachers and Pharisees were watching Yeshua closely to see if he might heal the man on the Rest Day so they’d have something to accuse him of.
\v 8 But he knew their plans and spoke to the man with the deformed hand, “\wj Stand up and come into the middle.\wj*” So the man got up and stood in front of them.
\v 9 “\wj I want to ask all of you,\wj*” said \nd Yeshua\nd*, “\wj whether or not it’s allowable to do good on the Rest Day, or only evil—to save life or to destroy it?\wj*”
\v 10 Turning \add slowly\add* and looking at them all, he then said to the man, “\wj Hold out your hand.\wj*” The man did it and his hand was healed,
\v 11 but the religious leaders were mad with anger and discussed among themselves about what they could do to \nd Yeshua\nd*.
\s1 Yeshua chooses twelve to be missionaries
\r (Mark 3:13-19; Mat. 10:1-4)
\p
\v 12 One day Yeshua climbed a hill to pray, and then he spent the night there praying to \nd God\nd*.
\v 13 In the morning, he called together his followers, and chose twelve of them that he then called ‘missionaries’:
\v 14 Simon (who he also named Peter) and his brother Andrew, Yacob and Yohan, Philip and Bartholomew,
\v 15 Matthew and Thomas, Jacob (Alphaeus’ son), Simon (the one known as a Zealot),
\v 16 Yudas (son of Yacob), and Yudas Iscariot (who eventually betrayed him).
\s1 The crowds want to touch Yeshua
\r (Mat. 4:23-25)
\p
\v 17 Then coming down the hill with them, Yeshua stood on a flat area along with a large crowd of his followers. There was also a large number of people from all around Yudea and Yerusalem and from the coastal areas of Tyre and Tsidon
\v 18 who came to hear what he had to say, as well as getting healed from their various diseases.
\v 19 All the people in the crowd wanted to touch him, because power would come out from him and he was healing everyone.
\s1 The blessed and the unblessed
\r (Mat. 5:1-12)
\p
\v 20 Then looking up at his followers, he said,
\q1 “\wj Blessed are the poor, because God’s kingdom is yours.\wj*
\q1
\v 21 \wj Blessed are those who don’t have enough to eat now, because you’ll all be satisfied.\wj*
\q1 \wj Blessed are those who are weeping now, because you’ll all be laughing.\wj*
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 6:22: \xt 1Pe 4:14.\x*\wj You’re all blessed when people hate you and snob you, and when they deride you and slander your reputations as evil, all on account of humanity’s child.\wj*
\v 23 \x + \xo 6:23: \xt 2Ch 36:16; Acts 7:52.\x*\wj Be happy at that time and dance with happiness, because you’ll have a large reward in heaven. Their ancestors did the same sorts of things to the prophets.\wj*
\q1
\v 24 \wj However it’s tragic for all you rich people, because you’ve already enjoyed all those comforts.\wj*
\q1
\v 25 \wj It’s tragic for all of you who are full now, because you’ll all be hungry.\wj*
\q1 \wj It’s tragic for all of you who are laughing now, because you’ll all be mourning and crying.\wj*
\q1
\v 26 \wj It’s tragic for you whenever all the people say they admire you, because their ancestors did the same to the false prophets.\wj*
\s1 Loving the unlovely
\r (Mat. 5:38-48; 7:12a)
\p
\v 27 “\wj But I’ll tell all of you who’re listening: Love your enemies and be kind to those who hate you.\wj*
\v 28 \wj Give a blessing to those who curse you and pray for those who mistreat you all.\wj*
\v 29 \wj When someone slaps you on the face, offer them the other side, and when someone forces you to hand over your coat, don’t resist if they want your shirt as well.\wj*
\v 30 \wj Give to everyone who asks you for something, and when someone takes your stuff, don’t go demanding it back.\wj*
\v 31 \x + \xo 6:31: \xt Mat 7:12.\x*\wj However you’d all like people to treat you, that’s how you should be treating them.\wj*
\p
\v 32 “\wj And if you only love those who love you, how good is that? Even those who disobey God love those who love them.\wj*
\v 33 \wj If you only do good things to people who’re good to you, how good is that? Even those who disobey God do that.\wj*
\v 34 \wj And if you only lend \add money\add* to people that you’re expecting to \add repay\add* you, how good is that? Even those who disobey God lend to others like them, knowing they’ll get their money back.\wj*
\v 35 \wj Instead, you all should love your enemies and do good and lend out even when you expect to get nothing back. Then your reward will be large and you’ll all be sons of the highest \add God\add* because he is good to ungrateful and evil \add people\add*.\wj*
\v 36 \wj You should be compassionate towards others, because your father is compassionate.\wj*
\s1 Don’t judge others
\r (Mat. 7:1-5)
\p
\v 37 “\wj Don’t judge others, then you definitely won’t be judged. Don’t condemn others, then you definitely won’t be condemned.\wj*
\v 38 \wj Give to others, and then you’ll be given to generously. The returned amount will be really packed in to the container and even overflowing, because however you measure things out for others, that’s how things will be measured out for you.\wj*”
\p
\v 39 \x + \xo 6:39: \xt Mat 15:14.\x*Then Yeshua told them a parable: “\wj Surely a blind person can’t be a guide for someone else who’s blind. Won’t both of them fall into a ditch?\wj*
\v 40 \x + \xo 6:40: \xt Yhn 13:16; 15:20; Mat 10:24-25.\x*\wj A trainee isn’t above their teacher, but can become like their teacher once they’re fully trained.\wj*
\p
\v 41 “\wj How come you notice the speck in someone else’s eye, yet don’t even notice the log that’s in your own eye?\wj*
\v 42 \wj How can you tell that person, ‘Hey, let me get that speck out of your eye,’ when you can’t even see the log in \em your\em* eye? You hypocrite, get the log out of your eye and then you’ll be able to see clearly so you can remove the speck in the other person’s eye.\wj*
\s1 The tree is recognised by its fruit
\r (Mat. 7:16-20; 12:33-35)
\p
\v 43 “\wj A good tree doesn’t produce bad fruit, and a bad tree doesn’t produce good fruit,\wj*
\v 44 \x + \xo 6:44: \xt Mat 12:33.\x*\wj but each tree is recognised by the fruit it produces. You don’t pick figs from thistles or pick grapes from thorn bushes.\wj*
\v 45 \x + \xo 6:45: \xt Mat 12:34.\x*\wj A good person produces good deeds as a result of all the good things inside them, and an evil person produces evil deeds as a result of the evil \add inside\add*, because what comes out of your mouth originates in your mind.\wj*
\s1 The two house-builders
\r (Mat. 7:24-27)
\p
\v 46 “\wj So why do you all call me ‘master, master,’ yet you don’t do what I say?\wj*
\v 47 \wj Everyone who comes to me and listens to my messages and puts them into practice, I’ll show you who that person is like:\wj*
\v 48 \wj That person is like a man building a house. He dug and drilled and laid a foundation on the rock, and then when there was a flood that dashed against that house, it didn’t shake it because it was built well.\wj*
\v 49 \wj But the person who listens and doesn’t put the message into practice is like a man that just built his house on the ground with no foundation, and when the flood dashed against it, the house immediately collapsed and bust into many pieces.\wj*”
\c 7
\s1 Yeshua heals the centurion’s slave
\r (Mat. 8:5-13)
\p
\v 1 After Yeshua had finished sharing those messages with the people, he entered \add the town of\add* Capernaum.
\v 2 A Roman army commander there had a slave that he valued, but who was sick and expected to die.
\v 3 He had heard about Yeshua, so he asked the \add local\add* Jewish elders to talk to Yeshua on his behalf and to ask him to come to heal his slave.
\v 4 When the elders got to \nd Yeshua\nd*, they earnestly implored him saying, “The man you’d be helping is worth it
\v 5 because he loves us Jews and he built the \add local\add* meeting hall for us.”
\p
\v 6 So \nd Yeshua\nd* went with them but as they got closer to the house, the commander had sent some friends to tell him, “\nd Master\nd*, don’t trouble yourself because I’m not worthy enough to have you enter my home
\v 7 and that’s why I never came to you personally. However, just issue a command and then my boy will be healed
\v 8 because I’m appointed under authority and have other soldiers under me. When I tell one of them to go, he goes, and when I tell one to come, he comes, and when I tell my slave to do something, he does it.”
\p
\v 9 When he heard that, \nd Yeshua\nd* was amazed and turned to face the crowd that was following him and said, “\wj I can tell you that never before in all of Israel have I encountered so much faith!\wj*”
\p
\v 10 By the time that the \add commander’s friends\add* had gotten back to the house, they found that the slave was already well again.
\s1 Yeshua brings the widow’s son back to life
\p
\v 11 The next day, Yeshua went to a town called Nain, and his followers went with him as well as a large crowd of people.
\v 12 As he got near the town gate, look, a dead boy was being carried out \add to the cemetery\add*. The mother was now a widow and he had been their only son, and a large number of the local residents were with her.
\v 13 When he saw her, the \nd master\nd* felt sorry for her and said, “\wj Don’t cry.\wj*”
\v 14 Then he went up closer and touched the coffin, and the pallbearers stopped. Then he spoke, “\wj Young man, I’m talking to you: get up.\wj*”
\v 15 The dead son sat up and started talking, and Yeshua led him to his mother.
\v 16 Everyone felt a bit apprehensive and they praised God saying, “A powerful prophet appeared among us,” and “God has been here with his people.”
\p
\v 17 Then the news about Yeshua spread all around Yudea and all the surrounding area.
\s1 Yohan checks out the messiah
\r (Mat. 11:2-19)
\p
\v 18 The apprentices of Yohan-the-Immerser reported all these things back to him and he choose two of his apprentices
\v 19 and sent them to \nd Yeshua\nd* to ask, “Are you the promised one, or should we wait for someone else?”
\p
\v 20 So when they got to Yeshua, the two men told him, “Yohan-the-Immerser sent us here to ask you if you’re the promised one, or should we wait for someone else?”
\p
\v 21 While they were still there, he healed many people from their diseases and difficulties, as well as evil spirits and some blind people being able to see again,
\v 22 \x + \xo 7:22: a \xt Isa 35:5-6; \xo b \xt Isa 61:1.\x*so then he answered them, “\wj Go and tell Yohan everything that you’ve seen and heard here: how blind people can see again, lame people are walking now, people with leprosy are clear, some dead have come back to life, and the good message is being preached to the poor.\wj*
\v 23 \wj God will bless those who don’t misjudge me.\wj*”
\p
\v 24 When Yohan’s messengers had left, Yeshua started asking the crowds about Yohan, “\wj What did you all go out into the wilderness to see? A reed waving in the wind?\wj*
\v 25 \wj Yes, but what did you all go out to see? A man dressed in fine clothes? Well, those in nice clothes and living in luxury are in fine homes.\wj*
\v 26 \wj So what was it that you went out to see? A prophet? Yes, I’ll tell you that he is more important than \add any old\add* prophet.\wj*
\v 27 \x + \xo 7:27: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*\wj He is the one that was written about: ‘See, I’m sending my messenger ahead of you and he will prepare your path before you get there.’\wj*
\v 28 \wj I’m telling all of you, no one who’s been born from a woman is greater than Yohan, yet the lowest person in God’s kingdom is greater than him.\wj*”
\p
\v 29 \x + \xo 7:29-30: \xt Mat 21:32; Luk 3:12.\x*(When all the people and the tax-collectors that had been immersed by Yohan heard that, they concurred that God’s way is fair,
\v 30 however the Pharisees and the lawyers who had not been immersed by him, they rejected God’s plan for them.)
\p
\v 31 “\wj So what can I compare this generation with?\wj*” asked Yeshua. “\wj Who are they similar to?\wj*
\v 32 \wj They’re like little children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to each other, ‘We played the flute for you all but you didn’t dance, then we played a sad song but you all didn’t weep.’\wj*
\v 33 \wj Because Yohan-the-Immerser came and he didn’t eat bread or drink wine, so you all said that he has a demon.\wj*
\v 34 \wj Then humanity’s child came and ate and drank and you all said, ‘Look, he’s a glutton and a drunkard—a friend of tax-collectors and those who disobey God.’\wj*
\v 35 \wj But wisdom is justified by all her children.\wj*”
\s1 The woman who anoints Yeshua’s feet
\p
\v 36 Another time, someone from the Pharisees party invited Yeshua to go to his place for a meal, and so he went there and reclined \add on a flat couch\add*.
\v 37 \x + \xo 7:37-38: \xt Yhn 12:3; Mrk 14:3; Mat 26:7.\x*Then wow, a sinful woman from the city who knew that he was reclining in there, \add came into the room and\add* carrying a \add beautiful carved\add* stone flask of scented skin-cream.
\v 38 She stood weeping behind Yeshua’s feet, wetting his feet with her tears. Then she used her hair to wipe off the tears and kissed his feet and \add rubbed\add* the lotion into them.
\v 39 When the Pharisee who had invited Yeshua saw this, he said to himself, “If that man was a prophet, he’d know who she is and what kind of woman it is that’s touching him, because she breaks God’s laws.”
\p
\v 40 “Simon,” \nd Yeshua\nd* asked him, “I need to tell you something.”
\p “Tell me, teacher,” he replied.
\p
\v 41 \add Then Yeshua told him this story:\add* “\wj Once there were two people who had borrowed from a money lender: one borrowed five-hundred coins and the other borrowed fifty.\wj*
\v 42 \wj But neither of them was able to repay him, so he wrote-off both of their debts. Now after that, which one of them do you think would appreciate him more?\wj*”
\p
\v 43 “I suppose,” answered Simon, “that it was the one who was forgiven the biggest debt.”
\p “\wj You’re right,\wj*” said Yeshua.
\v 44 Then looking at the woman he said to Simon, “\wj You see this woman? I came into your house but you didn’t give me any water to wash my feet, yet she wet my feet with her tears and then wiped them off with her hair.\wj*
\v 45 \wj You didn’t kiss me \add when I entered\add*, but this woman hasn’t stopped kissing my feet since I came in.\wj*
\v 46 \wj You didn’t offer olive oil for my head, but she anointed my feet with this lotion,\wj*
\v 47 \wj so that’s why I’ll tell you this: Her many sins have been forgiven because she showed a lot of love, but the one who has been forgiven little, is loving little.\wj*”
\p
\v 48 Then he said to the woman, “\wj Your sins have been forgiven.\wj*”
\p
\v 49 The others who were reclining in the room started to ask to each other, “Who \add does he think\add* he is to be able to even forgive sins.”
\p
\v 50 “\wj Your faith has saved you,\wj*” Yeshua said to the woman, “\wj Go in peace.\wj*”
\c 8
\s1 The team spreading the good message
\p
\v 1 After that, Yeshua started travelling around all the towns and villages—preaching and sharing the good message about God’s kingdom. His twelve trainees were with him
\v 2 \x + \xo 8:2-3: \xt Mrk 15:40-41; Mat 27:55-56; Luk 23:49.\x*along with some women who had been healed from evil spirits and sicknesses: Maria from Magdala (that seven demons had come out of),
\v 3 Yoanna (who’s Chusa’s wife and \add one of King\add* Herod’s managers), Susanna, and many others, who used the group’s assets to look after their needs.
\s1 The parable about spreading seeds
\r (Mark 4:1-9; Mat. 13:1-9)
\p
\v 4 A large crowd gathered around Yeshua, including many who had travelled out from the city, and he told them this parable:
\p
\v 5 “\wj \add One day\add* a \add farmer\add* went out to plant some seeds. As he spread the seeds, some of them fell along the path where they got trampled on, and the birds ate them.\wj*
\v 6 \wj Some of the seeds landed in a rocky area where they sprouted, but \add then\add* they withered up because they didn’t have enough moisture.\wj*
\v 7 \wj Some of the seeds landed in a patch of thistles, and as the plants started to grow, they were choked out by the thistles.\wj*
\v 8 \wj Some of the seeds fell onto good soil, and then the plants grew up to produce a harvest of one hundred times as much.\wj*”
\p As he was saying this, he was \add also\add* telling them, “\wj Anyone who wants to hear, listen carefully.\wj*”
\s1 The reason for parables
\r (Mark 4:10-12; Mat. 13:10-17)
\p
\v 9 \add After this,\add* his apprentices asked him, “What’s that parable all about?”
\v 10 \x + \xo 8:10: \xt Isa 6:9 (LXX).\x*“\wj You’re permitted to know the mysteries of God’s kingdom,\wj*” responded Yeshua, “\wj but the others get parables so that when they look, they won’t see, and when they listen, they won’t understand.\wj*
\s1 The meaning of the parable about the seeds
\r (Mark 4:13-20; Mat. 13:18-23)
\p
\v 11 “\wj \add So\add* this is what the parable \add means\add*: the seeds are God’s message.\wj*
\v 12 \wj The seeds along the road are those who hear \add the message\add*, but afterwards the devil comes along and snatches the message away from their hearts, so that they don’t believe or get saved.\wj*
\v 13 \wj The seeds among the rocks are those who happily accept the message but don’t put down any roots, so they believe for a \add short\add* time, and then when temptations come, they pull back from \add God\add*.\wj*
\v 14 \wj The seeds among the thistles are those who heard the message but get choked under worries and wealth and the good life, and so they never reach maturity.\wj*
\v 15 \wj But the seeds in the good soil are those good \add people\add* with good hearts and after hearing the message, they follow it, and produce fruit from their endurance.\wj*
\s1 The light will expose what’s hidden
\r (Mark 4:21-25)
\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 8:16: \xt Mat 5:15; Luk 11:33.\x*“\wj No one lights a lamp and then puts a cover over it or puts it under a bed, but rather it’s placed on a lampstand so that everyone coming into \add the room\add* can see the light.\wj*
\p
\v 17 \x + \xo 8:17: \xt Mat 10:26; Luk 12:2.\x*“\wj Similarly, nothing is hidden that won’t eventually become visible, and nothing is secret that won’t become known and exposed.\wj*
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 8:18: \xt Mat 25:29; Luk 19:26.\x*“\wj So take care in what you listen to, because anyone who has now, will be given more, and anyone who doesn’t have, whatever they think they do have will be taken away from them.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua’s mother and siblings
\r (Mark 3:31-35; Mat. 12:46-50)
\p
\v 19 Then Yeshua’s mother and brothers arrived but they couldn’t get close to him because of the crowd.
\v 20 “Your mother and brothers are standing outside,” someone told him, “and they want to see you.”
\p
\v 21 “\wj My mother and my brothers,\wj*” Yeshua responded, “\wj are anyone who’s listening to God’s message and who put it into practice.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua’s power over the wind and waves
\r (Mark 4:35-41; Mat. 8:23-27)
\p
\v 22 One day Yeshua and his apprentices got into a boat and he asked them to go across to the other side of Lake \add Galilee\add*. So they set off
\v 23 but once they were moving, Yeshua fell asleep. The a big storm descended onto the lake and the boat was being swamped \add by the waves\add* and they were in danger \add of sinking\add*.
\v 24 The apprentices went and woke Yeshua, “Master, we’re going to drown!”
\p Now awake, he spoke sternly to the wind and the waves in the lake, and they stopped and it became calm.
\v 25 “\wj Where’s your faith?\wj*” he asked them.
\p From being terrified, they were now astounded and asked each other, “Who is this guy \add really\add*? He can just tell the wind and the water what to do, and they obey him!”
\s1 Yeshua drives many demons into the pigs
\r (Mark 5:1-20; Mat. 8:28-34)
\p
\v 26 Then they sailed across to the region of the Gerasenes, which is across the lake from Galilee.
\v 27 As they got \add out of the boat\add*, a demon-possessed man who had come out of the city had met him there. He didn’t live in a house, but lived in a cemetery, and he wasn’t wearing a lot.
\v 28 He yelled out when he saw Yeshua and knelt down before him, and spoke loudly, “What \add business\add* do you and I have together, Yeshua, son of the highest \nd God\nd*? I beg you, don’t torture me.”
\v 29 \add He said this\add* because Yeshua had commanded the evil spirit to come out from the man. The demon had animated him many times and he’d \add needed\add* to be put in chains and shackles, but he would break them off and the demon would drive him into the wilderness.
\p
\v 30 “\wj What’s your name?\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* asked.
\p “Thousands,” he answered, because many thousands of demons had entered him
\v 31 and \add now\add* they were pleading with \add Yeshua\add* not to command them to go back to the bottomless pit.
\p
\v 32 \add They could see\add* a herd of pigs being fed on a hill, and they requested Yeshua to let them go into the pigs, and he agreed to that.
\v 33 So the demons rushed out of the man and into the pigs, and all the pigs then rushed down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.
\p
\v 34 When the \add workers\add* feeding the pigs saw this happen, they took off and told everyone in the \add nearby\add* town and round about.
\v 35 \nd So\nd* lots of people went \add there to the edge of the lake\add* to see for themselves, and they found the man who had been demon-possessed now dressed and sitting at \nd Yeshua’s\nd* feet with his full faculties, and they were frightened.
\v 36 The people who had seen it happen told the new-comers how the demon-possessed man had been healed.
\v 37 Then all those people from the Gerasenes region asked Yeshua to leave the area, because they were \add quite\add* terrified, so he got back into the boat and \add they\add* headed back to the other side.
\p
\v 38 The man who the demons had come out of had asked Yeshua if he could go with him, but Yeshua sent him away, saying,
\v 39 “\wj Go back to your house and tell \add them there\add* about what \nd God\nd* has done for you.\wj*”
\p So he went around the town telling everyone what \nd Yeshua\nd* had done for him.
\s1 The leader’s dying daughter plus the woman haemorrhaging
\r (Mark 5:21-43; Mat. 9:18-26)
\p
\v 40 When \nd Yeshua\nd* got back \add to the other side of the lake\add*, the crowd \add there\add* had been waiting for him and welcomed him.
\v 41 Then, wow, a man named Yairus came and knelt down in front of Yeshua. He was the leader at the \add local\add* meeting hall and he pleaded for Yeshua to come to his house
\v 42 because his only daughter, a twelve-year old, was dying.
\p Then while Yeshua was on his way squeezing through the crowd,
\v 43 a woman who’d had internal bleeding for twelve years and who couldn’t be helped \add by any doctor\add*,
\v 44 \add worked her way up\add* behind Yeshua and touched the edge of his robe. Immediately her bleeding stopped
\v 45 and \nd Yeshua\nd* \add stopped and\add* said, “\wj Who touched me?\wj*”
\p No one owned up, and Peter said, “Master, there’s people all around you and they’re pressing against you.”
\p
\v 46 “\wj Someone touched me,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* responded, “\wj because I felt power going out from me.\wj*”
\v 47 When the woman now saw that she wouldn’t get away with it, came to Yeshua shaking, and knelt down at his feet. She told him in front of all the people why she had touched his \add clothes\add* and how she’d been immediately healed.
\v 48 “\wj Daughter,\wj*” Yeshua said, “\wj your faith has healed you. Go in peace.\wj*”
\p
\v 49 While he was still speaking, someone came from the meeting hall leader’s \add home\add* and told \add him\add*, “Don’t bother the teacher any further. Your daughter just passed away.”
\p
\v 50 But \nd Yeshua\nd* heard this and \add turned to Yairus and\add* said, “\wj Don’t be afraid. Just believe and she’ll be healed.\wj*”
\p
\v 51 So they continued to the house, but Yeshua didn’t allow anyone inside other than Peter and Yohan and Yacob, along with the girl’s parents.
\v 52 Everyone was weeping and mourning for her, but he said, “\wj Don’t cry. She isn’t dead—just asleep.\wj*”
\p
\v 53 But they ridiculed Yeshua because they knew that she had died.
\v 54 He took hold of her hand, and called, “\wj Girl, get up.\wj*”
\v 55 Then her spirit returned and she got up immediately, and he asked them to get her something to eat.
\v 56 Her parents were astonished, but he instructed them not to tell anyone what had happened.
\c 9
\s1 Yeshua sends out his twelve apprentices
\r (Mark 6:7-13; Mat. 10:5-15)
\p
\v 1 Then Yeshua called together his twelve trainees and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases,
\v 2 and then sent them out to preach about God’s kingdom and to heal those who were sick.
\v 3 “\wj Don’t take anything for the journey,\wj*” he told them. “\wj Don’t take a walking stick or a backpack or food or money or spare clothes.\wj*
\v 4 \wj When someone invites you into their home, stay in that one house until you leave that place,\wj*
\v 5 \x + \xo 9:5: \xt Acts 13:51.\x*\wj but when the people don’t want to hear from you, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony to them \add that they’re now responsible to God for their own actions\add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 6 So they headed off, preaching the good message and healing the people as they walked from village to village.
\s1 Herod is confused by the news
\r (Mark 6:14-29; Mat. 14:1-12)
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 9:7-8: \xt Mrk 8:28; Mat 16:14; Luk 9:19.\x*Herod the ruler of the \add Galilean\add* quarter heard about everything that was going on and was completely puzzled, because some people said that Yohan the immerser had come back to life,
\v 8 while others said that Eliyah had been spotted, and others that one of the other ancient prophets had come back to life.
\v 9 “I beheaded Yohan,” \add King\add* Herod said, “so who is this man that I’m hearing so much about?” So he tried to find a way to see him.
\s1 Yeshua feeds 5,000 families
\r (Yhn 6:1-14; Mark 6:30-44; Mat. 14:13-21)
\p
\v 10 When the \add twelve\add* apprentices returned \add back to Yeshua\add*, they reported back to him everything they’d done. Then he took them to the town of Bethsaida for some private time,
\v 11 but the crowds saw where he went and followed after them, so he welcomed them and taught them about God’s kingdom as well as healing those who needed it.
\p
\v 12 As the day was coming to an end, the twelve approached him and said, “Send the crowd away so that they can go into the nearby towns and countryside to find somewhere to stay and something to eat, because this place is very isolated.”
\p
\v 13 But Yeshua told them, “\wj You all give them something to eat.\wj*”
\p “We don’t have anything more than just five breadrolls and two fish, unless we go and buy some food for all these people.”
\v 14 There were about 5,000 men \add (not counting women and children)\add*.
\p Then he told his apprentices, “\wj Sit them down in rows of about fifty each.\wj*”
\v 15 So they did that and everyone sat down.
\v 16 Then Yeshua took the five breadrolls and the two fish and looking up to the sky, he blessed them and broke them \add into pieces\add* to give to the apprentices to distribute to the crowd.
\v 17 Everyone ate until they were satisfied, and then twelve baskets of leftover pieces were collected up afterwards.
\s1 Peter’s recognition of the messiah
\r (Mark 8:27-29; Mat. 16:13-19)
\p
\v 18 Later when it was the time to pray and Yeshua and the \add twelve moved away from the crowd,\add* he asked them, “\wj Who do the crowds say that I am?\wj*”
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 9:19: \xt Mrk 6:14-15; Mat 14:1-2; Luk 9:7-8.\x*“\add Some say\add* Yohan-the-Immerser,” they answered, “while others say Eliyah, and others say that some other ancient prophet came back to life.”
\p
\v 20 \x + \xo 9:20: \xt Yhn 6:68-69.\x*“\wj And so who do you \add guys\add* say I am?\wj*” he asked.
\p “\add You’re\add* God’s \nd messiah\nd*,” Peter answered.
\s1 Yeshua tells about his coming suffering and death
\r (Mark 8:30-31; Mat. 16:20-21)
\p
\v 21 Then Yeshua warned them—instructing them not to tell this to anyone \add else\add*,
\v 22 saying, “\wj Humanity’s child needs to suffer many things and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the religious teachers, and then to be executed and to be brought back to life on the third day.\wj*”
\s1 The cost of following Yeshua
\r (Mark 8:34–9:1; Mat. 16:24-28)
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 9:23: \xt Mat 10:38; Luk 14:27.\x*Yeshua said, “\wj If anyone wants to become my follower, then that person needs to renounce their own desires and follow me, even in suffering and death,\wj*
\v 24 \x + \xo 9:24: \xt Yhn 12:25; Mat 10:39; Luk 17:33.\x*\wj because anyone who wants to save their own life will lose it, but anyone who is prepared to lose their live on account of me, they’ll be saving their life.\wj*
\v 25 \wj How would it benefit a person if they gained \add the wealth\add* of the whole world, but then ended up lost or destroyed?\wj*
\v 26 \wj Because anyone who’s ashamed of me and my teachings, humanity’s child will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his splendour and with the splendour of the father and of God’s messengers.\wj*
\v 27 \wj But I can certainly tell you that some of those who’re standing here won’t die until they see God’s kingdom.\wj*
\s1 Yeshua chats with Mosheh and Eliyah
\r (Mark 9:2-8; Mat. 17:1-8)
\p
\v 28 It was about eight days later that Yeshua took Peter and Yohan and Yacob, and climbed a hill to pray.
\v 29 While he was praying, the appearance of his face changed and his clothes turned brilliant white.
\v 30 Then, look, there were two men talking with him—Mosheh and Eliyah!
\v 31 Those two who’d been \add in heaven\add* were talking about the end of his time here which was about to actioned in Yerusalem.
\v 32 Peter and the others had been exhausted and fallen asleep, but when they woke up they saw the radiance of Yeshua and the other two standing there with him,
\v 33 but when it was time for the two to leave, Peter said to \nd Yeshua\nd*, “Master, it’s good that we’re here. We could make three shelters: one for you, one for Mosheh, and one for Eliyah.” (But he didn’t really know what he was saying.)
\p
\v 34 While he was still speaking, a cloud appeared and enveloped them and they were afraid as they entered the fog.
\v 35 \x + \xo 9:35: \xt Isa 42:1; Mrk 1:11; Mat 3:17; 12:18; Luk 3:22.\x*Then a voice came out of the cloud that said, “This is my son, the one that has been chosen. Listen to him.”
\p
\v 36 By the time that the voice had spoken, they could only \add see\add* \nd Yeshua\nd* in front of them. \add After this event\add*, they kept what had happened to themselves and didn’t tell anyone else about what they had seen.
\s1 Yeshua heals a demon-possessed boy
\r (Mark 9:14-27; Mat. 17:14-18)
\p
\v 37 When they came back down the hill the next day, a big crowd was waiting for them.
\v 38 Then, look, a man in the crowd shouted out, “Teacher, I implore you to come and look at my son, because he’s my only child.
\v 39 A spirit takes control of him and suddenly he cries out and it makes him convulse and foam at the mouth, and only leaves him after a long time when he’s bruised \add and battered\add*.
\v 40 I tried to get your apprentices to drive it out, but they couldn’t.”
\p
\v 41 “\wj Oh you unbelieving and perverted generation,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj how much longer do I have to be with you and put up with all of you? Bring your son here.\wj*”
\p
\v 42 While they were still approaching, the demon attacked the boy and threw him in a convulsion, but \nd Yeshua\nd* rebuked the evil spirit and healed the boy and led him back to his father.
\v 43 Everyone there was astounded at God’s power.
\s1 Yeshua talks again about his death
\r (Mark 9:30-32; Mat. 17:22-23)
\p While all the people were still amazed at what he’d done, Yeshua \add turned and\add* said to his apprentices,
\v 44 “\wj Remember everything that’s been said, because humanity’s child is going to be turned in and placed into the hands of \add these\add* people.\wj*”
\v 45 But \add the apprentices\add* didn’t know what he meant as it was hidden from them so they couldn’t comprehend it, plus they were afraid to ask him to explain further.
\s1 Who is the greatest?
\r (Mark 9:33-37; Mat. 18:1-5)
\p
\v 46 \x + \xo 9:46: \xt Luk 22:24.\x*Then the apprentices got themselves into a discussion about who was the greatest among them.
\v 47 But \nd Yeshua\nd* knew what was going on, so he took a young child and stood the child there alone
\v 48 \x + \xo 9:48: \xt Yhn 13:20; Mat 10:40; Luk 10:16.\x*and told them, “\wj Anyone who accepts a young child in my name is accepting me, and anyone who accepts me is accepted the one who sent me here. Because it’s the person who is the least among you that is great.\wj*”
\s1 The one not against you is for you
\r (Mark 9:38-40)
\p
\v 49 “Master,” Yohan answered, “we saw someone driving out demons using your name, and we told him to stop because he’s not one of us.”
\p
\v 50 “\wj Don’t forbid \add people like\add* him,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* replied, “\wj because anyone who’s not against you all, is for you.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua gets snubbed by a village in Samaria
\p
\v 51 It was now coming to the time when the events leading to his ascension would start happening, so Yeshua firmed his resolve to head towards Yerusalem
\v 52 and he sent his apprentices ahead of him.
\p So they started off and arrived at a Samaritan village and went to get ready for his arrival,
\v 53 but the people there didn’t welcome them because Yeshua’s resolve was to get to Yerusalem.
\v 54 \x + \xo 9:54: \xt 2Ki 1:9-16.\x*Seeing this, his apprentices Yacob and Yohan asked, “\nd Master\nd*, will you let us call fire down from the sky to burn them up?”
\p
\v 55 However, Yeshua turned around and told them off,
\v 56 so they headed off to another village.
\s1 The people who would have liked to follow Yeshua
\r (Mat. 8:19-22)
\p
\v 57 As they headed down the road, someone told Yeshua, “I’ll follow you wherever you go to.”
\p
\v 58 “\wj \nd Foxes\nd* have their burrows,\wj*” he responded, “\wj and the birds have their nests, but humanity’s child has no \add home\add* where he can lie down \add and relax\add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 59 Later he told a different person, “\wj Follow me.\wj*”
\p But the man replied, “\nd Master\nd*, just let me first go and bury my father.”
\p
\v 60 “\wj Leave those who’re dead to bury the dead by themselves,\wj*” Yeshua said, “\wj but you go and tell \add people\add* about God’s kingdom.\wj*”
\p
\v 61 \x + \xo 9:61: \xt 1Ki 19:20.\x*Also, another person said, “I’ll follow after you, \nd master\nd*, but first let me go back and say goodbye to everyone at home.”
\p
\v 62 But \nd Yeshua\nd* responded, “\wj No one who starts ploughing a field and then starts looking backwards is suitable for God’s kingdom.\wj*”

\s1 Yeshua sends out 72 people

\v 1 After all this, the \nd master\nd* appointed seventy-two others and he sent them out in pairs to go ahead of him to every town and village that he would pass through.
\v 2 \x + \xo 10:2: \xt Mat 9:37-38.\x*He told them, “\wj There’s a large harvest \add ready\add*, but there’s only a few workers. So ask the owner of the crop to send out more workers to help with his harvest.\wj*
\v 3 \x + \xo 10:3: \xt Mat 10:16.\x*\wj So get moving—see, I’m sending you out like lambs with wolves all around.\wj*
\v 4 \wj Don’t take a wallet or backpack or \add spare\add* sandals, and don’t greet people on the road.\wj*
\p
\v 5 “\wj Whenever you’re welcomed into a home, first say, ‘Peace to this house.’\wj*
\v 6 \wj And if there’s someone there worthy of peace\f + \fr 10:6 \ft It’s not obvious what Yeshua is referring to here with ‘son of peace’.\f*, then your peace will rest on that home, but if not, your peace will return to you.\wj*
\v 7 \x + \xo 10:7: \xt 1Cor 9:14; 1Tim 5:18.\x*\wj Then stay in that same house and eat and drink what they give you, because the worker is worthy of his compensation. Don’t be moving from house to house.\wj*
\v 8 \wj Whenever you all go into some place and the locals accept you, then eat what they give you.\wj*
\v 9 \wj Heal the sick there and tell them that God’s kingdom is near.\wj*
\v 10 \x + \xo 10:10-11: \xt Acts 13:51.\x*\wj But if you all go into some place and they don’t accept you, then go out to the roads and announce,\wj*
\v 11 \x + \xo 10:4-11: \xt Mrk 6:8-11; Mat 10:7-14; Luk 9:3-5.\x*\wj ‘We’re wiping off even the dust from your place that stuck to our footwear, however you all need to know \add anyway\add* that God’s kingdom is near.’\wj*
\v 12 \x + \xo 10:12: a \xt Gen 19:24-28; Mat 11:24; \xo b \xt Mat 10:15.\x*\wj I’m telling you that it will be more bearable for the people of Sodom in that day than for the people in that place.\wj*
\s1 Those who ignore the good message
\r (Mat. 11:20-24)
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 10:13: \xt Isa 23:1-18; Eze 26:1–28:26; Yoel 3:4-8; Amos 1:9-10; Zech 9:2-4.\x*“\wj You won’t end well, Korazin. And you won’t end well, Bethsaida. Because if the miracles that were done in your places had been done in Tyre and Tsidon, they would have turned around from disobeying God and shown their humility long ago\wj*
\v 14 \wj hence it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Tsidon on judgement \add day\add* than it will be for you all.\wj*
\v 15 \x + \xo 10:15: \xt Isa 14:13-15.\x*\wj And you, Capernaum, don’t think you’ll be heading up to heaven, because it’ll be down to hell for you.\wj*
\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 10:16: \xt Yhn 13:20; Mrk 9:37; Mat 10:40; Luk 9:48.\x*“\wj Anyone who listens to all of you, will be hearing from me, and anyone who rejects you all will be rejecting me, and anyone who rejects me is rejecting the one who sent me here.\wj*
\s1 The return of the 72
\p
\v 17 \add In time,\add* the seventy-two \add that had been sent out\add* came back excited, saying, “\nd Master\nd*, even the demons listened to us when we used your name \add and authority\add*.”
\p
\v 18 “\wj I saw Satan,\wj*” Yeshua replied, “\wj when he fell out of heaven like lightning.\wj*
\v 19 \x + \xo 10:19: \xt Psa 91:13.\x*\wj Listen, I’ve given you all the authority to tread on snakes and scorpions and to overcome the enemy’s power, and nothing at all will be able to injure you.\wj*
\v 20 \wj However, don’t get excited that the \add evil\add* spirits obeyed you, but rather be happy that your names have been written down in the heavens.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua’s happiness
\r (Mat. 11:25-27; 13:16-17)
\p
\v 21 At the same time, the holy \nd spirit\nd* got Yeshua excited and he said, “\wj I’m aware father, \nd master\nd* of heaven and earth, that you’ve hidden these things away from those who’re intelligent and well-educated, and \add instead\add* revealed them to infants. Yes, father, that was what you decided.\wj*
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 10:22: a \xt Yhn 3:35; \xo b \xt Yhn 10:15.\x*\wj Everything has been handed over to me by my father, and no one knows who the son is except for the father, and who the father is except for the son and those who the son decides to reveal him to.\wj*”
\p
\v 23 Then he turned to his apprentices and said discreetly, “\wj Blessed are those who get to see what you all are seeing\wj*
\v 24 \wj because I can tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you all are seeing, but they didn’t get to see what you’ve seen, nor to hear what you all have heard.\wj*”
\s1 How to be a neighbour
\p
\v 25 \x + \xo 10:25-28: \xt Mrk 12:28-34; Mat 22:35-40.\x*Then look, a lawyer stood us to test him, asking, “Teacher, what do I need to do to inherit eternal life?”
\p
\v 26 “\wj \add Well,\add* what’s written in the scriptures?\wj*” responded Yeshua. “\wj How do you understand them?\wj*”
\p
\v 27 \x + \xo 10:27: a \xt Deu 6:5; \xo b \xt Lev 19:18.\x*“You must love the \nd master\nd*, your \nd God\nd*, with all your heart and all your soul, and all your strength and all your mind,” he replied. “Also, \add you must love\add* your neighbour as yourself.”
\p
\v 28 \x + \xo 10:28: \xt Lev 18:5.\x*“\wj You’ve answered correctly,\wj*” answered Yeshua, “\wj so do that and you’ll live \add forever\add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 29 But \add the lawyer\add* wanted to justify his \add lifestyle\add*, so he asked, “\nd And\nd* who’s my neighbour?”
\p
\v 30 \nd Yeshua\nd* replied \add with this\add*: “\wj Once a man was walking downhill from Yerusalem to Yericho when \add a group of\add* robbers grabbed him and took \add everything including\add* his clothes, then took off leaving him there wounded and half-dead.\wj*
\v 31 \wj Then it so happened that a priest came down that same road, but when he saw him he continued past on the other side of the road.\wj*
\v 32 \wj Similarly, a priestly worker (a Levite) arrived at that place and when he saw him he too passed by on the other side.\wj*
\v 33 \x + \xo 10:33-34: \xt 2Ch 28:15.\x*\wj Then a man from Samaria\f + \fr 10:33 \ft The Judeans and the Samaritans despised each other and disagreed on many vital issues.\f* who was on a trip came across him, and when he saw him he felt sorry for him\wj*
\v 34 \wj and went up to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring olive oil and wine on them, then put him on his own animal and took him to a roadhouse and looked after him.\wj*
\v 35 \wj The next day he took out two coins and gave them to their host, instructing, ‘Look after this guy and if it costs more than this, I’ll reimburse you on my way back.’\wj*
\p
\v 36 “\wj So which of those three do you think acted like the neighbour of the one attacked by robbers?\wj*”
\p
\v 37 “The one who cared for him,” replied \add the lawyer\add*.
\p “\wj Then you go and do the same,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* told him.
\s1 Yeshua visits Martha and Maria
\p
\v 38 \x + \xo 10:38-39: \xt Yhn 11:1.\x*When it was time to leave, Yeshua went into a village and there was a woman there named Martha who welcomed him in.
\v 39 She had a sister named Maria who was also sitting there \add on the floor\add* by \nd Yeshua’s\nd* feet listening to his teaching.
\v 40 But Martha kept getting pulled away to keep the household running, and \add after a while\add* approached Yeshua and asked, “\nd Master\nd*, doesn’t it bother you that my sister has left all the housework to me? Tell her to come and help me.”
\p
\v 41 “\wj Martha, Martha,\wj*” Yeshua answered, “\wj you are worried and concerned about many things,\wj*
\v 42 \wj but only one thing really matters. Maria chose the best thing, and it won’t be taken away from her.\wj*”
\c 11
\s1 Yeshua teaches about prayer
\r (Mat. 6:9-13; 7:7-11)
\p
\v 1 One time Yeshua was at a place praying, and when he finished some of his followers asked him, “\nd Master\nd*, Yohan-the-Immerser taught his apprentices how to pray. You teach us as well.”
\p
\v 2 So Yeshua told them, “\wj Whenever you all pray, say this:\wj*
\q1 \wj Father, may your name be honoured.\wj*
\q1 \wj May your kingdom come \add to pass\add*.\wj*
\q1
\v 3 \wj Every day give us the food that we need.\wj*
\q1
\v 4 \wj Forgive us for our sins because we’ve forgiven those who owed \add something\add* to us.\wj*
\q1 \wj Don’t bring us into \add situations where\add* we’re tempted.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 Then he told them, “\wj \add Imagine\add* you had a friend and went to them at midnight and asked, ‘Friend, lend me some bread\wj*
\v 6 \wj because a travelling friend of mine arrived at my place, and I haven’t got anything to give him to eat.’\wj*
\v 7 \wj And the one in the \add other\add* house might reply, ‘Don’t bother me \add now\add* because the house is locked and the kids are asleep beside me here in the bed. I can’t get up and get anything for you.’\wj*
\v 8 \wj I’m telling all of you that even if that friend wouldn’t get up and give them anything because of their friendship, then the friend will certainly get up and give them \add some food\add* if they persist \add in knocking\add*.\wj*
\v 9 \wj So this is what I’m telling you: \add Keep submitting\add* your requests and it’ll be given to you all, keep searching and you’ll all find \add what you’re looking for\add*, keep knocking and the door will be opened for you all,\wj*
\v 10 \wj because everyone who requests will receive, and everyone who searches will find, and everyone who knocks will find opened \add doors\add*.\wj*
\v 11 \wj How many of you fathers, if your child asked you for \add some\add* fish, you’d give them a snake instead?\wj*
\v 12 \wj Or the child would ask for an egg and you’d pass them a scorpion?\wj*
\v 13 \wj So if you all know how to give good things to your children despite your being evil, how much more the father in heaven will give the holy \nd spirit\nd* to those who ask him.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua is accused of being demon-possessed
\r (Mark 3:20-27; Mat. 12:22-30)
\p
\v 14 Then Yeshua drove out a demon that caused muteness, and after the demon departed, the man was able to speak. The crowds were amazed,
\v 15 \x + \xo 11:15: \xt Mat 9:34; 10:25.\x*but yet some of them said, “He’s driving out demons because he’s Beelzebul the leader of the demons.”
\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 11:16: \xt Mrk 8:11; Mat 12:38; 16:1.\x*Others who wanted to test \add who he was\add*, asked Yeshua to send a sign from heaven,
\v 17 but he knew their thoughts and told them, “\wj Any kingdom that’s divided against itself is doomed, and any household that’s divided will self-destruct.\wj*
\v 18 \wj So if Satan was fighting against himself, how could his kingdom even remain? Yes, I know that you’re all saying that I must be Beelzebul in order to drive out demons,\wj*
\v 19 \wj but if I have Beelzebul’s power over demons, then whose power do \em your\em* apprentices use to drive out demons?\wj*
\v 20 \wj However if I’m driving out demons with power that comes from God, then that means that God’s kingdom is right in the middle of you all.\wj*
\p
\v 21 “\wj Whenever a strong \add landowner\add* arms himself and guards his nice home, everything remains there peacefully,\wj*
\v 22 \wj but when someone stronger than him arrives and overpowers him, he’ll even take the body armour that the \add landowner\add* put his trust in, and then relieve him of all his goods.\wj*
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 11:23: \xt Mrk 9:40.\x*“\wj Anyone who doesn’t \add follow\add* me is against me, and anyone who doesn’t gather with us, \add wants to\add* scatter us.\wj*
\s1 The return of demons
\r (Mat. 12:43-45)
\p
\v 24 “\wj Whenever an evil spirit leaves a person, it roams through inhospitable places looking for \add somewhere to\add* rest, and when it doesn’t find \add a home\add*, it says, ‘\add Ah,\add* I’ll return to the home that I recently left.’\wj*
\v 25 \wj Then when it gets back there, it finds the home swept out and tidied up,\wj*
\v 26 \wj so it goes and finds seven other spirits more evil than itself. They all move in and live there, so the result is that the person ends up worse in the end than \add they were\add* at the beginning.\wj*”
\s1 God’s true reward
\p
\v 27 While Yeshua was teaching these things, a women in the crowd shouted out, “Blessed is the mother who bore you and the one who raised you.”
\p
\v 28 “\wj Actually,\wj*” Yeshua replied, “\wj the ones who will be blessed are all those who listen to God’s message and put it into practice.\wj*”
\s1 The crowd requests a miracle
\r (Mat. 12:38-42)
\p
\v 29 \x + \xo 11:29: \xt Mrk 8:12; Mat 16:4.\x*The crowds had grown even larger, but Yeshua told them, “\wj This generation is evil because they’re requesting a miracle and the only miracle that will be given to them will be the miracle of Yonah.\wj*
\v 30 \x + \xo 11:30: \xt Yonah 3:4.\x*\wj In the same way that Yonah became a sign to the \add citizens\add* of Ninevah, so too humanity’s child will also be to this generation.\wj*
\v 31 \x + \xo 11:31: \xt 1Ki 10:1-10; 2Ch 9:1-12.\x*\wj The queen from the south will come back to life on judgement \add day\add* along with the people from this generation, and she’ll condemn them, because she travelled a long distance to hear Solomon’s wisdom, and now, someone’s here who’s greater than Solomon.\wj*
\v 32 \x + \xo 11:32: \xt Yonah 3:5.\x*\wj The people of Ninevah will stand up on judgement \add day\add* along with the people from this generation and they’ll condemn this generation because those from Ninevah turned from their disobedience after Yonah’s preaching, and now, someone’s here who’s greater than Yonah.\wj*
\s1 The eye is the body’s lamp
\r (Mat. 5:15; 6:22-23)
\p
\v 33 \x + \xo 11:33: \xt Mrk 4:21; Mat 5:15; Luk 8:16.\x*“\wj No one lights a lamp and then hides it somewhere or puts it under a basket, but rather they put it on a lampstand so that everyone entering \add the room\add* can see the light \add from it\add*.\wj*
\v 34 \wj Your eyes are like the lamp for your body. Whenever your eyes are healthy, your \add entire\add* body will be bright, but when your eyes are evil, your body is also dark,\wj*
\v 35 \wj so take care in case the light in you has gone dark.\wj*
\v 36 \wj Therefore if your whole body is bright without any dark areas, it will be bright all over, like when a lamp shines on you to illuminate you.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua’s warning about the religious teachers
\r (Mark 12:38-40; Mat. 23:1-36)
\p
\v 37 When Yeshua \add had a break from\add* speaking, a member of the Pharisee party invited him over for breakfast, so he went into the house and sat down,
\v 38 and the man was very surprised that he didn’t observe the handwashing ceremony before he ate.
\v 39 But the \nd master\nd* said to his host, “\wj Yes, all of you in the Pharisee party clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but your insides are full of theft and wickedness.\wj*
\v 40 \wj How stupid! Didn’t \add God\add* who made the outside part, also make what’s inside?\wj*
\v 41 \wj However, if you sacrificially give what’s inside, then everything would then become clean for you.\wj*
\p
\v 42 \x + \xo 11:42: \xt Lev 27:30.\x*“\wj But you Pharisees won’t end well, because you give a tenth of your herbs and vegetables, yet you all ignore giving justice and loving \nd God\nd*, both of which need to be done and cannot be ignored.\wj*
\p
\v 43 “\wj You Pharisees won’t end well, because you all love the best seats in the meeting halls and the \add honoured\add* greetings in the marketplaces.\wj*
\v 44 \wj You all won’t end well, because you’re like unmarked graves that people walk all over without even realising\add —the people simply don’t know that you’re dead inside\add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 45 One of the experts in religious rules \add there\add* answered him \add back\add*, “Teacher, you’re insulting us as well when you say that.”
\p
\v 46 “\wj \add Well,\add* you law experts won’t end well,\wj*” Yeshua responded, “\wj because you put unbearably \add heavy\add* burdens onto the shoulders of the people, yet you wouldn’t move your \add little\add* fingers to touch those burdens yourselves.\wj*
\v 47 \wj You all won’t end well, because you all build \add fancy\add* tombs for the prophets that your own ancestors executed.\wj*
\v 48 \wj Because of that, you’re all \add actually\add* admitting and agreeing to what your ancestors did, because they killed them and \add then\add* you build their tombs.\wj*
\v 49 \wj That’s why \nd God\nd* in his wisdom said, ‘I’ll send prophets and missionaries to them, which they will \add then\add* persecute and kill\wj*’
\v 50 \wj so that the blood of those prophets which was spilt from the creation of the world \add onwards\add* would then be charged to this generation.\wj*
\v 51 \x + \xo 11:51: a \xt Gen 4:8; \xo b \xt 2Ch 24:20-21.\x*\wj \add This goes all the way back to\add* to the blood of Abel, right up to the blood of Zechariah who was \add recently\add* killed between the altar and the temple sanctuary. Yes, I’m telling all of you, \add those crimes\add* will be charged to \em this\em* generation.\wj*
\p
\v 52 “\wj You religious law experts won’t end well, because you took away the key to knowledge—not only did you not enter \add yourselves\add*, but you also forbade others from entering.\wj*”
\p
\v 53 Once Yeshua left that \add house\add*, the religious teachers and the Pharisee party started strongly resenting him, and started \add a plan of\add* asking him more questions
\v 54 in the hope of catching an answer \add that could be used to condemn him\add*.

\s1 Everything hidden will be revealed
\r (Mat. 10:26-27)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 12:1: \xt Mrk 8:15; Mat 16:6.\x*By then the crowd had grown to many thousands, so much so that they were trampling on each other. Meanwhile Yeshua started telling his followers, “\wj Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees party which is hypocrisy.\wj*
\v 2 \x + \xo 12:2: \xt Mrk 4:22; Luk 8:17.\x*\wj But everything that’s covered up \add now\add*, will be uncovered \add in the future\add*, and everything that’s \add now\add* hidden will revealed.\wj*

\s1 Who to be afraid of
\r (Mat. 10:28-31)
\p
\v 4 “\wj And I’m telling you, my friends, that you shouldn’t be afraid of those who can kill your body (and after that they don’t have anything more that they can do).\wj*
\v 5 \wj But I’ll tell you who you should be afraid of: Be afraid of the one who has the authority to throw you into hell after you’re dead—yes, that’s who you should be afraid of.\wj*
\p
\v 6 “\wj Aren’t five small birds sold for just a couple of small coins? Yet not one of those birds is forgotten by \nd God\nd*.\wj*
\v 7 \wj Yes, \add God\add* even knows the number of hairs on your head so don’t worry, \add each\add* one of you is of more value than \add a whole flock of\add* birds.\wj*
\s1 Disowning the messiah
\r (Mat. 10:32-33; 12:32; 10:19-20)
\p
\v 8 “\wj I’m telling you that everyone who admits in public to following me, so too humanity’s child will tell your name to God’s messengers,\wj*

\s1 The parable about accumulating wealth
\p
\v 13 Then someone in the crowd said, “Teacher, tell my brother to give me a share of our father’s estate.”
\p
\v 14 “\wj Man,\wj*” Yeshua responded, “\wj who said that I’m the judge or arbitrator over you all?\wj*”
\v 15 Then he told them, “\wj Keep alert to avoid all greediness, because a person’s life is not about gaining lots of possessions.\wj*”
\p
\v 16 Then he told them all this parable, “\wj One time a rich man’s farm produced a really good harvest.\wj*
\v 17 \wj So he started figuring out what do do, ‘What should I do because I don’t have anywhere to store my harvest.’\wj*
\v 18 \wj ‘Ah,’ he said, ‘I know what I’ll do. I’ll knock down my barns and build bigger ones, and then I’ll store all my grain and other produce in there.\wj*
\v 19 \wj Then I’ll be able to tell my soul: Soul, you’ve got enough good things now to be able to relax for many years of resting, eating, drinking, and being happy.’\wj*
\v 20 \wj But \nd God\nd* said to him, ‘How foolish! Tonight I’ll be requesting your soul and then who will everything you stored up go to?’\wj*
\p
\v 21 “\wj So \add that’s the end\add* of someone who accumulated so much for himself, but wasn’t rich in God’s \add eyes\add*.\wj*”
\s1 Priorities and trusting God
\r (Mat. 6:25-34)
\p
\v 22 Then Yeshua told his followers, “\wj That’s why I’m telling you all not to worry about your lifestyle: what to eat or what to wear,\wj*
\v 23 \wj because your life is more than food and your body is more than clothing.\wj*
\v 24 \wj Look at the ravens. They don’t plant seeds or harvest crops and they have no storerooms or barns, yet \nd God\nd* keeps them fed, and \add humans\add* are worth a lot more than birds.\wj*
\v 25 \wj Which of you can add even an hour to your life by spending more time worrying?\wj*
\v 26 \wj So if you can’t even do something small like that, why worry about bigger things.\wj*
\v 27 \x + \xo 12:27: \xt 1Ki 10:4-7; 2Ch 9:3-6.\x*\wj Look at how the lilies grow. They don’t go to work or make \add fabric\add*, yet even \add King\add* Solomon at the height of his fame wasn’t dressed as well as one of them.\wj*
\v 28 \wj So if \nd God\nd* dresses the weeds in the paddock that are here today and incinerated tomorrow, how much more would he look after you all—you with little faith?\wj*
\p
\v 29 “\wj So don’t all be looking for what to eat or to drink, and don’t \add waste time\add* by worrying\wj*
\v 30 \wj because people in every country in the world are looking for that, but your father \add already\add* knows that you need those things.\wj*
\v 31 \wj Rather you should be striving \add to enter\add* his kingdom, and then all these things will come as a bonus.\wj*
\s1 Focus on heavenly wealth
\r (Mat. 6:19-21)
\p
\v 32 “\wj Don’t be afraid, little flock, because \add actually\add* your father takes pleasure in giving you the entire kingdom.\wj*
\v 33 \wj Sell what you own and give to the poor \add and so\add* store your wealth in heaven where it won’t deteriorate or get lost or stolen \add from you\add*,\wj*

\s1 Good and bad slaves

\v 41 Then Peter asked, “\nd Master\nd*, is that parable just for us, or is it for everyone?”

\v 42 The master answered, “\wj So what would a faithful and wise slave be like, that the master might make into a manager over all his slaves, the one to give them their rations?\wj*
\v 43 \wj That slave will be blessed when his master arrives and finds him doing everything he should.\wj*
\v 44 \wj I can assure you all that the master will put him in charge of everything he owns.\wj*
\v 45 \wj In contrast, if that slave thought to himself that the master might be away for a long time, he might start beating the slave boys and slave girls, and start ordering feasts, and drinking and getting drunk,\wj*
\v 46 \wj then his master is sure to arrive when he’s not expecting him, and the master will give him a gruesome execution and he’ll be \add in hell\add* with the unbelievers.\wj*
\p
\v 47 “\wj Any slave who knows what their master wants, yet doesn’t get anything ready or start doing what’s wanted, they’ll get a good beating,\wj*
\v 48 \wj yet a slave that didn’t know what was expected, even if they might have done things worthy of a beating, they’ll just get a couple of blows. Everyone who’s given much is expected to do much, and everyone who’s entrusted with many things, will have much more expected \add back\add* from them.\wj*
\s1 Yeshua will be the source of conflict
\r (Mat. 10:34-36)
\p
\v 49 “\wj I came to throw fire onto the earth, and how I wish that it was already kindled,\wj*
\v 50 \x + \xo 12:50: \xt Mrk 10:38.\x*\wj but I have to undergo an immersion \add into suffering\add*, and until it’s achieved, the weight of it \add coming\add* crushes my \add soul\add*.\wj*
\v 51 \wj You all \add probably\add* expect that I came to bring peace to the earth? No, I’m telling you, \add not peace\add* but conflict,\wj*
\v 52 \wj because from now on, if there’s five \add people\add* in one house, they’ll be split with three against two and two against three.\wj*
\v 53 \x + \xo 12:53: \xt Mic 7:6.\x*\wj Fathers will be in conflict with their sons, and sons with fathers, mothers against daughters and daughters against mothers, mothers-in-law against their daughters-in-law and daughters-in-law against mothers-in-law.\wj*”
\s1 Understanding the times
\r (Mat. 16:2-3)
\p
\v 54 Yeshua also told the crowds, “\wj Whenever you see a cloud coming from the west, you all say that it’s going to rain, and sure enough it does.\wj*”
\v 55 \wj Likewise if there’s a wind from the south, you all say that it’s going to be a scorcher, and sure enough it is.\wj*
\v 56 \wj Hypocrites! You know how to interpret the sky and the ground, but you all don’t know how to scrutinise this time period.\wj*
\s1 Facing up to your obligations
\r (Mat. 5:25-26)
\p
\v 57 “\wj Even for yourselves, can’t you judge what is right \add and wrong\add*?\wj*
\v 58 \wj Because as you’re on the way with your opponent to an arbitrator, think \add hard\add* about how to resolve the case, because if you don’t, he might drag you off to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the constable, and the constable will toss you into a prison cell.\wj*
\v 59 \wj I’m telling you that you won’t get out of there until every last \add penny\add* has been repaid.\wj*”
\c 13
\s1 Turn from your sins so you won’t perish
\p
\v 1 There were some people there at the time that had reported to Yeshua how that \add Governor\add* Pilate had \add killed\add* some Galileans when they were sacrificing.
\v 2 Yeshua asked the people, “\wj Do you think that these Galileans were the most disobedient to God in all Galilee that they were made to suffer so much?\wj*
\v 3 \wj No, I’m telling you all, but on the other hand if you don’t turn from your own disobedience and request forgiveness, you all will perish likewise.\wj*
\v 4 \wj What about those eighteen who were killed when the Siloam tower collapsed on them. Do you think they had bigger debts than all the people living in Yerusalem?\wj*
\v 5 \wj No, I’m telling you all that if you don’t turn from your own disobedience and request forgiveness, you all will perish likewise.\wj*”
\s1 The parable about the tree without fruit
\p
\v 6 Then Yeshua told \add them\add* this parable, “\wj There was a \add landowner\add* who had planted a fig tree in his vineyard, and he went to see if it had any fruit on it, but there wasn’t any\wj*
\v 7 \wj so he told his manager, ‘I’ve been coming and checking for fruit on this tree for three years, but there’s none. Chop it down because it’s not good use of the land.’\wj*
\v 8 \wj ‘Master,’ he answered, ‘give me one more year to dig around it and fertilise it\wj*
\v 9 \wj and see if it fruits. If it doesn’t, then certainly you can chop it down.’\wj* ”
\s1 Yeshua heals a bent-over woman
\p
\v 10 On the Rest Days, Yeshua was teaching in one of the meeting halls
\v 11 and, look, a woman who’d had a spirit of sickness for eighteen years was there. She was bent over and unable to stand up straight
\v 12 and when \nd Yeshua\nd* saw her, he called out, “\wj Woman, your disease has been sent away.\wj*”
\v 13 Then he placed his hands on her and she was immediately restored and started praising \nd God\nd*.
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 13:14: \xt Exo 20:9-10; Deu 5:13-14.\x*But the hall leader was angry because it was the Rest Day when \nd Yeshua\nd* had healed her and started telling the crowd, “There’s six days when it’s fine to work, so come then to be healed—not on the Rest Day!”
\p
\v 15 “\wj \add You\add* hypocrites!\wj*” Yeshua responded. “\wj Doesn’t every one of you untie his ox on the Rest Day, or untie the donkey from the feeding trough and led it away for a drink?\wj*
\v 16 \wj This woman is a descendant of Abraham who’s been handicapped by Satan for eighteen years, and \add yet you say\add* that it’s wrong to break that bond on the Rest Day!\wj*”
\v 17 When he said that, the people opposing him were disgraced and all the crowd was excited about the wonderful things he was doing.
\s1 A small seed grows into a large bush
\r (Mark 4:30-32; Mat. 13:31-32)
\p
\v 18 So he told them, “\wj What is God’s kingdom similar to? What can I use to describe it?\wj*
\v 19 \wj It’s like a mustard seed, which a person might take and throw into their garden and then it grows in a bush and the birds make their nests in its branches.\wj*”
\s1 A little yeast has a big effect
\r (Mat. 13:33)
\p
\v 20 Again he asked them, “\wj What can I liken God’s kingdom to?\wj*
\v 21 \wj It’s like some yeast that a woman took and hid in a sack of flour, until \add eventually\add* it affected all of it.\wj*”
\s1 Entering God’s kingdom
\r (Mat. 7:13-14,21-23)
\p
\v 22 Then Yeshua started on his journey towards Yerusalem and as he passed through each town or village, he would teach \add the people there\add*
\v 23 and \add one day\add* someone asked him, “\nd Master\nd*, will only a few \add people\add* be saved?”
\p Yeshua replied,
\v 24 \wj Make an effort to get in through the narrow door, because I’m telling you that many people want to come in but they won’t be able to.\wj*
\v 25 \wj Once the home-owner gets up and locks the door, even if you \add get there now and\add* stand outside knocking and calling out, ‘Master, open us for us,’ he’ll answer, ‘I don’t know you or where you’re from.’\wj*
\v 26 \wj ‘You saw us eating and drinking,’ you’ll start saying, and, ‘You taught along our roads.’\wj*
\v 27 \x + \xo 13:27: \xt Psa 6:8.\x*\wj But he’ll reply to you all, ‘I’ve got no idea where you’re all from, so go away you who do evil deeds.’\wj*
\v 28 \x + \xo 13:28: \xt Mat 22:13; 25:30.\x*\wj There’ll be crying and much anguish when you all see Abraham and Isaak and Yacob and all the prophets in God’s kingdom, but all of you will be being thrown out.\wj*
\v 29 \wj Others will come from the east and the west, and from the north and the south, and \em they\em* will be comfortably seated in God’s kingdom,\wj*
\v 30 \x + \xo 13:30: \xt Mrk 10:31; Mat 19:30; 20:16.\x*\wj so listen: the last \add people\add* will be the first ones, and the first ones will end up last.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua’s concern for Yerusalem
\r (Mat. 23:37-39)
\p
\v 31 At that time, some members of the Pharisee party approached Yeshua and told him, “You need to leave here because Herod wants to kill you.”
\p
\v 32 Yeshua responded, “\wj Go and tell that fox: ‘I’m driving out demons and healing \add people\add* today and tomorrow, but I’ll be finished the following day.’\wj*
\v 33 \wj Yes, I need to keep moving today and tomorrow, because it wouldn’t do for a prophet to come to his end away from Yerusalem.\wj*
\p
\v 34 “\wj Yerusalem, Yerusalem—the city that kills the prophets and throws rocks at those who have been sent to her. How often I wanted to gather your children together like a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you all didn’t want it.\wj*
\v 35 \x + \xo 13:35: \xt Psa 118:26.\x*\wj \add So now,\add* see, your temple will be left \add without a congregation\add*. I’m telling you all that you certainly won’t see me \add again\add* until you say: ‘Blessed is the \add person\add* who comes in the name \add and authority\add* of the \nd master\nd*.’\wj* ”
\c 14
\s1 Yeshua heals a man on a Rest Day
\p
\v 1 One day Yeshua went to the house of one of the Pharisee party leaders for a meal on a Rest Day and they were watching him closely.
\v 2 Then, look, there was a man there with badly swollen limbs.
\v 3 \nd Yeshua\nd* responded \add to the thoughts of\add* the lawyers and Pharisees by asking, “\wj Is it allowable to heal on the Rest Day or not?\wj*”
\p
\v 4 However, they \add just\add* stayed silent, so he took hold of the man and healed him and sent him away.
\v 5 \x + \xo 14:5: \xt Mat 12:11.\x*Then he asked them, “\wj Which of you if your child or your animal fell into a pit wouldn’t immediately pull them out, even if it was a Rest Day?\wj*”
\p
\v 6 But they didn’t have any answer for that.
\s1 Demonstrating humility
\p
\v 7 Then he told a parable to all the invited guests after he’d noticed them choosing the best places around the table, telling them,
\v 8 \x + \xo 14:8-10: \xt Prv 25:6-7.\x*“\wj Whenever you’re invited to a wedding celebration, don’t go and sit in the best place in case someone more important than you might be called over by the host\wj*
\v 9 \wj and then your host might come over to you and ask you to let the other guest sit where you were and then you might end up humiliated at the bottom of the table.\wj*
\v 10 \wj Rather, when you’re invited, sit down at the end so that the host might come and tell you, ‘Friend, move up here to a better spot.’ Then you’ll be honoured in front of all the other guests\wj*
\v 11 \x + \xo 14:11: \xt Mat 23:12; Luk 18:14.\x*\wj because the person who thinks a lot of themself will be humbled, and the person who humbles themself will be honoured.\wj*”
\p
\v 12 Then Yeshua also spoke to the man who had invited him, “\wj Whenever you host a brunch or dinner, don’t invite your friends or siblings, or your \add other\add* relatives or your wealthy neighbours, because they can invite you back and so repay you.\wj*
\v 13 \wj Instead when you’re celebrating, invite the poor and the crippled, the lame and the blind,\wj*
\v 14 \wj and then you’ll be rewarded \add by God\add* because those \add people\add* won’t be able to repay you, hence you’ll be repaid \add instead\add* when those who please God come back to life.\wj*”
\s1 The parable about the reluctant dinner guests
\r (Mat. 22:1-10)
\p
\v 15 Now one of the people at the meal heard all this and commented, “Blessed is anyone who gets to have a meal in God’s kingdom.”
\p
\v 16 But Yeshua responded, “\wj There was a home-owner who was putting on a large dinner and invited many \add people\add*.\wj*
\v 17 \wj When the meal was ready, he sent out his slave to go and tell everyone who’d been invited, ‘Come over now because the food is ready.’\wj*
\v 18 \wj However they all started giving excuses. The first one said, ‘I bought a field and I need to go and inspect it. Please excuse me.’\wj*
\v 19 \wj Another one said, ‘I’ve bought five pairs of oxen and I need to check them out. Please excuse me.’\wj*
\v 20 \wj Yet another said, ‘I just got married so I can’t really come.’\wj*
\v 21 \wj So when the slave got back, he reported all this to his master. The home-owner got angry and told the slave, ‘Well then, hurry out into the roads and streets of the city and bring back the poor and crippled and blind and lame people.’\wj*
\v 22 \wj \add When he’d done that,\add* the slave said, ‘Master, I’ve done what you instructed and there’s still room \add at the table\add*.’\wj*
\v 23 \wj So the master instructed him, ‘Well go along the roads and fences and force them to come so that my house will fill up,\wj*
\v 24 \wj because I’m telling you that none of those invited guests will get a taste of this meal of mine.’\wj* ”
\s1 Count the cost of following Yeshua
\r (Mat. 10:37-38)
\p
\v 25 Large crowds were following Yeshua when he turned and spoke to them,
\v 26 \x + \xo 14:26: \xt Mat 10:37.\x*“\wj If anyone comes to me but doesn’t \add love me more than they love\add* their parents and their siblings, and their spouse and children, and even their own life, then that person is unable to become my follower.\wj*
\v 27 \x + \xo 14:27: \xt Mrk 8:34; Mat 10:38; 16:24; Luk 9:23.\x*\wj Anyone who doesn’t give up everything in this life and come after me is unable to become my follower,\wj*
\v 28 \wj because none of you would want to build a tower without first counting the cost and figuring out if you’ll have enough to complete it.\wj*
\v 29 \wj Otherwise you might lay the foundation and not be able to finish it. Then everyone watching might begin to mock\wj*
\v 30 \wj and say, ‘This person started a building project but wasn’t able to finish it.’\wj*
\v 31 \wj Or what king would go off to war against another king, if he hadn’t previously sat down with his \add generals\add* to figure out if their ten thousand \add soldiers\add* are powerful enough to battle the other king bringing twenty thousand against him?\wj*
\v 32 \wj If they can’t, then while \add the other army\add* is still far away, the king will send ahead a delegation to try to make peace.\wj*
\v 33 \wj So too for every one of you who doesn’t leave behind everything they own, you won’t be able to become a follower of mine.\wj*
\s1 Worthless followers likened to salt
\r (Mark 9:50; Mat. 5:13)
\p
\v 34 “\wj Salt is good, but if it became tasteless, what could you use to make it salty again?\wj*
\v 35 \wj It’d be no use on the soil or for fertiliser—they’d just have to throw it away. Let any person who wants to hear, listen carefully.\wj*”
\c 15
\s1 The lost sheep that was found
\r (Mat. 18:12-14)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 15:1-2: \xt Luk 5:29-30.\x*Many tax-collectors and \add others regarded as\add* sinners had come closer so they could hear what Yeshua \add was teaching\add*,
\v 2 but those from the Pharisee party and the religious teachers were grumbling, “This man accepts sinners and \add even\add* eats with them!”
\v 3 So Yeshua told them this parable:
\p
\v 4 “\wj If you had a hundred sheep and one of them went missing, which of you wouldn’t leave the ninety-nine there in the wilderness and go and search for the missing sheep until you found it?\wj*
\v 5 \wj And once you found it, you would carry it home on your shoulders feeling very happy.\wj*
\v 6 \wj When you got back to the house, \add surely\add* you’d call your friends and neighbours and tell them, ‘Come and celebrate with me because I found my lost sheep.’\wj*
\v 7 \wj I’m telling you all that there’s similar celebration in heaven when one person \add turns from their disobedience and obeys God\add*—more than over ninety-nine guiltless people who have no need to change.\wj*
\s1 The lost coin that was found
\p
\v 8 “\wj Or what woman who had ten silver coins and lost one, wouldn’t light a lamp and sweep the house and search thoroughly until she found it?\wj*
\v 9 \wj Then she’d invite her friends and neighbours saying, ‘Come and celebrate with me because I found the money that I’d lost.’\wj*
\v 10 \wj I’m telling you all that there’s similar celebration by God’s messengers \add in heaven\add* over one person who \add turns from their disobedience and obeys God\add*.\wj*”
\s1 The parable of the returning son
\p
\v 11 Then Yeshua told \add them\add*, “\wj Once there was a man with two sons.\wj*
\v 12 \wj The younger son asked his father to give him his inheritance \add in advance\add*, so the father divided everything up.\wj*
\v 13 \wj Then a few days later, that younger son went off to a distant country where he used his inheritance to enjoy an affluent and carefree lifestyle.\wj*
\v 14 \wj However after he’d used up all his funds, a terrible famine hit that country, and he started to become needy,\wj*
\v 15 \wj so he went and signed up to work for one of the local farmers who assigned him to feed the pigs out in the fields.\wj*
\v 16 \wj As the pigs were eating their carob pods, their food started to look desirable to him, but he wasn’t given any.\wj*
\v 17 \wj But he \add eventually\add* came to his senses and said to himself, ‘Even my father’s workers have plenty of food, but here I am in this place dying of starvation.\wj*
\v 18 \wj I’m going to leave and go \add back\add* to my father to tell him, “Father, I’ve disobeyed \add God\add* and \add dishonoured\add* you\wj*
\v 19 \wj and I’m no longer worthy to be called your son. Take me on as one of your workers.” ’\wj*
\p
\v 20 “\wj So he got up and headed back to his father, but his father saw him coming from a distance and felt sorry for him. He ran and hugged \add his son\add* and kissed him,\wj*
\v 21 \wj and the son said, ‘Father, I’ve disobeyed \add God\add* and \add dishonoured\add* you and I’m no longer worthy to be called your son.’\wj*
\v 22 \wj But the father ordered his slaves, ‘Quickly, bring out the best robe and dress him in it, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.\wj*
\v 23 \wj Then get the grain-fed calf and slaughter it so we can celebrate with a feast,\wj*
\v 24 \wj because my son was dead but he’s now here alive—he was lost but now he’s found.’\wj*
\p
\v 25 “\wj The man’s older son was \add out working\add* in a field, and when he was heading home and got near the house, he could hear \add the sound of\add* music and dancing\wj*
\v 26 \wj so he called out to one of the servants and asked him what was going on.\wj*
\v 27 \wj ‘Your brother has come home,’ he replied, ‘and your father has slaughtered the grain-fed calf \add to celebrate\add* because he got back safely.’\wj*
\v 28 \wj But the \add older\add* son was angry and didn’t want to go in, however his father came out and implored him \add to join them\add*.\wj*
\v 29 \wj ‘Listen,’ said \add the older son\add* to his father, ‘I’ve worked for you for however many years and I’ve never disobeyed you, yet you never gave me even a young goat so that I could celebrate with my friends!\wj*
\v 30 \wj Yet when \em this\em* son of yours comes home after using up your money living with prostitutes, then you slaughter the fattened calf for him!’\wj*
\v 31 \wj ‘Son,’ answered the father, ‘you have always been here with me, and everything I have is yours.\wj*
\v 32 \wj But it’s right to be happy and excited, because your brother was dead and now he’s alive \add again\add*—he was lost and now he’s found.’\wj* ”
\c 16
\s1 The parable about the shrewd manager
\p
\v 1 Yeshua also told this to his followers, “\wj Once there was a rich man who had a manager who worked for him. A whistle-blower reported that the manager had been abusing the owner’s possessions\wj*
\v 2 \wj so the owner called him and asked, ‘What’s this I’m hearing about you? Give back the ledgers because I don’t want you as a manager any more.’\wj*
\v 3 \wj Then the manager thought to himself, ‘\add Oh dear,\add* what will I do now that I’m losing this management job? I’m not \add strong enough to be out\add* digging and I’d be too ashamed to beg.\wj*
\v 4 \wj I know what I’ll do so that when I lose my job, I’ll still be popular with everyone else.’\wj*
\v 5 \wj So he called in each person who owed money to his master. He asked the first one, ‘How much do you owe my master?’\wj*
\v 6 \wj ‘A hundred jugs of olive oil,’ he replied. ‘Well, bring the contract here and change it quickly to fifty,’ the manager said.\wj*
\v 7 \wj Then he asked the next one, ‘How much do you owe?’ ‘A hundred containers of wheat,’ the man replied. ‘Get the contract form and change it to eighty,’ said the manager.\wj*
\v 8 \wj \add When he heard,\add* the landowner praised the dishonest manager for his shrewdness because the modern generation are better at working the system than the children of light in their generation.\wj*
\p
\v 9 “\wj So I’m telling you all to use worldly money to make friends for yourselves, so that whenever it runs out, they’ll accept you all into the eternal homes.\f + \fr 16:9 \ft This sentence is very difficult to understand, so it’s likely that we’re missing some cultural cues here, and in the parable above.\f*\wj*
\v 10 \wj Anyone who’s faithful with a little is also faithful with much, and the person who’s dishonest with a little is also dishonest with a lot.\wj*
\v 11 \wj Because of that, if you aren’t faithful with worldly money, who would entrust true wealth to you all?\wj*
\v 12 \wj If you’re not faithful in your treatment of strangers, who would give you anything for yourselves?\wj*
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 16:13: \xt Mat 6:24.\x*“\wj No household servant can serve two masters, because either they’ll hate the one and love the other, or they’ll support the one and despise the other.\wj*”
\s1 More of Yeshua’s teaching
\r (Mark 10:11-12; Mat. 11:12-13)
\p
\v 14 All those from the Pharisee party were listening carefully because they love money, and they were sneering at Yeshua
\v 15 so he said to them, “\wj You all justify yourselves to the people but God knows your hearts, because what people value most is abhorrent to God.\wj*
\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 16:16: \xt Mat 11:12-13.\x*“\wj The Hebrew scriptures were \add preached\add* until Yohan-the-Immerser started preaching the good message about God’s kingdom, now everyone is striving to get into it,\wj*

\s1 The rich man and Lazarus
\p
\v 19 “\wj Once there was a rich man who dressed like a king and had everything in life to make him happy and content.\wj*
\v 20 \wj At the same time there was a poor \add beggar\add* named Lazarus who was covered in ulcers. He had been carried to the rich man’s gate\wj*
\v 21 \wj \add where he lay\add*, hoping to get any food that might fall off the rich man’s table. The dogs even came and licked his ulcers,\wj*
\v 22 \wj and \add eventually\add* he died and was carried away by \add God’s messengers\add* to \add recline at the table\add* next to Abraham. Then the rich man also died and was buried\wj*
\v 23 \wj and was tormented in hell. However, when he looked up, he saw Abraham in the distance and Lazarus \add reclining next\add* to him\wj*
\v 24 \wj so he called out, ‘Father Abraham, be merciful to me and send Lazarus \add here\add* to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool down my tongue because I’m very distressed \add here\add* in this flame.’\wj*
\v 25 \wj But Abraham replied, ‘Son, don’t forget that you enjoyed the good life while you were alive, whereas Lazarus had it bad, but now he’s here being comforted and you’re suffering.\wj*
\v 26 \wj Anyway, there’s a deep chasm that’s been established between us, so that anyone here who wanted to go to you can’t, nor can anyone from there cross over here to us.’\wj*
\v 27 \wj ‘I have one request then,’ said the man \add who’d been rich\add*. ‘Send Lazarus to my father’s house\wj*
\v 28 \wj because I have five brothers. Then he can warn them about this place of torment so that they won’t also come here.’\wj*
\v 29 \wj ‘They have the scriptures,’ answered Abraham, ‘so they can find out what they say.’\wj*
\v 30 \wj But the man insisted, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone from the dead went to them, then they’d turn from their sins.’\wj*
\v 31 \wj ‘\add Well,\add* if they ignore the scriptures,’ he answered, ‘even if someone from the dead went to them, they still wouldn’t be persuaded.’\wj* ”

\v 1 Then Yeshua told his followers, “\wj It’s impossible that temptations will disappear, but a bad future awaits whoever brings them.\wj*
\v 2 \wj If would be better if that person had a heavy weight tied to them and got thrown into the sea than if they cause a \add younger\add* one to stumble.\wj*

\v 7 “\wj Imagine that you had a slave that was out in the field ploughing or looking after the sheep. When he came back to the house, which of you would tell him, ‘\add The meal’s ready so\add* come in now and sit down to eat.’\wj*
\v 8 \wj No, you’d be saying, ‘Get the meal ready for me and then after you’ve changed, come and wait on me as I eat and drink, then after that you can eat and drink.’\wj*
\v 9 \wj And no, slaves don’t get thanked for just doing what they’ve been told to do.\wj*
\v 10 \wj So too when you all do what you’ve been told to do, just say, ‘We are useless slaves—we’ve just done what we were told.’\wj* ”
\s1 Yeshua heals ten men with skin diseases
\p
\v 11 Soon it was time to continue on towards Yerusalem and so they walked through Galilee and Samaria.
\v 12 In one village, they came across ten men with leprosy, who stood back at a distance
\v 13 and called out, “\nd Yeshua\nd*, master, show mercy to us.”
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 17:14: \xt Lev 14:1-32.\x*When he saw them, Yeshua called back, “\wj Go and ask the priests to inspect you.\wj*” \add So they went off,\add* and as they were walking, they were healed.
\v 15 One of them, seeing that his skin was healed, came back and could be heard loudly praising \nd God\nd*,
\v 16 and he knelt down in front of Yeshua and thanked him. This man was from Samaria.
\v 17 “\wj Weren’t there ten of you that were healed?\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* asked. “\wj Where’s the \add other\add* nine?\wj*
\v 18 \wj Have none of them returned to praise \nd God\nd*—only this foreigner?\wj*”
\v 19 Then he told him, “\wj Get up and go \add now\add*. Your faith has healed you.\wj*”
\s1 God’s kingdom
\r (Mat. 24:23-28,37-41)
\p
\v 20 One time Yeshua was \add approached\add* by some from the Pharisee party and asked when God’s kingdom is coming, and he answered, “\wj The arrival of God’s kingdom is not some visible thing,\wj*
\v 21 \wj and they won’t be shouting, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There it is!’, because you see, God’s kingdom is inside you all.\wj*”
\p
\v 22 Then he told his followers, “\wj The time will come when you’ll be wanting to see humanity’s child \add again\add* even for a day, but you won’t see him.\wj*
\v 23 \wj Some people will tell you all, ‘Look, there he is!’ or ‘Hey, here he is!’ but don’t go looking or following them\wj*
\v 24 \wj because when humanity’s child returns, it’ll be like lightning that flashes from one side of the sky and shines right across to the other side.\wj*
\v 25 \wj However, before that he needs to suffer many things and to be rejected by this generation.\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 17:26: \xt Gen 6:5-8.\x*\wj The time of \add the return of\add* humanity’s child will be just like it was in Noah’s time:\wj*
\v 27 \x + \xo 17:27: \xt Gen 7:6-24.\x*\wj people were eating and drinking, and getting engaged and married right until that day when \nd Noah\nd* went into the barge and the flood came and destroyed everything.\wj*
\v 28 \x + \xo 17:28-29: \xt Gen 18:20–19:25.\x*\wj It was similar in Lot’s time: people were eating and drinking, and buying and selling, and planting and building,\wj*
\v 29 \wj but on the day that Lot walked out of Sodom, fire and sulphur rained down from the sky and destroyed everything.\wj*
\v 30 \wj So that’s how it will be when humanity’s child is revealed.\wj*
\p
\v 31 \x + \xo 17:31: \xt Mrk 13:15-16; Mat 24:17-18.\x*“\wj On that day, anyone who’s just outside the house should not go back in to get their valuables. Similarly, anyone who’s out on the farm shouldn’t return to the house to get \add their possessions\add*.\wj*
\v 32 \x + \xo 17:32: \xt Gen 19:26.\x*\wj Don’t forget \add the disaster that happened to\add* Lot’s wife.\wj*
\v 33 \x + \xo 17:33: \xt Yhn 12:25; Mrk 8:35; Mat 10:39; 16:25; Luk 9:24.\x*\wj Anyone who tries to save their live will lose it, and anyone who’s \add sacrificed\add* their lifestyle, will retain life.\wj*
\v 34 \wj I’m telling you, two \add people\add* will be in one bed on that night and one will be taken and the other one will be left \add behind\add*.\wj*
\v 35 \wj Two \add people\add* will be preparing food at the same place and one will be taken and the other one will be left \add behind\add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 36 ◘
\v 37 “Where \add will this happen\add*, \nd master\nd*,” they asked.
\p “\wj Where the body is,\wj*” he answered, “\wj that’s where the vultures will be gathering.\wj*”
\c 18
\s1 Persistence in prayer
\p
\v 1 Then he told them another parable because it’s good to always be praying and not to be discouraged:
\v 2 “\wj Once there was a city judge who didn’t revere \nd God\nd* and nor did he allow anyone to sway him.\wj*
\v 3 \wj Now there was a widow in that city, and she \add kept\add* going to him saying, ‘Get me justice against my rival.’\wj*
\v 4 \wj At first, he wasn’t interested in the case, but eventually he said to himself, ‘Even if I don’t fear \nd God\nd* and I’m not \add easily\add* pushed around by anyone,\wj*
\v 5 \wj this widow is making trouble for me. I’ll fight her case for her so she’ll stop harassing me.’\wj* ”
\p
\v 6 Then the \nd master\nd* continued, “\wj Listen to what the ungodly judge is saying\wj*
\v 7 \wj and won’t \nd God\nd* also bring justice for his chosen \add people\add* when they call out to him day and night? He’ll patiently \add listen to\add* them.\wj*
\v 8 \wj I’m telling you that he’ll quickly bring justice \add to the situation\add*. However, when humanity’s child comes, will he find faith on the earth?\wj*”
\s1 Humility in prayer
\p
\v 9 Then Yeshua also told this parable to some who felt that they were guiltless before God because of their own \add goodness\add*, and so they scorned others:
\v 10 “\wj Once two men went into the temple to pray—one was a Pharisee party member and the other was a tax-collector.\wj*
\v 11 \wj The Pharisee stood there praying quietly, ‘I thank you, \nd God\nd*, that I’m not like the rest of the people: swindlers, sinners, adulterers, and even that tax-collector.\wj*
\v 12 \wj I fast twice a week and I give a tenth of everything I get.’\wj*
\v 13 \wj But the tax-collector stood at a distance, not even willing to raise his head, instead beating his chest and saying, ‘\nd God\nd*, I’m a sinner, take away my guilt.’\wj*
\v 14 \x + \xo 18:14: \xt Mat 23:12; Luk 14:11.\x*\wj I’m telling you all that this man went home after being declared guiltless, not the other one, because all those who praise themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be praised.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua blesses small children
\r (Mark 10:13-16; Mat. 19:13-15)
\p
\v 15 The people also brought \add their\add* babies to Yeshua so that he would touch them \add and bless them\add*, but \add his\add* apprentices scolded them when they saw it.
\v 16 However, \nd Yeshua\nd* called out to them, “\wj Let the little children come to me. Don’t stop them because God’s kingdom \add consists\add* of those like them.\wj*
\v 17 \wj I can assure you that anyone who doesn’t accept God’s kingdom like a little child, certainly won’t be able to enter it.\wj*”
\s1 The wealthy leader
\r (Mark 10:17-31; Mat. 19:16-30)
\p
\v 18 One time a \add local\add* leader asked Yeshua, “Good teacher, what do I need to do to gain eternal life?”
\p
\v 19 “\wj Why do you call me good?\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* responded. “\wj No one is good other than \nd God\nd* himself.\wj*
\v 20 \x + \xo 18:20: a \xt Exo 20:14; Deu 5:18; \xo b \xt Exo 20:13; Deu 5:17; \xo c \xt Exo 20:15; Deu 5:19; \xo d \xt Exo 20:16; Deu 5:20; \xo e \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16.\x*\wj You know \add God’s\add* commandments: Don’t commit adultery, don’t murder, don’t steal, don’t lie in court, and honour your parents.\wj*”
\p
\v 21 “I’ve obeyed all of those since I was young,” the leader replied.
\p
\v 22 “\wj Then you’re lacking \add only\add* one more thing,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* added. “\wj Sell everything you own and distribute the money to the poor, then you’ll have treasure in the heavens. Then come and follow me.\wj*”
\v 23 But when he heard this, \add the man\add* was very upset because he was extremely wealthy.
\p
\v 24 As \nd Yeshua\nd* looked at him, he said, “\wj It’s so difficult for those who’re wealthy to enter into God’s kingdom—\wj*
\v 25 \wj it’s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to enter God’s kingdom.\wj*”
\p
\v 26 Those \add around\add* who heard asked, “Then who’s able to be saved?”
\p
\v 27 “What’s humanly impossible,” he replied, “is \add quite\add* possible with \nd God\nd*.”
\p
\v 28 Peter spoke up, “Hey, \em we\em* left everything and followed you!”
\p
\v 29 “\wj I can assure you all,\wj*” Yeshua responded, “\wj that no one who left their home or spouse or siblings, or parents or children on account of God’s kingdom\wj*
\v 30 \wj will not be repaid many times over in this age as well as gaining eternal life in the coming age.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua predicts his execution a third time
\r (Mark 10:32-34; Mat. 20:17-19)
\p
\v 31 Then taking the twelve \add aside\add*, Yeshua told them, “\wj Listen, we’re about to go down to Yerusalem and everything that the prophets wrote about humanity’s child will soon happen.\wj*
\v 32 \wj He’ll be handed over to non-Jews and will be mocked and insulted and spat on,\wj*
\v 33 \wj then they’ll flog him and kill him, but he’ll come back to life on the third day.\wj*”
\p
\v 34 But they didn’t understand any of that—\add the meaning of\add* this statement was hidden from them and they didn’t realise what was being said.
\s1 Yeshua heals a blind man
\r (Mark 10:46-52; Mat. 20:29-34)
\p
\v 35 As Yeshua got close to the city of Yericho, there was a blind man sitting beside the road begging.
\v 36 When he heard a crowd passing through, he started asking what was going on
\v 37 and they told him that \nd Yeshua\nd* from \nd Nazareth\nd* was passing by,
\v 38 so he started shouting, “\nd Yeshua\nd*, David’s descendant, be merciful to me!”
\p
\v 39 Some of the people walking past him told him to be quiet, but he just shouted louder, “David’s descendant, be merciful to me!”
\p
\v 40 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* stopped and ordered that the man be brought \add across\add* to him. When he came, he asked him,
\v 41 “\wj What do you want me to do for you?\wj*”
\p He answered, “\nd Master\nd*, I want to be able to see!”
\p
\v 42 “\wj Then receive your sight,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* said, “\wj because your faith has healed you.\wj*”
\p
\v 43 Immediately he was able to see and followed along after Yeshua praising God, and the people that saw it \add happen also\add* praised God.
\c 19
\s1 Zacchaeus hosts Yeshua
\p
\v 1 After that, Yeshua entered Yericho and continued walking through it.
\v 2 Then, look, there was a man named Zacchaeus and he was a chief tax-collector and pretty wealthy.
\v 3 He wanted to see who \add this\add* \nd Yeshua\nd* was, but couldn’t see over the crowd because he was rather short
\v 4 so he ran along ahead \add of the crowd\add* and climbed a sycamore tree so that he could see Yeshua as he walked past.
\v 5 However, as \nd Yeshua\nd* came to that place, he looked up and said, “\wj Zacchaeus, hurry up and get down because I think it would be good to stay at your place.\wj*”
\v 6 So he hurried down \add the tree\add* and happily welcomed him.
\p
\v 7 But everyone who had observed it was grumbling, “\add Hoy,\add* he’s going to stay with a sinful man.”
\p
\v 8 \add At dinner,\add* Zacchaeus stood and said to the master, “Listen, master, I’m giving half of everything I own to the poor, and anyone that I defrauded, I’ll pay them back four times over.”
\p
\v 9 “\wj Salvation came to this home today,\wj*” responded \nd Yeshua\nd*, “\wj as this man has also \add shown that\add* he’s Abraham’s offspring\wj*
\v 10 \x + \xo 19:10: \xt Mat 18:11.\x*\wj because humanity’s child came to look for those who’re lost and save them.\wj*”
\s1 The parable about three servants
\r (Mat. 25:14-30)
\p
\v 11 Then Yeshua went on to tell a parable to those who heard all that because he was getting near to Yerusalem and they had assumed that God’s kingdom was going appear straight away.
\v 12 Because of that, he told them, “\wj Once a man of high status was going to a distant country to inherit a kingdom, and then to return \add after that\add*.\wj*
\v 13 \wj So he called his ten slaves and gave them ten silver coins and told them to put them to work until he got back.\wj*
\v 14 \wj But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation out to him to say, ‘We don’t want this man to reign over us.’\wj*
\p
\v 15 “\wj But he received his kingdom and then he headed back and sent for those slaves that he had given the silver to, to find out how \add well\add* they’d traded.\wj*
\v 16 \wj The first slave arrived and said, ‘Master, I used your silver coin to earn ten more coins.’\wj*
\v 17 \wj ‘Well done good slave,’ he said, ‘and because you were faithful with a little, I’ll put you in charge of ten cities.’\wj*
\v 18 \wj Then the second \add slave\add* came and said, ‘Your silver master, gained five more coins.’\wj*
\v 19 \wj ‘You too,’ \add the master\add* said, ‘will be put in charge of five cities.’\wj*
\v 20 \wj Then another \add slave\add* came and said, ‘Master, look, here’s your silver that I kept hidden away wrapped in a handkerchief\wj*
\v 21 \wj because I was scared of you, knowing that you’re a hard man—picking up what you didn’t put down, and harvesting where you didn’t sow.’\wj*
\v 22 \wj ‘I’ll judge you by your own words,’ \add the master\add* said, ‘you evil slave! You knew that I’m a hard man, picking up what I didn’t put down, and harvesting what I didn’t sow.\wj*
\v 23 \wj So why didn’t you take my silver to the bank? Then went I returned, at least I would have been able to collect some interest.’\wj*
\v 24 \wj Then \add the master\add* told the others who were standing there, ‘Take the silver coin away from him and give it to the \add slave\add* who has the ten.’\wj*
\v 25 \wj But they protested, ‘Master, he already has ten coins.’\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 19:26: \xt Mrk 4:25; Mat 13:12; Luk 8:18.\x*\wj ‘I’m telling you all,’ \add the master replied,\add* ‘that everyone who has, will be given \add more\add*, but the person who doesn’t have, even what they have will be taken away \add from them\add*.\wj*
\v 27 \x + \xo 19:11-27: \xt Mat 25:14-30.\x*\wj However, \add about\add* those enemies of mine who didn’t want me to reign over them: bring them here and strike them down in front of me.’\wj* ”
\s1 Yeshua rides an unbroken colt into Yerusalem
\r (Yhn 12:12-19; Mark 11:1-11; Mat. 21:1-11)
\p
\v 28 After he’d said that, Yeshua continued on towards Yerusalem
\v 29 and as he got near to Bethfage and Bethany going towards the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his followers ahead,
\v 30 telling \add them\add*, “\wj Go on to the next village, and when you enter it, you’ll see a colt that’s never been ridden tied up there. Untie it and bring it \add here\add*.\wj*
\v 31 \wj But if anyone asks you why you’re untying it, tell them that the \nd master\nd* needs it.\wj*”
\p
\v 32 So they went off and found it just like he’d told them,
\v 33 and when they were untying the colt, the owners asked them, “Why are you untying the colt?”
\p
\v 34 “The \nd master\nd* needs it,” they answered.
\v 35 \nd So\nd* they led it back to \nd Yeshua\nd*, and after throwing \add some of\add* their clothes over it, they mounted him on it.
\v 36 Then as the colt moved along, they spread \add more of\add* their clothes on the road.
\p
\v 37 As he was about to descend down the slope of the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of followers started celebrating and loudly praising \nd God\nd* for all the miracles that they had seen,
\v 38 \x + \xo 19:38: \xt Psa 118:26.\x*saying, “The coming king has been blessed in the name of the \nd master\nd*. \add May there be\add* peace in heaven and brilliant splendour up high there.”
\p
\v 39 There were some members of the Pharisee party in the crowd and they suggested to him, “Teacher, tell your followers to stop!”
\p
\v 40 “\wj I’m telling you,\wj*” Yeshua answered, “\wj that if all of these people stayed silent then the stones would start shouting.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua cries over Yerusalem
\p
\v 41 As Yeshua got closer to Yerusalem, he cried over it,
\v 42 saying, “\wj If only you knew how to obtain peace today, but it’s been hidden from your eyes,\wj*
\v 43 \wj because in the future, your enemies will surround you and build a palisade around you and attack you from every side.\wj*
\v 44 \wj Then they’ll level you and your children along with you, and they’ll topple the stone \add walls and buildings\add*, because you didn’t realise \add the importance of\add* who was visiting you.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua throws the traders out of the temple
\r (Yhn 2:13-22; Mark 11:15-19; Mat. 21:12-17)
\p
\v 45 Then Yeshua went into the temple and started throwing out the traders,
\v 46 \x + \xo 19:46: \xt Isa 56:7; Jer 7:11.\x*telling them, “\wj It’s been written that ‘my house will be a place of prayer,’ but you all have made it into a den for robbers.\wj*”
\p
\v 47 \x + \xo 19:47: \xt Luk 21:37.\x*After that, he taught in the temple every day, but the chief priests and the religious teachers were looking for a way to execute him,
\v 48 but they didn’t come up with a plan because all the people loved to listen to him.
\c 20
\s1 The leaders challenge Yeshua’s authority
\r (Mark 11:27-33; Mat. 21:23-27)
\p
\v 1 One day when Yeshua was teaching the people in the temple and preaching the good message, the chief priests and religious teachers and the local \add elders\add* came to him
\v 2 and demanded, “Tell us what authority you have to do those things, and who gave it to you!”
\p
\v 3 “\wj \add Well,\add* I’ll also ask you all a question,\wj*” he responded.
\v 4 “\wj When Yohan immersed people, was \add he instructed\add* from heaven or was it just some person’s idea?\wj*”
\p
\v 5 They discussed this among themselves, reasoning, “If we say ‘from heaven’, then he’ll ask us why we didn’t believe \add that God sent him\add*.
\v 6 But if we say ‘from people’, then all the people will kill us with rocks, because they believe that Yohan was a prophet.”
\v 7 So they answered, “We don’t know where \add his teaching\add* came from.”
\p
\v 8 “\wj \add Well, then,\add*\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* told them, “\wj nor will I tell you where I get the authority to do these things.\wj*”
\s1 The parable about killing the owner’s son
\r (Mark 12:1-12; Mat. 21:33-46)
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 20:9: \xt Isa 5:1.\x*Then Yeshua started telling this parable to the people: “\wj Once a man planted a vineyard and rented it out to tenant farmers before heading off on his trips.\wj*
\v 10 \wj At the appropriate time of the year, he sent a slave to the tenants to collect his percentage of the profits, but they beat up the slave and sent him back empty-handed.\wj*
\v 11 \wj So he sent another slave, but they also beat that one and dishonoured him, then sent him back empty-handed.\wj*
\v 12 \wj So the man sent a third slave, and they also wounded this one and threw him out \add the gate\add*.\wj*
\v 13 \wj So the master of the vineyard asked \add himself\add*, ‘What will I do now? \add Ah,\add* I’ll send my dear son—perhaps they’ll be swayed by him.’\wj*
\v 14 \wj But when the tenants saw the son, they reasoned among themselves, ‘This is the heir. If we kill him, then \add his\add* inheritance will become ours.’\wj*
\v 15 \wj So they threw him out \add the gate\add* and killed him.\wj*
\p \wj So then, what will the master of the vineyard do to them?\wj*
\v 16 \wj He will go \add to the vineyard\add* and destroy those tenant farmers, and will \add lease\add* the vineyard out to others.\wj*”
\p They people listening looked at Yeshua and said, “Surely that could never happen.”
\p
\v 17 \x + \xo 20:17: \xt Psa 118:22.\x*But he looked them \add in the eyes\add* and asked, “\wj Then what is this statement that was written \add in the scriptures\add*:\wj*
\q1 \wj ‘The stone which the builders rejected,\wj*
\q1 \wj that one became the \add most important\add* stone.’\wj*
\m
\v 18 \wj Everyone who falls onto that stone will be shattered, but whoever that stone falls on will be pulverised.\wj*”
\s1 The question about paying tax
\r (Mark 12:13-17; Mat. 22:15-22)
\p
\v 19 Then because the religious teachers and the chief priests knew that Yeshua had used that parable to speak about them, they tried at the time to capture him, but couldn’t because they were afraid of the \add number of\add* people \add around\add*.
\v 20 So after watching Yeshua closely, they sent agents who pretended to be \add genuine inquirers\add* so that they could catch him out on some \add careless\add* statement and then they could hand him over to the rule and authority of the \add Roman\add* governor.
\v 21 They asked him, “Teacher, we know that you say what is right, and that you teach the truth about God’s way without \add being influenced\add* by people.
\v 22 \add So tell us,\add* should we pay tax to the \add Roman\add* emperor or not?”
\p
\v 23 But having observed their craftiness, he said to them,
\v 24 “\wj Show me a coin. Whose image and inscription is on it?\wj*”
\p “The emperor’s,” they replied.
\v 25 “\wj So then,\wj*” Yeshua continued, “\wj Give the emperor what belongs to him, and what belongs to God, give to God.\wj*”
\p
\v 26 So they weren’t able to catch him out by making a \add treasonable\add* statement in front of the people—in fact they were stunned by his answer and didn’t ask anything else.
\s1 The question about the resurrection
\r (Mark 12:18-27; Mat. 22:23-33)
\p
\v 27 \x + \xo 20:27: \xt Acts 23:8.\x*Then some from the Sadducee sect came. They claim there’s no resurrection, and they asked Yeshua,
\v 28 \x + \xo 20:28: \xt Deu 25:5.\x*“Teacher, Mosheh wrote for us that if anyone’s married brother should die childless, then the \add surviving\add* brother should take \add in\add* the widow so they can produce children in the \add deceased\add* brother’s \add name\add*.
\v 29 Once there were seven brothers and the first one had a wife but died without having children.
\v 30 Then the second \add brother\add*
\v 31 and the third took her, right through to the seventh, and without leaving any children, they all \add eventually\add* died.
\v 32 Finally, the woman also died.
\v 33 So when they’re resurrected, which brother will she be the wife of, because all seven had her as their wife?”
\p
\v 34 \nd Yeshua\nd* answered them, “\wj This generation get engaged and married,\wj*
\v 35 \wj but in the \add next\add* age, those who’re considered worthy to be brought back to life from the dead won’t get engaged or marry,\wj*
\v 36 \wj because they can’t die again, but rather they’re like \add God’s\add* messengers and are God’s children, being children of the resurrection.\wj*
\v 37 \x + \xo 20:37: \xt Exo 3:6.\x*\wj But about the dead being raised, Mosheh revealed it at the \add burning\add* thorn bush when he called \nd Yahweh\nd* the god of Abraham and of Isaac and of Yacob,\wj*
\v 38 \wj so \nd God\nd* is not the \nd god\nd* of the dead, but of the living, because to him everyone is living.\wj*”
\p
\v 39 “Teacher, you answered well,” some of the religious teachers affirmed,
\v 40 and no one dared to ask him anything else after that.
\s1 How can the messiah be David’s descendant?
\r (Mark 12:35-37; Mat. 22:41-46)
\p
\v 41 Then Yeshua asked them, “\wj How can \add the experts\add* say that the \nd messiah\nd* is a descendant of \add King\add* David,\wj*
\v 42 \x + \xo 20:42-43: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*\wj because David said in his songs:\wj*
\q1 \wj ‘The master said to my master,\wj*
\q1 \wj Sit here on my right\wj*
\q1
\v 43 \wj until I cause your enemies to be defeated.’\wj*

\v 44 \wj So if David calls \add the messiah his\add* \nd master\nd*, how can he \add also\add* be his descendant?\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua warns about the religious teachers
\r (Mark 12:38-40; Mat. 23:1-36)
\p
\v 45 While all the people were still listening, Yeshua told his followers,
\v 46 “\wj Watch out for the religious teachers who enjoy walking around in their robes and love the greetings they get in the marketplaces and the best seats in the meeting halls and the best places at the dinners,\wj*
\v 47 \wj but they take advantage of widows’ homes and they make their prayers long to impress others. These people will receive a harsher judgement.\wj*”
\c 21
\s1 The widow’s sacrificial offering
\r (Mark 12:41-44)
\p
\v 1 When Yeshua looked up, he saw some wealthy people throwing their gifts into the \add temple\add* treasury \add basket\add*.
\v 2 He \add also\add* noticed a poor widow who threw in two small copper coins.
\v 3 “\wj I can assure you all,\wj*” he said, “\wj that this poor widow threw more in than all the others,\wj*
\v 4 \wj because they all donated out of their plentiful wealth, but she in her poverty, gave her \add food budget\add*.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua predicts the destruction of the temple
\r (Mark 13:1-2; Mat. 24:1-2)
\p
\v 5 Meanwhile, some were talking about the temple building that had been constructed with beautifully cut stones and dedicated with promises to God, but Yeshua said,
\v 6 “\wj In the future, all of this that you’re all looking at, will be torn down in such a way that not one of those stones will be left sitting on top of another.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua foretells signs and persecution
\r (Mark 13:3-13; Mat. 24:3-14)
\p
\v 7 Then they asked Yeshua, “Teacher, when will those things all happen, and what will be the sign that they’re about to happen?”
\p
\v 8 “\wj Be careful,\wj*” he answered, “\wj in case you all get deceived, because lots of people will come using my name and saying, ‘I’m him,’ or ‘The time has come.’ Don’t follow after them,\wj*
\v 9 \wj and whenever you all hear about wars and disturbances, don’t be terrified, because all these things do need to happen first, but they don’t mean that the end will be right then.\wj*”
\p
\v 10 Then he told them, “\wj Various countries and kingdoms will attack each other\wj*
\v 11 \wj and there’ll be huge earthquakes, and famines and diseases and other frightening events, as well as widespread signs from the sky.\wj*
\p
\v 12 “\wj But before all that happens, they’ll be arresting you all, and persecuting you. You’ll be handed over to the meeting halls and prisons. \add Some of you\add* will be stood in front of kings and governors because of my name\wj*
\v 13 \wj \add but\add* it will turn out to be a way to tell them \add about me\add*.\wj*
\v 14 \x + \xo 21:14-15: \xt Luk 12:11-12.\x*\wj So be confident that you all don’t need to figure out in advance what you will say in your defence\wj*
\v 15 \wj because I’ll give you the words to say and wisdom which all of those opposing you won’t be able to resist or speak against.\wj*
\v 16 \wj But you’ll also be turned in even by parents and siblings, \add other\add* relatives and friends, and some of you will be \add sentenced\add* to death.\wj*
\v 17 \wj You all will be hated by everyone because of my name,\wj*
\v 18 \wj but it’s certain that not a single hair on your head will \add be lost\add*,\wj*
\v 19 \wj \add but\add* by your endurances, you’ll \add actually\add* be gaining your lives.\wj*
\s1 Yeshua foretells Yerusalem’s destruction
\r (Mark 13:14-19; Mat. 24:15-21)
\p
\v 20 “\wj However, when you all see Yerusalem being surrounded by armies, then you’ll know that \add the time of\add* her abandonment is close.\wj*
\v 21 \wj Then those who’re in Yudea should flee to the hills and those in the central area should get out, and foreigners should no longer go there\wj*
\v 22 \x + \xo 21:22: \xt Hos 9:7.\x*\wj because that will be a time of vengeance when what’s been written will come to pass.\wj*
\v 23 \wj It’ll be so hard for pregnant and breast-feeding women at that time because there’ll be incredible distress in the country and severe anger towards the \add Jewish\add* people.\wj*
\v 24 \wj They’ll be cut down with swords and taken to many other countries as slaves, then Yerusalem will be overrun by non-Jews until the times \add given to\add* the non-Jews will be fulfilled.\wj*
\s1 The return of humanity’s child
\r (Mark 13:24-27; Mat. 24:29-31)

\v 26 \wj People will faint from fear and worry about what’s happening to the planet, because the powers in the universe\f + \fr 21:26 \ft This could possibly be referring to a shake-up of spiritual powers, but more likely refers to the physical universe from our moon and solar system outwards.\f* will be shaken.\wj*
\v 27 \x + \xo 21:27: \xt Dan 7:13; Rev 1:7.\x*\wj Then they’ll see humanity’s child coming \add down\add* in a cloud with power and great brightness.\wj*
\v 28 \wj But when these things start to happen, stand straight and look upwards, because your new lives of freedom will be about to begin.\wj*”
\s1 Recognising the end by the season
\r (Mark 13:28-31; Mat. 24:32-35)
\p
\v 29 Then he told them a parable: “\wj Watch the fig tree and all the trees.\wj*
\v 30 \wj Whenever you see shoots start appearing, you know that summer is not far away.\wj*
\v 31 \wj Similarly when you all see those things starting to happen, you will know that God’s kingdom is close.\wj*
\p
\v 32 “\wj I can assure you all that that generation certainly won’t pass away until all those events \add come to an end\add*.\wj*
\v 33 \wj The sky and the earth will pass away, but my statements will certainly not pass away.\wj*
\s1 Stay alert and pray
\p
\v 34 \wj Watch your own lives in case you end up focused on partying and drunkenness and day-to-day living, because then that sudden end might snap on you\wj*
\v 35 \wj like an animal trap, because it will hit everyone all over the planet.\wj*
\v 36 \wj No matter what the season, stay alert, asking \add God\add* that you’ll all have the strength to escape all those things going to happen, and \add at the end to be able\add* to stand in front of humanity’s child.\wj*”
\p
\v 37 \x + \xo 21:37: \xt Luk 19:47.\x*Then Yeshua was teaching in the temple during the day, but he’d leave in the evening and go and stay on the Mount of Olives,
\v 38 but all the people would return to the temple \add again the next day\add* at dawn to listen to him again.
\c 22
\s1 The plan to kill Yeshua
\r (Yhn 11:45-53; Mark 14:1-2; Mat. 26:1-5)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 22:1: \xt Exo 12:1-27.\x*By then the \it Flat Bread Celebration\it* was getting closer—part of the Passover celebrations,
\v 2 and the chief priests and the religious teachers were trying to find a way to kill Yeshua \add without causing the people to riot\add*.
\s1 Yudas agrees to betray Yeshua
\r (Mark 14:10-11; Mat. 26:14-16)
\p
\v 3 Then Satan entered Yudas Iscariot, one of the twelve \add apprentices\add*.
\v 4 He left \add the others\add* and went to the chief priests and \add their\add* officers to discuss a way that he could turn Yeshua over to them.
\v 5 They were very pleased and decided to give him some silver,
\v 6 so agreeing to that, he \add started\add* looking for an opportunity to turn Yeshua over to them \add sometime when he wasn’t surrounded by\add* a crowd.
\s1 Yeshua organises their Passover dinner
\r (Yhn 13:21-30; Mark 14:12-21; Mat. 26:17-25)
\p
\v 7 Then the day of the flat bread dinner arrived when the Passover celebration is observed.
\v 8 Yeshua sent Peter and Yohan, telling them, “\wj Go on ahead and prepare our Passover meal ready for us to eat.\wj*”
\p
\v 9 “Where should we prepare it?” they asked.
\v 10 “\wj Listen,\wj*” he said, “\wj go ahead and when you enter the city you’ll meet a man carrying a pitcher of water. Follow him into the house that he goes into.\wj*
\v 11 \wj Then tell the home-owner that the teacher wants to know where the guest room is so that he can eat the Passover meal with his followers\wj*
\v 12 \wj and he’ll show you a large upper room that’s already set-up. \add That’s where\add* you should prepare \add the meal\add*.\wj*”
\v 13 So \add the two of them\add* went on \add ahead\add* and found it \add exactly\add* like he’d told them, and so they prepared the Passover \add dinner\add*.
\s1 The cups and the bread at dinner
\r (Mark 14:22-26; Mat. 26:26-30; 1 Cor. 11:23-25)
\p
\v 14 When it was time to eat, Yeshua and his apprentices sat down \add together\add*
\v 15 and he told them, “\wj I’ve been really looking forward to eating this passover dinner with you all before my time of suffering begins,\wj*
\v 16 \wj because I’m telling you that I certainly won’t eat it \add again\add* until it’s fulfilled in God’s kingdom.\wj*”
\p
\v 17 Then when the \add wine\add* cup was passed to him, he gave thanks and said, “\wj Take this and share it among yourselves,\wj*
\v 18 \wj because I’m telling you that after this, I won’t drink the product of the vines \add again\add* until God’s kingdom comes.\wj*
\p
\v 19 Then picking up \add some\add* bread and giving thanks, he broke the bread \add apart\add* and gave it to them saying, “\wj This is my body which is being given for you all. Do this when you remember me.\wj*”
\v 20 \x + \xo 22:20: \xt Jer 31:31-34.\x*Similarly with the cup \add of wine\add* that comes after they’ve eaten, he said, “\wj This cup is the new agreement in my blood which will be poured out for you all.\wj*
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 22:21: \xt Psa 41:9.\x*“\wj However, the one who will turn me in is sitting with me at the table.\wj*
\v 22 \wj Now, humanity’s child has to endure what’s been \add previously\add* designated, but on the other hand, it won’t end well for the man who turns him in.\wj*”
\s1 The apprentices argue about being the greatest
\p
\v 23 This \add got them\add* debating among themselves about which one of them it might be who was going to do that
\v 24 \x + \xo 22:24: \xt Mrk 9:34; Mat 18:1; Luk 9:46.\x*and it soon turned into a dispute between them about which one of them was the greatest,
\v 25 so Yeshua said, “\wj In other countries, the kings are the master over the people and they call themselves ‘benefactors’ of those they have authority over.\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 22:26: \xt Mrk 9:35; Mat 23:11.\x*\wj But all of you shouldn’t be like that, but rather the greatest one of you should become like the youngest, and the one who leads you all should become like the servant.\wj*
\v 27 \x + \xo 22:27: \xt Yhn 13:12-15.\x*\wj Because who is greater: the one on the couch, or the one who’s serving? Isn’t it the one on the couch? But among all of you, I’m like the one serving\wj*
\v 28 \wj and you all are the ones who have stuck with me even in my trials.\wj*
\p
\v 29 “\wj And I’m making an agreement with you (just like my father agreed that the kingdom would be mine),\wj*
\v 30 \x + \xo 22:30: \xt Mat 19:28.\x*\wj so that you all will be able to eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you’ll sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel.\wj*
\s1 Yeshua predicts Peter’s denial
\r (Yhn 13:36-38; Mark 14:27-31; Mat. 26:31-35)
\p
\v 31 “\wj Simon, Simon, Satan has requested to sift you all like wheat \add grains\add*,\wj*
\v 32 \wj but I interceded for you that your faith wouldn’t fail and that once you turn back again, you’ll strengthen your brothers.\wj*”
\p
\v 33 “\nd Master\nd*,” Simon responded, “I’m prepared to go to prison with you, or even to die.”
\p
\v 34 “\wj I can tell you, Peter,\wj*” replied Yeshua, “\wj that the rooster certainly won’t crow today until you’ve gone and three times denied even knowing me.\wj*”
\s1 Take a wallet, backpack, and sword now
\p
\v 35 \x + \xo 22:35: \xt Mrk 6:8-9; Mat 10:9-10; Luk 9:3; 10:4.\x*Then Yeshua told them, “\wj When I sent you all out without a wallet or backpack or spare sandals, did you have to go without anything?\wj*”
\p “Nothing,” they answered.
\p
\v 36 “\wj But now,\wj*” Yeshua continued, “\wj if you have a wallet, take it and same with a backpack. If you don’t have a sword, sell your coat and buy one,\wj*
\v 37 \x + \xo 22:37: \xt Isa 53:12.\x*\wj because it was written that ‘he was considered to be a lawbreaker’ and I’m telling you all that everything that was written about me, will be fulfilled and \add my time here\add* is soon about to end.\wj*
\p
\v 38 “\nd Master\nd*,” they said, “we’ve got two swords here.”
\p “\wj That’s plenty,\wj*” he replied.
\s1 Yeshua prays in the garden
\r (Mark 14:32-42; Mat. 26:36-46)
\p
\v 39 Then leaving the \add upper room\add*, he went to the Mount of Olives as usual and his apprentices followed him.
\v 40 When they got to the place, he told them, “\wj \add You all\add* pray that you won’t \add give\add* in to temptation.\wj*”
\p
\v 41 Then he went on several metres, and kneeling \add on the ground\add*, he prayed,
\v 42 “\wj Father, if you want, \add allow me to avoid this suffering\add*, however, I want to do what you want—not \add just\add* what I want.\wj*”
\v 43 ◘
\v 44 ◘
\p
\v 45 Then standing again after praying, he went \add back\add* to the apprentices and found that they’d fallen asleep from the sorrow
\v 46 and he asked them, “\wj Why are you all sleeping? Sit up and pray that you won’t \add give\add* in to temptation.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua is arrested at night
\r (Yhn 18:3-11; Mark 14:43-50; Mat. 26:47-56)
\p
\v 47 While he was still speaking, wow, a crowd \add turned up\add* with Yudas \add Iscariot\add* in the front, and he went up to \nd Yeshua\nd* to kiss him.
\v 48 But \nd Yeshua\nd* asked him, “\wj Yudas, are you turning in humanity’s child with a kiss?\wj*”
\p
\v 49 When the other apprentices around Yeshua saw what was about to happen, they asked, “\nd Master\nd*, should we attack with our swords?”
\v 50 Then one of them slashed at the chief priest’s slave and sliced off his right ear.
\p
\v 51 “\wj That’s gone far enough!\wj*” countered \nd Yeshua\nd*, and touching \add the side of \add* the man’s head, he healed him.
\p
\v 52 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* spoke to those who had come to capture him—the chief priests and temple officers and the local elders, “\wj So you all came out here with swords and clubs as if I was a robber?\wj*
\v 53 \x + \xo 22:53: \xt Luk 19:47; 21:37.\x*\wj I was there in the temple with you all everyday and yet you didn’t arrest me \add there\add*. Yes, because this is your time: with the power of the darkness.\wj*”
\s1 Peter denies knowing Yeshua
\r (Yhn 18:12-18,25-27; Mark 14:53-54,66-72; Mat. 26:57-58,69-75)
\p
\v 54 Then after capturing Yeshua, they led him along to the chief priest’s house, but Peter followed them from a distance.
\v 55 \add The staff at the chief priest’s place\add* had lit a fire to sit around in the middle of the courtyard, and Peter \add slipped in\add* with them.
\v 56 Then a servant girl noticed him in the light, and peering at him she said, “This man was with him as well.”
\p
\v 57 But Peter disowned him, saying, “Woman, I don’t \add even\add* know him.”
\p
\v 58 A little while later, someone else noticed him and said, “You’re also one of them!”
\p “Man, I’m not!” Peter retorted.
\p
\v 59 About an hour later, someone else insisted on saying, “This fellow was definitely with him because he’s also a Galilean!”
\p
\v 60 “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” Peter responded, and while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
\p
\v 61 Just then the master turned and looked at Peter, and he \add suddenly\add* remembered what the master had said, “\wj Before the rooster crows today, three times you’ll deny \add even\add* knowing me.\wj*”
\v 62 Then Peter went out \add of the courtyard\add* and cried \add like a baby\add*.
\s1 Yeshua is mocked and beaten
\r (Mark 14:65; Mat. 26:67-68)
\p
\v 63 \add Meanwhile\add* the \add officers\add* who were holding Yeshua started mocking him and beating him.
\v 64 They blindfolded him and then challenged him, “Prophesy and tell us who just slapped you!”
\v 65 as well as saying many other things to insult him.
\s1 Yeshua’s brief interrogation by the Jewish council
\r (Yhn 18:19-24; Mark 14:55-64; Mat. 26:59-66)
\p
\v 66 As the daylight came, the council of local elders including both the chief priests and the religious teachers, gathered together and Yeshua was led in to the council
\v 67 who demanded, “If you’re the \nd messiah\nd*, tell us so.”
\p “\wj Even if I told you,\wj*” he replied, “\wj you certainly wouldn’t believe me,\wj*
\v 68 \wj and if I asked you all anything, you certainly wouldn’t answer.\wj*
\v 69 \wj But from now on, humanity’s child will be sitting in the seat of power at God’s right \add hand\add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 70 “So then, you \em are\em* God’s son!” they all reacted.
\p “\wj \add Well,\add* you’re all saying that I am,\wj*” he said.
\p
\v 71 “Why would we need any more witnesses than this?” they asked, “because we heard it \add ourselves\add* straight out of his mouth.”
\c 23
\s1 Yeshua is taken to Pilate
\r (Yhn 18:28-38; Mark 15:1-5; Mat. 27:1-2,11-14)
\p
\v 1 Then the whole group of \add Jewish leaders\add* stood up and led him to Pilate
\v 2 where they started to bring their accusations, “We found this man perverting our nation and telling the people not to pay taxes to Caesar. He calls himself the \nd messiah\nd* and claims to be a king.”
\p
\v 3 “Are you the king of the Jews,” Pilate asked him?
\p “\wj You’re the one saying it,\wj*” Yeshua answered.
\p
\v 4 Then Pilate told the chief priests and the crowds, “I can’t find anything that this man is guilty of.”
\p
\v 5 But they \add kept\add* insisting, “He’s been stirring up the people, teaching throughout all Yudea. He started in Galilee then worked his way all the way down here.”
\s1 Yeshua is taken to Herod
\p
\v 6 When Pilate heard that, he asked if the prisoner was a Galilean,
\v 7 and when he discovered that he was from \add King\add* Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him across to Herod as he also happened to be in Yerusalem at that time.
\v 8 Herod was very pleased when he saw Yeshua \add being brought in\add* because he’d been wanting to see him for quite some time because of everything he’d heard about him. He was hoping to see Yeshua do a miracle \add in front of his eyes\add*
\v 9 and asked him lots of questions, but Yeshua didn’t answer any of them.
\v 10 Meanwhile the chief priests and the religious teachers were standing there loudly making many accusations against him.
\v 11 Then Herod and his soldiers also insulted and mocked Yeshua, and dressing him in posh clothes, \add Herod\add* sent him back to Pilate.
\v 12 After that day, Herod and Pilate became friends with each other. (Before then they’d opposed each other.)
\s1 The innocent prisoner sentenced to death
\r (Yhn 18:39–19:16; Mark 15:6-15; Mat. 27:15-26)
\p
\v 13 So Pilate called together the chief priests and the local leaders and the people
\v 14 and told them, “You brought this man to me for stirring up the people, but listen, I’ve examined him in front of you all and I find him to be not guilty of anything that you’re all accusing him of,
\v 15 and Herod didn’t either, because he \add just\add* sent him back to us. Now listen, he’s done nothing worthy of a death sentence
\v 16 so I’ll have him disciplined and then discharged.
\p
\v 17 ◘
\v 18 But they all yelled out in unison, “Take him away and release Barabbas instead!”
\v 19 (Barabbas had been thrown into prison for murder after an uprising that had occurred in the city.)
\p
\v 20 Pilate called out again to them wanting to release \nd Yeshua\nd*
\v 21 but they kept yelling, “Execute him on a stake! Execute him on a stake!”
\p
\v 22 He tried a third time, “But what crime has this man committed? I’ve found nothing worthy of the death sentence, so I’ll discipline him and then release him.”
\p
\v 23 But they kept loudly insisting that he be executed on a stake, and the yelling \add of the crowd was strong enough\add* to convince Pilate,
\v 24 so he conceded to their request
\v 25 and released the one thrown into prison for murder and rebellion, but he conceded \add to sentence\add* \nd Yeshua\nd* as they had wanted.
\s1 Yeshua is hung on a pole
\r (Yhn 19:17-27; Mark 15:21-32; Mat. 27:32-44)
\p
\v 26 As \add the Roman soldiers\add* led Yeshua \add out of the city\add*, they grabbed a man that was coming in from the countryside. He was Simon from Cyrene, and they \add forced\add* him to carry the stake and follow along behind Yeshua.
\p
\v 27 Following along behind them, was a large crowd of people including women who were wailing for Yeshua and \add chanting sad songs\add*,
\v 28 but he turned to them and spoke, “\wj Women of Yerusalem, don’t weep for me. Weep for yourselves and for your children,\wj*
\v 29 \wj because the time is coming when they’ll say, ‘Blessed are the childless couples and the women who never bore or raised a child.’\wj*
\v 30 \x + \xo 23:30: \xt Hos 10:8; Rev 6:16.\x*\wj Then they’ll start being the mountains to fall on top of them and begging the hills to smother them,\wj*
\v 31 \wj because if this what happens \add while we’re still a nation\add*, what will happen \add when the country is gone\add*?\wj*”
\p
\v 32 There were also two other criminals being led along to be executed with Yeshua.
\p
\v 33 When they got to the place named ‘The Skull’, they attached Yeshua onto a stake\f + \fr 23:33 \ft Luke doesn’t state whether or not the stake had a cross-piece (which would then form a cross or a T).\f* and the same for the \add two\add* criminals, one on each side of him,
\v 34 \x + \xo 23:34: \xt Psa 22:18.\x*but when they divided his clothes, \add the soldiers\add* threw dice \add to divide them up\add*.
\p
\v 35 \x + \xo 23:35: \xt Psa 22:7-8.\x*The people observing were standing there, and some of the \add Jewish\add* leaders were there too, sneering at him and saying, “He saved others, so now if he’s God’s son, the chosen \nd messiah\nd*, let him save himself.”
\p
\v 36 The soldiers also mocked him, going up and offering cheap wine to him,
\v 37 saying, “If you’re the king of the Jews, then save yourself,”
\v 38 as an inscription had been placed above him that said, “This is the king of the Jews.”
\p
\v 39 One of the criminals that was hanging there insulted him, saying, “Aren’t you the \nd messiah\nd*? Save yourself and us \add too\add*.”
\p
\v 40 But the other \add criminal\add* told him off, saying, “Don’t you even respect \nd God\nd* when you \add too have been sentenced to death.\add*
\v 41 At least we deserve our punishment that fits what we’ve done, but in contrast, this \add man\add* did nothing wrong.”
\v 42 Then he said, “\nd Yeshua\nd*, remember me when you enter your kingdom.”
\p
\v 43 “\wj I can assure you,\wj*” he replied, “\wj that you’ll be with me in paradise today.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua’s death
\r (Yhn 19:28-30; Mark 15:33-4; Mat. 27:45-56)
\p
\v 44 By then it was around midday but it went dark until around 3pm—
\v 45 \x + \xo 23:45: \xt Exo 26:31-33.\x*the sun went dark\f + \fr 23:45 \ft Although the Greek word ‘ἐκλιπόντος’ (eklipontos, a different word from what was used in the previous verse) might suggest a natural eclipse, this is impossible for a few reasons, particularly that these events occurred around Passover which coincides with the full moon when an eclipse is physically impossible, and also because an eclipse only lasts a few minutes, not hours.\f* and the curtain inside the temple was torn in the middle.
\v 46 \x + \xo 23:46: \xt Psa 31:5.\x*Then \nd Yeshua\nd* called out loudly, “\wj Father, I’m entrusting my \nd spirit\nd* into your care.\wj*” and after saying that, he stopped breathing.
\p
\v 47 When the centurion saw how it happened, he praised \nd God\nd* saying, “This really was an innocent man.”
\p
\v 48 The crowd of people who’d gathered for the spectacle, after seeing what happened they returned \add to the city\add*, beating their chests \add in sorrow\add*.
\v 49 \x + \xo 23:49: \xt Luk 8:2-3.\x*Yeshua’s acquaintances had stood further back, along with the women who have accompanied him from Galilee, and they \add too\add* saw it \add all\add*.
\s1 The body placed in a tomb
\r (Yhn 19:38-42; Mark 15:42-47; Mat. 27:57-61)
\p
\v 50 Then, look, there was a man named Yosef on the local council. (He was a good man and godly,
\v 51 and hadn’t agreed with what the council had decided and done. He was from the Jewish city of Arimathea and was waiting for God’s kingdom \add to come\add*.)
\v 52 He went in to see Pilate and requested \nd Yeshua’s\nd* body,
\v 53 then he took it down \add from the stake\add* and wrapped it in some linen cloth, and put the body into a tomb hollowed into the rock—a \add new\add* tomb that had never been used.
\v 54 It was now the day of preparation and the Rest Day was about to begin.
\p
\v 55 The women who’d come from Galilee followed \add Yosef and his men\add* and saw the tomb and how the body was placed inside,
\v 56 \x + \xo 23:56: \xt Exo 20:10; Deu 5:14.\x*then they returned \add to the house\add* and prepared spices and ointments.
\s1 The empty tomb
\r (Yhn 20:1-10; Mark 16:1-8; Mat. 28:1-10)
\p Once the Rest Day began, they \add all\add* rested according to the commandment,
\c 24
\nb
\v 1 but as soon as it dawned on Sunday morning, they went back to the tomb taking the prepared spices.
\v 2 There they discovered that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance
\v 3 and when they went in, the body of the \nd master Yeshua\nd* wasn’t there.
\v 4 While they were still there puzzling about what might have happened, two men in dazzling clothes approached them.
\v 5 The women were scared, \add and knelt down\add* and bowed with their faces close to the ground, but the men asked them, “Why are you looking for the living in the \add place of\add* the dead?
\v 6 \x + \xo 24:6-7: \xt Mrk 8:31; 9:31; 10:33-34; Mat 16:21; 17:22-23; 20:18-19; Luk 9:22; 18:31-33.\x*He’s not here—he’s been brought back to life. Remember how he spoke to you all when you were still in Galilee
\v 7 and he said, ‘\wj It’s necessary that humanity’s child is handed over to sinful people, and to be executed on a stake, and then to \add come back to life\add* on the third day.’\wj* ”
\v 8 Then indeed they remembered his words.
\p
\v 9 Then they left the tomb and went back \add into the city\add* and reported all this to the eleven apprentices and all the others.
\v 10 (The women who told this to the missionaries were Maria from Magdala, Yoanna, Maria the mother of Yacob, and the other women who were with them.)
\v 11 However those who heard it, thought it was all just nonsense and didn’t believe them.
\v 12 But Peter stood up and ran off to the tomb, and when he stooped down \add to look in\add*, he could only see the linen cloths, so he wandered off by himself, wondering what could have happened.
\s1 Yeshua joins the walkers to Emmaus
\r (Mark 16:12-13)
\p
\v 13 Then, wow, two of \add Yeshua’s followers\add* were \add walking\add* to the village of Emmaus about eleven kilometres away from Yerusalem,
\v 14 and they were discussing with each other about all the recent events.
\v 15 After talking and debating for a while, \nd Yeshua\nd* \add caught up with\add* them and joined them,
\v 16 but their eyes were restricted from being able to recognise him.
\v 17 He asked them, “\wj What’s all this that you two are talking about while you walk?\wj*”
\p They stopped \add suddenly\add* and looked at him with sad faces,
\v 18 and the one called Cleopas asked him, “Are you the only visitor staying in Yerusalem who doesn’t know what just happened in the last few days?”
\p
\v 19 “\wj What happened?\wj*” he asked.
\p “What happened to the man, \nd Yeshua\nd* from \nd Nazareth\nd*,” they answered. “He was a prophet who did powerful miracles and delivered a powerful message in front of \nd God\nd* and all the people.
\v 20 The chief priests and our rulers handed him over to be sentenced to death, and he was executed on a stake.
\v 21 We were hoping that he was going to be the one who would release Israel \add from the grip of the Romans\add*, but all that happened three days ago now.
\v 22 Then some of our women also surprised us, because they went to his tomb \add very\add* early \add this morning\add*
\v 23 but they couldn’t find his body. Then they came back and told us about some vision about messengers \add from God\add* who apparently said that he’s alive.
\v 24 Some of our companions went out to the tomb and found it just as the women had said, but they didn’t see \add anyone\add*.”
\p
\v 25 “\wj Oh, you’re so foolish,\wj*” he told them, “\wj and your hearts are so reluctant to believe everything that the prophets wrote.\wj*
\v 26 \wj Didn’t the \nd messiah\nd* need to suffer all of that in order to be able to enter into all his greatness?\wj*”
\v 27 Then starting with Mosheh and going through all the prophets, he explained the scriptures to them concerning what had been written about him there.
\p
\v 28 As they got close to the village they were going to, he seemed to be going on further
\v 29 but they urged him, “Come and stay with us because it’s almost evening and there’s not much daylight left.”
\v 30 Then when they were ready to eat, he picked up the bread and blessed it, and then he broke it and handed it out to them,
\v 31 and then their eyes were opened and they recognised him. Just then he vanished,
\v 32 and they said to each other, “Weren’t our hearts burning when he was speaking to us on the road and explaining the scriptures to us?”
\p
\v 33 That very hour they \add packed up and\add* headed back to Yerusalem where they found that the eleven and the others with them had gathered together
\v 34 saying, “The \nd master\nd* really has come back to life—he was seen by Simon \add Peter\add*!”
\p
\v 35 Then the two explained what had happened on the road and how they’d recognised them when he broke the bread.
\s1 The showing of Yeshua of followers din
\r (Yhn 20:19-23; Mark 16:14-18; Mat. 28:16-20; Acts 1:6-8)
\p
\v 36 As they were still talking about these things, Yeshua himself \add suddenly\add* was there standing in the room and greeted them, “\wj Peace to you all.\wj*”
\p
\v 37 However, they got a fright, and then were terrified thinking that it was a spirit.
\v 38 Then he spoke to them \add again\add*, “\wj Why are you all upset, and why are you thinking such stuff?\wj*
\v 39 \wj Look at my hands and feet and you’ll see that it’s me. Touch me and look, because spirits don’t have solid bodies like you can see that I have.\wj*”
\p
\v 40 Then he showed them his hands and his feet.
\v 41 Some of them, still not believing, had a mixture of happiness and doubt, and he asked them, “\wj Have you got anything here to eat?\wj*”
\v 42 They handed him a piece of broiled fish,
\v 43 and he took it and ate it in front of them.
\p
\v 44 Then he told them, “\wj While I was still with you all, I told you those messages of mine, and how that everything written about me by Mosheh and the prophets and in the songs, it’s all going to be fulfilled.\wj*”
\v 45 Then he opened their minds to be able to understand the scriptures, and he told them,
\v 46 “\wj It was written that the \nd messiah\nd* would suffer and to come back to life on the third day,\wj*
\v 47 \wj and that his name will be proclaimed \add as the authority\add* to forgive the sins \add of the people\add* when they repent—\add people\add* from every country beginning \add here\add* in Yerusalem.\wj*
\v 48 \wj You all are witnesses of all that.\wj*
\v 49 \x + \xo 24:49: \xt Acts 1:4.\x*\wj \add Soon\add* I’ll be sending out the \add one\add* that my father promised to you all, but \add meanwhile\add* you must remain \add here\add* in the city until you all get clothed in power that comes from heaven.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua is lifted up into the sky
\r (Mark 16:19-20; Acts 1:9-11)
\p
\v 50 \x + \xo 24:50-51: \xt Acts 1:9-11.\x*Then Yeshua led them \add out of the city\add* as far as Bethania where he lifted up his \add arms\add* and blessed them.
\v 51 While he was still blessing them, he passed \add over the top of them\add* and was lifted up into the sky.
\v 52 They lay face-down on the ground \add in worship\add* of him, \add then got up and\add* feeling very happy, they returned to Yerusalem
\v 53 where they went into the temple and praised \nd God\nd* about everything.
