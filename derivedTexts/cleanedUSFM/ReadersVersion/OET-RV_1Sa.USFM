\is1 Introduction
\ip This document tells about the people of the nation of Yisrael (called ‘Israel’ in older Bibles) at the time when Shemuel (commonly, but wrongly known as ‘Samuel’) was still their teacher through to when Sha’ul (commonly, but wrongly known as ‘Saul’) led them as their first king. It also reveals the reasons why Sha’ul lost his position as king and why God promised to replace him with David.
\ip Long ago before Yisrael had a king, the people regarded their God as their ruler, but eventually they came to the point of asking God to give them a king to lead them. Both the king and the people were subject to God’s leading and expected to obey God’s laws.
\ip The main theme of this document is showing how peace and prosperity came when the people obeyed God, and if not, it could lead to destruction. And then sometimes God used his people to apply his discipline to other people groups. It pays to note what’s written in 2:30 that goes, “I will honour those who honour me, but those who despise me will be side-lined.”

\s1 Elkanah and family at Shiloh
\p
\v 1 There was a man named Elkanah from Ramatayim-Zofim \add who lived\add* in the Efraimite hill country. (He was an Efraimite—the son of Yeroham, son of Elihu,\x + \xo 1:1 \xt 1 Chr. 6:27,34.\x* son of Tohu, son of Zuf.)
\v 2 He had two wives: Hannah (who had no children) and Peninnah (who had \add several\add* children).
\p
\v 3 \add Every year\add* he would \add take his family\add* to Shiloh to \add offer sacrifices\add* to commander Yahweh. Eli was Yahweh’s priest there, and his two sons Hofni and Pinehas \add also served there\add*.
\p
\v 4 on the day that Elkanah made his sacrifice, he would give portions \add of the cooked meat\add* to Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters,
\v 5 \add but\add* he’d give a double portion to Hannah because he loved \add her\add*, \add even though\add* Yahweh had \add not enabled her to have children\add*.
\v 6 Then her rival would provoke her and \add try to make her angry\add*, because Yahweh hadn’t \add given her children\add*.
\v 7 And so it \add happened every year\add*. Every time they went to Yahweh’s \add tent\add*, \add Peninnah\add* ridiculed him, and \add Hannah\add* would weep and wouldn’t eat.
\v 8 Then Elkanah would \add ask\add* her, “Hannah, why are you crying? And why aren’t you eating? And why \add are you so upset\add*? Isn’t it better \add having me\add* than \add having\add* ten sons?”
\s1 Hannah and Eli
\p
\v 9 \add One time\add* Hannah got up after eating and drinking at Shiloh. (Eli the priest was sitting on the seat near the entrance of Yahweh’s \add tent\add*.)
\v 10 \add Hannah\add* \add was very upset\add*, and she prayed to Yahweh and wept uncontrollably.
\v 11 Then she made a vow, saying, “Commander Yahweh, if you \add would only notice the misery\add* of your female servant and remember me. Don’t \add ignore\add* \add me\add*. \add Help\add* your female servant \add to give birth to a son\add*, then I’ll give him to \add you\add* \add for his entire\add* life, and \add he’ll never have his hair cut\add*.”\x + \xo 1:11: \xt Num 6:5.\x*
\p
\v 12 As she continued praying to Yahweh, Eli was watching her mouth.
\v 13 \add Now\add* Hannah was \add praying from her heart\add*, and her lips were moving \add but she wasn’t speaking aloud\add*. Eli thought \add she must be\add* drunk,
\v 14 and \add scolded\add* her, “You shouldn’t be getting drunk. Get rid of your wine.”
\p
\v 15 “No, my master,” Hannah replied, “I’m a woman \add who’s suffering deep down\add*. I haven’t drunk any wine or intoxicating drink, \add but rather\add* I’ve been \add sharing my inner issues\add* with Yahweh.
\v 16 Don’t think that your female servant is \add just\add* a worthless woman, because just now I was \add praying as a result of my terrible anguish and frustration\add*.”
\p
\v 17 “\add Then\add* go in peace,” Eli replied. “And may Yisrael’s God grant your request that you \add presented to\add* him.”
\p
\v 18 “\add Please assume the best of\add* your female servant,” said \add Hannah\add*, then she went on her way and \add had something to eat\add*, and \add something had changed in her demeanor\add*.
\s1 Shemu’el’s birth and dedication
\p
\v 19 They \add all\add* gut up early the \add next\add* morning and worshipped Yahweh \add again\add*, then they returned to their home at Ramah. Then Elkanah \add slept with\add* his wife Hannah, and Yahweh \add answered her prayer\add*.
\v 20 \add Hannah\add* got pregnant, and in due course, she gave birth to a son. She named him ‘Shemu’el’ \add (meaning ‘heard by God’, usually changed to ‘Samuel’ in English)\add* because she had requested him from Yahweh.
\p
\v 21 \add At the usual time,\add* Elkanah and all his household went \add to Shiloh\add* to \add offer their sacrifices and fulfill their vows\add* to Yahweh.
\v 22 \add But\add* Hannah \add didn’t accompany them\add* because she’d told her husband, “I’ll \add come and\add* bring him when he’s weaned. Then he can be \add taken in to\add* Yahweh and \add permanently\add* remain there.”
\v 23 “Do \add what you think’s best\add*,” her husband \add replied\add*. “Stay until you’ve weaned him. May Yahweh \add do whatever he said\add* \add to you\add*.” \add So\add* \add she\add* stayed \add behind\add* and breastfed her son until she \add eventually\add* weaned him.
\p
\v 24 \add The next year,\add* after she’d weaned him, she took the young boy with \add them\add*, along with three bulls, a \add sack\add* of flour, and a \add container\add* of wine. Then she brought him to Yahweh’s \add tent\add* in Shiloh,
\v 25 and after slaughtering the bull, they took the boy in to Eli.
\v 26 “Please, my master,” \add Hannah\add* said. “As your spirit lives, my master, I’m the woman who was standing with you here to pray to Yahweh.
\v 27 I prayed \add that Yahweh would give me a son, and he did, and this is him\add*.
\v 28 Also, I dedicated him to Yahweh all his life, so he’s now given to Yahweh.”
\p Then \add they\add* worshipped Yahweh there.

\s1 Hannah’s praise
\q1
\v 1 Then Hannah prayed, saying,\x + \xo 2:1-10: \xt Luk 1:46-55.\x*
\q1 “\add I’m so happy with\add* Yahweh.
\q1 My strength comes from Yahweh.
\q1 I can \add loudly refute\add* my enemies.
\q1 Because I’m \add so pleased that you rescued me\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 2 No one \add else\add* is holy like Yahweh.
\q1 There’s certainly no one else who’s like you.
\q1 No one else \add is like a\add* rock \add to me\add* like our God is.
\q1
\v 3 You all shouldn’t speak so proudly.
\q1 \add Don’t\add* let arrogance come out of your mouths.
\q1 Because Yahweh is a God of knowledge,
\q2 and all actions are weighed by him.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Warriors have their bows shattered,
\q1 but those who stumbled \add are given extra\add* strength.
\q1
\v 5 Those who had been satisfied \add now\add* hire themselves out for food,
\q2 but the hungry people \add no longer lack\add*.
\q1 The woman who’d been childless, gives birth to seven,
\q2 but the woman with many sons \add is depressed\add*.
\q1
\v 6 Yahweh puts to death and he makes alive.
\q1 He sends down to the grave and brings up.
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh makes poor and makes rich.
\q1 He humbles, and he also honours.
\q1
\v 8 He lifts the poor up from the dust,
\q1 and lifts up the needy from the ash heap
\q1 so they can sit with influential \add people\add*
\q1 and be given the seat of honour.
\q1 The earth’s foundations belong to Yahweh—
\q1 he was the one who placed the world on top of them.
\q1
\v 9 He \add watches over\add* those who are loyal to him,
\q1 but wicked \add people\add* will die in the darkness,
\q2 because \add we\add* don’t succeed through our own strength.
\q1
\v 10 It’s Yahweh who shatters our enemies.
\q1 He thunders against \add them\add* from the heavens.
\q1 Yahweh will judge the \add entire\add* earth,
\q1 and will give strength to the king,
\q1 and will \add give victory\add* to his chosen one.”
\p
\v 11 Then Elkanah \add and his family\add* returned to \add their\add* home in Ramah, but young Shemuel \add stayed to\add* help Eli the priest serve Yahweh.
\s1 Eli’s greedy sons
\p
\v 12 \add Now\add* Eli’s sons were \add worthless scoundrels\add* who didn’t obey Yahweh.
\v 13 It was the custom of those priests that when anyone was offering a sacrifice and as soon as the meat was boiling, the priest’s servant would come along holding a three-pronged fork
\v 14 and stick it into the pot or pan. The priest would then \add claim\add* whatever the fork brought up. That’s what they did to all the Israelis who came to Shiloh \add to offer sacrifices\add*.
\v 15 Also, before the fat \add was removed to\add* burn, the priest’s servant would say to the person sacrificing, “Give some meat to the priest—he doesn’t want just boiled meat \add all the time\add*—he’ll take some raw meat \add as well\add* to roast.”
\p
\v 16 But if the person tried to say, “Once the fat has all been burnt, then take whatever you want for yourself,” then he’d \add assert\add*, “No, you’d better give it \add right\add* now or I’ll take it by force.”
\v 17 And \add so\add* the actions of those young men were very wicked in Yahweh’s mind because they \add just\add* treated sacrifices to Yahweh with contempt.
\s1 Young Shemuel starts serving at Shiloh
\p
\v 18 \add By now\add* Shemuel was serving Yahweh, dressed in a priestly uniform made from linen.
\v 19 \add Each year\add* his mother would make a small robe for him and bring it when she came with her husband to offer \add their sacrifices\add*.
\v 20 Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “May Yahweh \add give more children for you through\add* this woman in place of the \add boy\add* \add dedicated\add* to Yahweh.” Then they’d return home.
\p
\v 21 \add So\add* Yahweh visited Hannah and she went on to give birth to three \add other\add* sons and two daughters. \add Meanwhile,\add* \add young\add* Shemuel \add grew up serving\add* Yahweh.
\s1 Eli and his children
\p
\v 22 \add Now\add* Eli was very old and he had heard all about what his sons were doing to the Israeli people, and \add also\add* that they were sleeping around with the women who worked at the sacred tent entrance.
\v 23 “Why are you \add two\add* doing all these things that I keep hearing about—these evil things \add affecting\add* all those people?” he \add asked\add* them.
\v 24 “No, my sons. The reports that I keep hearing Yahweh’s people passing on aren’t good!
\v 25 If someone sins against a person, then God will mediate for him, but if someone sins against Yahweh, who will \add speak up\add* for that person?” \add But\add* they wouldn’t listen to their father’s advice because Yahweh wanted to put them to death.
\p
\v 26 \add Meanwhile\add* the boy Shemuel was growing \add up\add*, and his good \add behaviour pleased\add* both Yahweh and \add the people\add*.\x + \xo 2:26: \xt Luk 2:52.\x*
\s1 The prophecy against Eli’s family
\p
\v 27 \add One day\add* one of God’s \add prophets\add* came to Eli and told him, “This is what Yahweh says, ‘Did\add n’t\add* I clearly reveal myself to your ancestors when they were Far’oh’s \add slaves\add* in Egypt?
\v 28 And out of all the Israeli tribes, I chose \add your ancestor\add* to be a priest to me, to go up on my altar, to burn incense, \add and\add* to \add wear the sacred apron in front of me\add*. Plus I gave your ancestors \add the rights to\add* all the burnt offerings made by the \add Israelis\add*.\x + \xo 2:28: a \xt Exo 28:1-4; \xo b \xt Lev 7:35-36.\x*
\v 29 Why do you \add disrespect\add* sacrifices and offerings that I commanded \add the people\add* to bring to me \add at my residence\add*. And \add why do\add* you honour your sons more than me by fattening yourselves from the best of every offering of my people Yisrael?’
\p
\v 30 “Therefore, this is what Yahweh the God of Yisrael declares: ‘I indeed said \add your ancestors and then your descendants\add* would \add serve me forever\add*.’ But now \add I declare this\add* \add instead\add*: ‘\add This cannot continue\add* because I will honour those who honour me, but those who despise me will be \add side-lined\add*.
\v 31 Listen, the time is coming when I’ll \add bring you and your relatives to an end—none of your men will die of old age\add*
\v 32 and you’ll see distress in my residence. I’ll do good for \add the rest of\add* Yisrael, but there’ll never be another old man in your home.
\v 33 I won’t \add finish\add* them off near my altar. Your eyes will fail and you’ll grieve \add inside\add*, but your \add adult sons\add* will die.
\v 34 This will be the sign: it’ll \add turn out\add* that your two sons Hofni and Finehas will both die on the same day.\x + \xo 2:34: \xt 1Sam 4:11.\x*
\v 35 Then I’ll \add select\add* another man to be a faithful priest to me—he’ll \add follow my desires and do what’s in my mind\add*. I’ll make \add him and his faithful descendants to continue and to always serve me\add*.
\v 36 Any of your descendants who remain \add alive\add* will have to go to him to request food and money and \add beg\add* for some priestly work to earn \add something to eat\add*.’ ”
\c 3
\s1 Yahweh calls Shemuel
\p
\v 1 \add Meanwhile young\add* Shemuel was serving Yahweh \add under\add* Eli. In those days, Yahweh rarely \add spoke to the people or sent visions\add*.
\p
\v 2 \add By that time,\add* Eli’s \add sight was very poor\add*—he could barely see. \add One night when\add* he was sleeping in his place,\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Some translations use ‘room’ here instead of ‘place’, but it could easily be that he had a small bed in a corner somewhere.\f*
\v 3 and Shemuel was lying down in Yahweh’s tent (where the box was that contained the \add stone slabs\add*), \add but\add* God’s lamp was still burning.
\v 4 Yahweh called out to Shemuel, and he \add called back\add*, “I’m here. \add Coming.\add*”
\v 5 Then he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.”
\p “I didn’t call,” he said. “Go back \add and\add* lie down.” \add So\add* he went \add back\add* and laid down.
\p
\v 6 Yahweh called again, “Shemuel.”
\p Shemuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.”
\p “I didn’t call, my son,” he said, “Go back \add and\add* lie down.”
\p
\v 7 (\add At this point\add*, Shemuel didn’t \add really\add* know Yahweh, because Yahweh hadn’t revealed \add himself\add* to him before.)
\v 8 Then Yahweh called Shemuel a third time. He got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, because you called me.”
\p Then Eli realised that it was Yahweh who was calling the boy
\v 9 and he told Shemuel, “Go \add and\add* lie down. Then if he calls to you \add again\add*, \add just answer\add*, ‘Speak, Yahweh, because your servant is listening.’ ” \add So\add* Shemuel went and laid down \add again\add* in his place.
\p
\v 10 Then Yahweh came and \add stood nearby\add* and called \add like he’d done the other\add* times, “Shemuel, Shemuel.”
\p “Speak,” Shemuel said, “because your servant is listening.”
\p
\v 11 “Listen,” Yahweh told \add him\add*, “I’m about to do something in Yisrael that \add will make everyone’s ears tingle when they hear it\add*.
\v 12 \add When it happens\add*, I’ll \add do everything that I’ve said about Eli and his family\add*, from the beginning to the end.
\v 13 I’ve told him \add already\add* that I’m about to \add eternally\add* judge his \add household\add* because \add he knew about the evil that was being done\add*, because his sons were \add bringing curses on\add* themselves and he didn’t scold them.
\v 14 That’s why I’ve promised Eli’s \add family\add* that \add their\add* disobedience can \add never\add* be forgiven by means of sacrifices or offerings.
\s1 Shemuel tells Eli what Yahweh said
\p
\v 15 Then Shemuel lay down \add again\add* until the morning when he opened the doors of Yahweh’s house \add as usual\add*, \add but\add* \add he\add* was scared to tell Eli about the vision.
\v 16 \add But\add* Eli called \add him\add*, “Shemuel, my son.”
\p “Here I am,” he \add answered\add*.
\p
\v 17 “What did he tell you?” \add Eli\add* \add asked\add*. “Don’t hide it from me. May God \add punish you severely\add* if you hide a \add single\add* word from \add everything\add* he told you.”
\v 18 \add So\add* Shemuel told him \add everything\add* without hiding anything. Then Eli \add answered\add*, “It’s Yahweh. May he do \add whatever he thinks best\add*.”
\p
\v 19 \add As\add* Shemuel grew up, Yahweh was with him and nothing he said failed to happen,
\v 20 \add so\add* all Yisrael from Dan \add in the north\add* and as far as Beer-Sheva \add in the south\add* knew that Shemuel was a faithful prophet of Yahweh.
\v 21 \add Over time,\add* Yahweh continued to appear in Shiloh and to reveal \add his plans through\add* Shemuel
\c 4
\nb
\v 1 and Shemuel’s messages went to all Yisrael.
\s1 The capture of the box with the agreement
\p \add At that time,\add* Yisrael went to war against the Philistines. They camped at Eben-Ezer and the Philistines camped at Afek.
\v 2 Then the Philistines lined up to meet Yisrael and the battle spread. Yisrael was defeated by the Philistines and they killed about 4,000 warriors in the battle line in the countryside.
\v 3 \add As\add* the people\f + \fr 4:3 \ft It seems that most translations assume that this is referring to the remainder of the warriors staggering back into the camp (which is certainly a possibility), but we’ve interpreted it as the people coming together (with their elders as it says), to try to figure out why they were defeated. (Similarly for v4.)\f* came into the camp, the \add Israeli\add* elders \add asked\add* \add themselves\add*, “Why did Yahweh \add allow the Philistines to slaughter\add* us today? Let’s get the box from Shiloh that contains \add the stone slabs with\add* Yahweh’s agreement \add on them\add*. \add Once it’s amongst us\add*, \add surely\add* it’ll save us from \add defeat by\add* our enemies.”
\v 4 \add So\add* the people sent \add men\add* to Shiloh and from there they lifted the box containing Yahweh’s agreement \add and the sacred platform\add* with the winged creatures.\f + \fr 4:4 \ft And with Commander Yahweh sitting on, above, or between them.\f* Eli’s two sons, Hofni and Finehas, were there with the box containing God’s agreement.\x + \xo 4:4: \xt Exo 25:22.\x*
\p
\v 5 \add As\add* the box with Yahweh’s agreement \add was carried\add* into the camp, all the \add Israelis\add* shouted so loud that the ground shook.
\v 6 When the Philistines heard the \add noise\add*, they said, “What’s that loud shout in the Hebrews’ camp?” Then they realised that the box \add with Yahweh’s covenant\add* had come into their camp
\v 7 and they were afraid saying, “A god has come into the \add Israeli\add* camp.” Then they said, “\add This means trouble\add*, because it wasn’t like this yesterday \add or the previous days\add*.
\v 8 \add Oh dear\add*! Who will rescue us from these mighty gods? Those are the gods who struck the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.
\v 9 Now we Philistines \add really need to fight with passion\add*, because if we don’t, we’ll ending up serving the Hebrews just like they’ve had to serve us. \add Now, gather your courage and fight for your lives\add*.”
\p
\v 10 \add So\add* the Philistines fought \add hard\add*, and Yisrael was \add defeated\add*. \add Many warriors fled back to their tents\add* and it was a \add terrible\add* slaughter—30,000 foot soldiers from Yisrael were killed.
\v 11 \add As well as that,\add* the box with God’s \add agreement\add* was taken, and Eli’s two sons Hofni and Finehas were killed.
\s1 The death of Eli
\p
\v 12 A Benyamite man ran from the battle line back to Shiloh that day. His clothes were torn and \add he was covered in dirt\add*.
\v 13 \add When\add* he arrived \add there\add*, Eli was sitting on a roadside seat watching, because he was \add very concerned\add* about the \add sacred chest\add*. As the man entered the city with the news, all the \add people\add* started \add wailing loudly\add*.
\v 14 \add As\add* Eli heard the wailing, he \add asked\add*, “\add What’s that big commotion\add*?” \add So\add* the man ran over to Eli to \add tell him the news\add*.
\v 15 \add At that time\add*, Eli was ninety-eight years old, and he \add stared straight ahead\add* because he couldn’t see.
\v 16 The man told \add him\add*, “I’m the one who’s \add just\add* come from the battle line. I \add had to\add* fled from the battle line today.”
\p “What was the issue, my son?” \add Eli\add* \add asked\add*.
\p
\v 17 “Yisrael fled \add defeated\add* from the Philistines,” said the messenger. “And also, there has been a terrible slaughter of our people. \add What’s more\add*, your two sons, Hofni and Finehas, \add were killed\add*, and the \add sacred chest has been captured\add*.”
\p
\v 18 \add The moment\add* he mentioned the capturing of God’s box, \add Eli\add* fell backwards off the seat beside the city gate. Because he was old and \add very\add* heavy, his neck broke and he died. Eli had \add led\add* Yisrael for forty years.
\s1 The death of Finehas’ widow
\p
\v 19 \add Now\add* Finehas’ wife (\add Eli’s\add* daughter-in-law) was pregnant—about to give birth—\add when\add* she heard the news about the \add sacred chest\add* being taken, and that \add both\add* her father-in-law and her husband had died. \add At that moment,\add* she knelt down and gave birth \add because the birth pains suddenly started\add*.
\v 20 \add But she was dying\add*, and the women who stood over her said, “Don’t be afraid, because you’ve given birth to a son.” \add But\add* she didn’t answer \add or pay any attention\add*.
\v 21 She named the boy ‘Ikabod’ \add (which means ‘no glory’)\add*, saying, “The glory has departed from Yisrael,” about the \add sacred chest\add* being taken, and about \add the deaths of\add* her father-in-law and her husband.
\v 22 Then she said, “The glory has departed from Yisrael, because the \add sacred chest\add* has been taken.”
\c 5
\s1 The sacred chest gets carried to Ashdod
\p
\v 1 Now the Philistines had taken the \add sacred chest\add*, and they took it from Eben-Ezer to Ashdod
\v 2 \add where\add* they carried \add it\add* into the temple of \add their god\add* Dagon and placed it beside \add a statue of\add* Dagon.
\v 3 Early the next day \add when\add* the Ashdodites got up, \add to their horror\add* Dagon had fallen to the ground on its face \add in front of\add* Yahweh’s box. \add So\add* they \add stood it up\add* and returned it to its place.
\v 4 \add But\add* then the next morning, \add more shock\add*: Dagon had fallen to the ground on its face \add in front of\add* Yahweh’s box \add but now\add* \add its\add* hands and head were cut off, \add and were lying\add* on the threshhold. Only \add its body remained intact\add*.
\v 5 (\add Because of that\add*, until this day Dagon’s priests and everyone who enters Dagon’s temple in Ashdod won’t tread on the threshhold.)
\s1 God punishes the Philistine cities
\p
\v 6 Yahweh \add caused a lot of trouble\add* for the \add people of\add* Ashdod and he terrified them. He \add caused\add* them and \add the people in the region\add* to \add get lumpy growths on their skin\add*.
\v 7 \add When\add* the \add leaders\add* in Ashdod \add saw what was happening\add*, they said, “The God of Yisrael’s box mustn’t stay with us because \add he’s punishing\add* \add both\add* us and our god Dagon.”
\v 8 \add So\add* they sent for all the Philistine rulers, and \add when they’d assembled\add* they \add asked\add*, “What should we do with the God of Yisrael’s box?”
\p “Let the God of Yisrael’s box be taken around to Gat,” they \add decided\add*. \add So\add* they moved \add it\add* \add there\add*.
\v 9 After \add it arrived\add*, Yahweh \add started punishing Gat\add* and \add both\add* young and old men in the city started getting growths on their skin, and it caused a huge panic.
\v 10 \add So\add* they sent God’s box to Ekron, \add but\add* as soon as \add it\add* entered \add the city\add*, the Ekronites cried out, “\add Hey!\add* They’ve brought the God of Yisrael’s box here to \add kill us\add* and our people.”
\v 11 \add So\add* they sent for the Philistine rulers, and \add when they’d assembled\add* they said, “Send the God of Yisrael’s box away. \add Send it back\add* to its place \add so\add* it won’t \add cause us and our people to die\add*.” Because there was a \add deadly panic all over\add* the city \add as\add* \add God’s punishment there was severe\add*
\v 12 and the men who didn’t die suffered with the growths. \add So\add* the \add people’s\add* cry went up to the heavens.

\v 1 \add So it was that\add* Yahweh’s box was \add held\add* in Philistine territory for seven months,
\v 2 then the Philistines called \add their\add* priests and diviners and \add asked\add*, “What should we do with Yahweh’s box? \add Show us how we can get it back\add* away to its place.”
\p
\v 3 “If you’re going to send the God of Yisrael’s box back,” they \add responded\add*, “don’t send it \add back by itself\add*, but definitely return it to him with a guilt offering. Then you’ll all be healed, and you’ll all \add understand why you’ve been suffering\add*.”
\p
\v 4 “What guilt offering should we \add send with it\add*?” they \add asked\add*.
\p “Five gold \add replicas of the\add* tumours, and five gold mice,” they said. “That’s the number of \add our\add* rulers, because \add the same\add* plague \add affected both them and the people\add*.
\v 5 Make replicas of the tumours and replicas of the mice that have been destroying the land, and it will honour Yisrael’s God. Then perhaps he will \add less his punishment that’s been\add* on you and on your gods and on your land.
\v 6 Why \add have you all been so stubborn\add* just like the Egyptians when Pharaoh made \add them stubborn\add*? When \add Yisrael’s God\add* dealt severely with them, didn’t \add the Egyptians\add* send \add the Israelis\add* away and they went?
\v 7 \add So\add* now, \add get a brand\add* new cart with two nursing cows \add which have never had a yoke on their necks\add*. Hitch the cows to the cart \add but\add* take their calves \add back to their pen\add*.
\v 8 Then pick up Yahweh’s box and put it into the cart \add along with\add* the gold objects that you are \add sending with it\add* as a guilt offering \add put in another container beside the box\add*. \add Finally\add*, send \add the cart\add* away and \add off\add* it will go.
\v 9 Then watch \add it\add*. If it \add heads towards\add* Beyt-Shemesh \add in Israeli territory, then it’s their god that caused this terrible calamity\add*. \add But\add* if not, then we’ll know that \add it wasn’t the Israeli god, and that\add* it \add all\add* happened to us by chance.”
\p
\v 10 \add So they followed those instructions\add*: they took two cows \add that had been feeding calves\add* and hitched them to the \add new\add* cart, but they shut their calves away in the \add stall\add*.
\v 11 Then they put Yahweh’s box into the cart with the \add other\add* container with the gold mice and the replicas of their tumours.
\v 12 \add Amazingly,\add* the cows went straight down the road going to Beyt-Shemesh. They \add stayed on that\add* one highway, walking and mooing, and they \add never once deviated to the left or the right\add*, and the Philistine rulers followed them as far as the border of Beyt-Shemesh.
\p
\v 13 \add Meanwhile in\add* Beyt-Shemesh, \add the people\add* were harvesting wheat in the valley, and when they \add looked up\add* and saw the box, \add they were very happy\add*.
\v 14 The cart came into the field belonging to Yehoshua and \add then the cows just\add* stood there. There was a large stone there, and \add the people\add* split \add the sides of\add* the wooden cart \add into pieces to start a fire\add*, then offered the cows as a burnt sacrifice to Yahweh.
\v 15 Then the Levites lifted down Yahweh’s box and the \add other\add* container that was with it with the gold objects in it, and they placed them on the large stone. Then the men of Beyt-Shemesh offered up \add more\add* burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh on that day.
\v 16 The five Philistine rulers watched \add all this from a distance before\add* returning to Ekron that same day.
\s1 The gold replicas
\p
\v 17 The gold \add replicas\add* of tumours that the Philistines sent back as a guilt offering to Yahweh were for \add the five cities\add*: Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gat, and Ekron.
\v 18 And the gold mice were from the number of all the Philistine cities \add under\add* the five rulers, including fortified cities as \add well\add* as the villages in the open country, and as far as the large stone that they sat Yahweh’s box on. (It’s \add still\add* in Yehoshua’s field in Beyt-Shemesh until this day.)
\p
\v 19 \add But\add* some Beyt-Shemesh men looked into Yahweh’s box, and he killed seventy\f + \fr 6:19 \ft TC: The oldest Hebrew text has 50,070 men being killed here, making it hard to imagine how that many men kept clambering over dead bodies to look into the sacred chest. (But possibly we’re not understanding the situation correctly?) We have followed later manuscripts here.\f* of them. The people mourned because Yahweh had \add caused such devastation\add* among the people.
\s1 The sacred chest is taken to Kiryat-Yearim
\p
\v 20 The Beyt-Shemesh men said, “Who can stand in front of the face of Yahweh, this holy God? And \add where should we send the box to from here\add*?”
\v 21 \add So\add* they sent messengers to those living in Kiriat-Yearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned Yahweh’s box. Come \add over here and get it\add*.”
\c 7
\p
\v 1 \add So\add* the men from Kiriat-Yearim came and lifted up Yahweh’s box and brought it into Abinadab’s house on the hill. They consecrated his son Eleazar to \add take care of\add* \add it\add*.\x + \xo 7:1: \xt 2Sam 6:2-4; 1Ch 13:5-7.\x*
\s1 Shemuel guides Yisrael
\p
\v 2 The \add sacred chest ended up\add* staying in Kiriat-Yearim for twenty years \add but the Israelis longed sadly\add* for Yahweh.
\p
\v 3 Then Shemuel told all the \add Israelis\add*, “If you all \add really want\add* to return to Yahweh, remove the foreign gods and the Ashtorets from \add among you\add*. Then \add decide firmly to serve\add* Yahweh and \add no other\add*, then he’ll rescue you from the Philistines’ \add oppression\add*.”
\v 4 \add So the Israelis\add* removed the Baal and Ashtoret \add idols\add*, and \add began to\add* serve Yahweh only.
\p
\v 5 Then Shemuel \add called\add*, “Gather all Yisrael to Mitspah, and I’ll pray to Yahweh for you all.”
\v 6 \add So\add* they gathered at Mitspah, and drew water and poured it out \add in front\add* of Yahweh, and they fasted on that day and said there, “We have sinned against Yahweh.” And Shemuel \add guided\add* the \add Israelis\add* at Mitspah.
\p
\v 7 \add When\add* the Philistines heard that the \add Israelis\add* had gathered at Mitspah, the Philistine rulers \add decided to attack\add* Yisrael. \add When the Israelis\add* heard \add that\add*, they were afraid of the Philistines
\v 8 and \add begged\add* Shemuel, “Don’t \add stop\add* crying out to our God Yahweh, \add so that\add* he’ll rescue us from the Philistines.”
\v 9 \add So\add* Shemuel got a \add young\add* lamb and offered it up—a whole burnt up offering to Yahweh. And \add he\add* cried out to Yahweh for Yisrael, and Yahweh answered him.
\v 10 \add While\add* Shemuel was offering up that burnt offering, the Philistines approached to battle against Yisrael. \add But\add* that day Yahweh \add made an intense sound like thunder\add* that confused the Philistines and \add the Israelis were able to defeat them\add*.
\v 11 The Israeli men \add ran\add* out from Mitspah and chased the Philistines—killing them \add all the way to\add* Beyt-Kar.
\p
\v 12 Shemuel took a single rock and stood it between Mitspah and Shen. He \add named\add* it ‘Eben-Ezer’ \add (which means ‘stone of help’)\add*, saying, “Yahweh helped us \add all the way up to\add* here.”
\v 13 \add So\add* the Philistines \add ended up being\add* subdued and didn’t invade Yisrael’s border again, and Yahweh \add worked\add* against the Philistines \add as long as Shemuel lived\add*.
\v 14 The cities that the Philistines had taken from Ekron and as far as Gat were returned to Yisrael. And \add so\add* Yisrael rescued their territory from the Philistines, and there was peace between Yisrael and the Amorites.
\p
\v 15 \add So\add* Shemuel guided Yisrael \add while he lived\add*.
\v 16 \add Every year\add* he \add did the circuit\add* around Beyt-El, Gilgal, and Mitspah, and he \add helped settled disputes for the people in\add* all those places,
\v 17 \add but\add* he \add always\add* returned to Ramah because his home was there. He would \add judge disputes\add* there, and built an altar to Yahweh there.

\s1 The Israelis request a king
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 As Shemuel grew older, he appointed his \add two\add* sons as judges over Yisrael.
\v 2 The \add eldest\add* was Yoel and \add his brother\add* was Abiyah. They \add were based\add* in Beer-Sheva.
\v 3 \add However,\add* they \add didn’t take after time, but rather chased dishonest\add* gain—accepting bribes and perverting justice.
\p
\v 4 \add Eventually,\add* the Israeli elders met together with Shemuel at Ramah
\v 5 and \add requested\add*, “Listen, you’re old \add now\add*, and your sons don’t \add follow your example\add*. \add So\add* appoint a king for us now to \add lead\add* us like all the other nations.”\x + \xo 8:5: \xt Deu 17:14.\x*
\v 6 \add But\add* Shemuel \add thought that their request for a king was an evil request, so\add* \add he\add* prayed to Yahweh
\v 7 \add who replied\add*, “Listen to \add everything that the people are saying\add*, because they’re not rejecting \em you\em*, but they’re rejecting me from reigning over them.
\v 8 They’re doing to you just what they’ve done to me every since I \add rescued\add* them out of Egypt and right up until today: deserting me and serving other gods.
\v 9 \add So\add* listen to \add what they’re saying\add* now, but certainly warn them about \add what kings require of their subjects\add*.”
\s1 Advance warnings about having a king
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 10 Then Shemuel \add passed on everything that Yahweh had said\add* to the people who were requesting a king from him,
\v 11 telling them, “\add If you all have a king reigning over you, this is what he’ll demand\add*: he will \add conscript\add* your sons and appoint them \add as his cavalry or charioteers, or they’ll run as foot-soldiers in front\add*, of his chariot.
\v 12 \add Others he’ll appoint a commander of various units\add*. \add Some will end up ploughing his fields or harvesting his crops, or manufacturing his weapons and chariots\add*.
\v 13 He’ll take your daughters to \add manufacture perfumes\add*, or to be cooks and bakers.
\v 14 He’ll confiscate your \add best\add* fields and vineyards and olive orchards, and give to his servants \add to control\add*.
\v 15 Then he’ll demand a tenth of your seeds and \add grape harvests for\add* his officials and his servants.
\v 16 He’ll commandeer \add some of\add* your \add best\add* male and female servants and young men, and he’ll impound \add some of\add* your donkeys, then he’ll use \add them all\add* for his \add projects\add*.
\v 17 He’ll \add expect\add* a tenth of your \add sheep and goats\add*, and you yourselves \add will end up being\add* his slaves.
\v 18 \add When that all happens\add*, you’ll all cry out \add in front\add* of the king who you chose for yourselves, \add but\add* Yahweh won’t be answering you \add at that time\add*.”
\p
\v 19 \add However,\add* the people refused to \add consider Shemuel’s advice\add* and they \add argued\add*, “No, \add we want\add* a king over us
\v 20 \add so\add* we’ll be like all the other nations. Our king will judge us, and will \add lead out our warriors in battle\add*.”
\v 21 Shemuel listened to \add everything the people said, and passed it on to\add* Yahweh,
\v 22 and Yahweh told \add him\add*, “\add Do what they’re asking and get them\add* a king.” \add So\add* Shemuel \add told the people and then sent them all back to their homes\add*.

\s1 Sha’ul is chosen as king
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add Now\add* there was a Benyamite man named Kish (son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Bekorath, son of Afiah, the son of a Yaminite man) \add who was strong and wealthy\add*.
\v 2 \add Kish\add* had a son \add named\add* Sha’ul who was a handsome young man and good—\add in fact there wasn’t any Israeli man\add* better than him, \add and\add* he was \add head and shoulders taller than anyone else\add*.
\p
\v 3 \add One time,\add* the female donkeys of Sha’uls father Kish \add had gone missing\add*, and Kish \add told\add* his son, “Take one of the servants with you, and \add pack up\add* and go and find those donkeys.”
\v 4 \add So\add* \add they\add* passed through the Efraimite hill country, then through the Shalishah \add region\add*, but they didn’t find them. Then they went through the Shaalim \add region\add*, but there was nothing, \add so\add* \add they\add* \add continued on\add* through the land of the Benyamites, but they didn’t find them.
\v 5 \add Finally,\add* they entered the Tsuf \add area\add*, and \add eventually\add* Sha’ul said to his servant, “Come on. Let’s \add go back home in case\add* my father \add stops worrying\add* about the donkeys and \add starts\add* worrying about us.”
\p
\v 6 \add But\add* he \add replied\add*, “Listen, please. There’s an honoured man of God in this city. \add Everything he says comes true\add*. Let’s go there now. Perhaps he’ll tell us \add which way we should have gone\add*.”
\p
\v 7 “\add Okay, then.\add* We can go \add there\add*,” Sha’ul \add responded\add*, “but what \add can we give\add* the man? \add We don’t have any more food in our bags, and we never brought along a gift. What else do we have?\add*”
\p
\v 8 “Look,” answered the servant, “I’ve got a \add small silver coin\add*. We can give that to the man and he’ll tell us where to go.”
\v 9 (In Yisrael before then, \add when people wanted an answer from\add* God, they’d say, “Come and let us go to the ‘seer’,” because the prophet of today was called the ‘seer’ before.)
\p
\v 10 “\add Good idea\add*,” Sha’ul told his servant. “Let’s go then.” \add So\add* they went to the city there where the man of God was.
\v 11 They were \add climbing up the rise towards\add* the city \add when\add* they \add met some\add* young women going out to draw water, and they \add asked\add* them, “Is the seer in \add town\add*?”
\v 12 “\add Yes he is\add*,” they answered. “Hurry \add though\add*, because he’s come to the city today \add to offer\add* the sacrifice for the people at the high place.
\v 13 You’ll find him as soon as you enter the city, before he goes up to the high place to eat. The people won’t eat until he \add gets there\add*, because he himself will bless the sacrifice. Afterwards, \add those who’ve been invited\add* will eat \add together there\add*. So go up there now \add and you’ll soon find him\add*.”
\v 14 \add So\add* they went on up into the city, and as they were entering, wow, there was Shemuel \add coming out towards\add* them to go up to the high place.
\p
\v 15 \add On the previous day,\add* Yahweh \add had quietly told\add* Shemuel,
\v 16 “About this time tomorrow, I’ll send a Benyamite man to you, and you should anoint him to be ruler over my people Yisrael. He will \add rescue\add* my people from the Philistines, because I’ve \add noticed\add* my people because \add I heard their cries\add*.”
\p
\v 17 Then Shemuel saw Sha’ul, and Yahweh told him, “Look, \add that’s\add* the man that I you \add about\add*. \add He\add* will \add help control\add* my people.”
\v 18 \add As\add* Sha’ul approached Shemuel \add right there in the middle of the city gateway\add*, he \add asked\add*, “Please tell me, where’s the seer’s house?”
\p
\v 19 “I am the seer,” Shemuel answered, “\add Now,\add* Go up to the high place \add ahead of me\add*, and you’ll eat with me today. In the morning, I’ll tell you \add what you want to know\add*, then I’ll send you off.
\v 20 As for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, don’t \add worry anymore about them\add* because they’ve been found. Now, all of Yisrael is wanting your father’s \add household\add*, and \add wanting\add* you \add in particular\add*.”
\v 21 “\add But\add* I’m a Benyamite,” Sha’ul responded, “\add That’s\add* the smallest tribe in Yisrael, and my clan’s the lowliest of all the Benyamite clans. \add So\add* why \add did you talk to me like that\add*?”
\p
\v 22 Then Shemuel took Sha’ul and his servant to the room \add where the meal had been prepared\add*, and he gave them a place at the head of \add table—even above the invited guests\add*. (There were about thirty men.)
\v 23 And Shemuel told the cook, “Give the \add special\add* \add piece of meat\add* that I \add showed\add* you and said to keep aside.”
\v 24 \add So\add* the cook lifted the \add cooked leg\add* and \add placed it in front\add* of Sha’ul. Then \add Shemuel\add* told \add Sha’ul\add*, “Look, \add this has been reserved for you\add*. Eat \add it\add*, because it’s been kept \add until\add* the appointed time \add when I could call these people together\add*.”
\s1 Shemuel anoints Sha’ul with oil
\s4 Full kingdom
\p \add So\add* Sha’ul ate with Shemuel that day,
\v 25 and then they went \add back\add* from the high place down into the city, and \add Shemuel\add* spoke with Sha’ul on \add his house\add* roof.
\p
\v 26 They rose early \add the next day\add*. At dawn, Shemuel had called to Sha’ul on the roof, saying, “Get up and I will send you \add off\add*.” \add So\add* Sha’ul got up, and the two of them went outside.
\v 27 \add When\add* they \add reached\add* the edge of the city, Shemuel said to Sha’ul, “\add Tell your servant to go on ahead\add*,” and \add so\add* he went on ahead. “But you stand \add here\add*, and I’ll \add give you the message from\add* God.”
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Then Shemuel took a flask of oil, and poured it on \add Sha’ul’s\add* head and kissed him, and told him, “It’s Yahweh who has anointed you to be ruler over his \add chosen people\add*.
\v 2 \add After you leave me today\add* \add and get back to\add* Benyamite territory, then you’ll \add see\add* two men near Rachel’s tomb in Tseltsah, and they’ll say to you, ‘The donkeys that you went to look for have been found. \add But\add*, wow, your father has stopped worrying about the donkeys and \add now\add* he’s worried about \em you\em* \add and trying to figure out what he should do\add*.’
\v 3 Then further on from there, \add as you approach\add* the oak tree at Tabor, you’ll find three men going to Beyt-El to worship God. One will be taking three young goats, one will be carrying three rounds loaves of bread, and one will be carrying a wine in a container.
\v 4 They’ll ask about \add how you’re doing\add* and give you two loaves of bread which you should accept.
\v 5 After that, you’ll come to the hill of God (where there’s a camp of Philistine \add warriors\add*). \add When you enter\add* the town, you’ll meet a group of prophets descending from the \add altar area\add*,
\v 6 and Yahweh’s spirit will rush onto you. Then you’ll \add join\add* them in prophesying, and you’ll be transformed into a different person.
\v 7 \add When this all comes true\add*, do whatever you think is correct because God \add will be helping\add* you.
\v 8 Then go \add ahead of me\add* to Gilgal and wait \add there\add* for seven days, until I get there and tell you what to do. I’ll join you to offer burnt offerings \add and\add* to sacrifice peace offerings.
\p
\v 9 Then as Sha’ul \add started to leave\add* Shemuel, God \add changed his thinking\add*. Then all Shemuel’s predictions came true that day,
\v 10 \add so when\add* \add Sha’ul and his servant\add* came to the hill, a group of prophets met \add them\add* and God’s spirit rushed onto \add Sha’ul\add* and he \add joined them in\add* prophesying.
\v 11 Then everyone who had known \add Sha’ul\add* \add previously\add* heard him prophesying with the prophets, \add they asked each other\add*, “What’s happened to Kish’s son? Is Sha’ul really a prophet \add now\add*?”
\v 12 A man from there answered, “And who is \em their\em* father?” So after that it became a common saying, “Has Sha’ul also \add become a prophet\add*?”\x + \xo 10:12: \xt 1Sam 19:23-24.\x*
\v 13 When he had finished prophesying, he ascended to the \add altar area\add*.
\p
\v 14 \add Later,\add* Sha’ul’s uncle asked him and his servant, “Where did you \add two\add* \add take off to\add*?”
\p “To look for the donkeys,” Sha’ul replied. “\add But we couldn’t find them, so\add* we went to Shemuel.”
\p
\v 15 “\add And what did he tell you?\add*” \add the\add* uncle \add asked\add*.
\p
\v 16 “He \add assured\add* us that the donkeys had been found,” Sha’ul replied. \add But\add* he didn’t tell him anything that Shemuel had said \add about becoming king\add*.
\s1 Sha’ul is selected as king
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 17 Then Shemuel summoned the people \add to come before\add* Yahweh at Mitspah,
\v 18 and he told \add them\add*, “Yahweh, the God of Yisrael, says, ‘I myself brought Yisrael out of Egypt. I rescued you from \add Egyptian control\add*, and from all the kingdoms that oppressed you.’
\v 19 \add But since then\add*, you all have rejected your God—the one who saves you from all your calamities and distresses. And you’ve all said to him, ‘\add We’d rather have\add* a king over us.’ \add So\add* station yourselves now \add in front\add* of Yahweh by your tribes and \add clans\add*.”
\p
\v 20 Then Shemuel had all the Israeli tribes approach, and the tribe of Benyamin was selected.
\v 21 Then he had all the Benyamite clans approach, and the Matri clan was selected. Then Kish’s son, Sha’ul was selected and they tried to find him, but \add they couldn’t find him anywhere\add*
\v 22 \add so\add* they asked Yahweh again, “\add Is that man around here anywhere\add*?”
\p “Look, he’s hiding among the supplies,” Yahweh \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 23 \add So\add* they ran and got him from there, and \add when\add* he took his place among the people, he was head and shoulders taller than anyone else.
\v 24 Then Shemuel \add announced to everyone\add*, “Can you see the one that Yahweh has chosen? Certainly there’s no one else like him among all the people.”
\p All the people saw \add that\add* and \add responded\add*, “\add Long\add* live the king.”
\p
\v 25 Then Shemuel \add explained\add* how the kingship would work, and wrote it in a book and placed it \add in front\add* of Yahweh. Then \add he\add* sent \add everyone home\add*.
\v 26 Shemuel also went \add home\add* to Gibeah, \add accompanied by some of\add* the powerful \add warriors\add* whose hearts God had touched.
\v 27 \add But some worthless men asked\add*, “How can that one save us?” and they despised \add Sha’ul\add* and didn’t bring him any gifts, but he \add made no comment\add*.
\c 11
\s1 Sha’ul rescues Yabesh from the Ammonites
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add About a month later,\add*\f + \fr 11:1 \ft This appears only in a few ancient documents.\f* Nahash the Ammonite \add took his men\add* and camped \add around\add* Yabesh-Gilead, and the \add leaders\add* of Yabesh told \add him\add*, “\add Make a treaty with\add* us, and we’ll serve you.”
\p
\v 2 “\add Yes,\add* I’ll \add make an treaty with\add* you,” Nahash \add replied\add*, “by gouging out \add all of your\add* right \add eyes\add* \add in order to shame\add* all Yisrael.”
\p
\v 3 “\add Oh! Then\add* leave us alone for seven days,” the Yabesh elders \add responded\add*, “so that we can send messengers through all the territory of Yisrael. If no one \add will come to rescue\add* us, then we’ll \add surrender\add* to you.”
\p
\v 4 \add When\add* the messengers arrived \add where Sha’ul lived\add* at Gibeah and \add passed the news onto the people\add*, \add everyone started wailing loudly\add*.
\v 5 \add At that time\add*, Sha’ul was walking home behind the cattle and \add he\add* asked, “What’s with \add all\add* the people wailing?” Then they \add told\add* him \add what the messengers from Yabesh had said\add*.
\v 6 God’s spirit rushed on Sha’ul as he heard the message, and \add he became very angry\add*.
\v 7 Then he took a pair of cattle and \add chopped\add* them into pieces, and sent messengers to take them \add throughout\add* Yisrael and \add announce\add*, “This is what will be done to the cattle of \add anyone who doesn’t join\add* Sha’ul and Shemuel \add in battle\add*.”
\p Then Yahweh \add caused the people to be afraid of him\add*, and they united together.
\v 8 \add When\add* \add Sha’ul\add* assembled them at Bezek, there were three hundred thousand \add warriors\add* from Yisrael and thirty thousand from Yehudah,
\v 9 and they told the \add original\add* messengers, “\add Go and\add* \add tell the leaders\add* of Yabesh-Gilead, ‘Tomorrow \add you’ll all be rescued \add by the time that\add* the sun’s at its hottest\add*.’ ”
\v 10 \add So\add* the Yabesh \add leaders told\add* \add Nahash\add*, “\add We’ll surrender\add* to you all tomorrow, then you can do to us \add whatever seems good to you all\add*.”
\p
\v 11 The next day, Sha’ul divided \add his\add* warriors into three divisions, and they \add attacked the Ammonite camp before the sun rose\add*. Then they \add slaughtered the Ammonites\add* until the hottest part of the day. \add Their\add* remaining warriors were scattered \add so completely that no two of them were able to stay\add* together.
\s1 Sha’ul reaffirmed as king
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 12 Then the people \add asked\add* Shemuel, “Who \add were the ones saying that Sha’ul wasn’t fit to\add* reign over us? \add Bring them here\add* and we’ll \add execute\add* them.”
\p
\v 13 “\add No one’s going to be executed\add* today,” Sha’ul said, “because today Yahweh has \add rescued\add* Yisrael.”

\v 14 “Come \add on then\add*,” said Shemuel. “Let’s go to Gilgal and renew the kingship there.”
\v 15 \add So\add* all the people when to Gilgal and \add in front\add* of Yahweh they \add reaffirmed Sha’ul as king\add*. Then they offered sacrifices \add as\add* peace offerings \add to\add* Yahweh, then Sha’ul and the people \add celebrated together\add*.

\s1 Shemuel’s farewell speech
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 Then Shemuel said to all Yisrael, “\add Listen to me now.\add* I’ve listened to your voices \add and taken notice of everything\add* that you all said to me. And I’ve \add appointed\add* a king to reign over you all.
\v 2 \add So look now and you can see your king walking here in front of you all\add*. \add But as for me,\add* I’m old and gray, and my sons are among you all. I’ve \add served you all openly\add* from my youth right up to the present time,
\v 3 \add and\add* here I am now. \add Now with Yahweh listening, answer this truthfully\add*: Have I \add ever\add* taken anyone’s ox or donkey? Did I cheat anyone? Have I oppressed anyone or taken a bribe \add to not see something\add*? I’ll pay back anything I owe \add anyone\add*.”
\p
\v 4 “\add No,\add* you haven’t cheated us,” they \add answered\add*. “And you haven’t oppressed us or taken \add any payments\add*.”
\p
\v 5 “Yahweh is a \add your\add* witness,” he said. “And his anointed \add king\add* is a witness today, that you have \add never found me taking anything that wasn’t mine\add*.”
\p “\add We witness that\add*,” \add they\add* \add agreed\add*.
\p
\v 6 “It was Yahweh who appointed Mosheh and Aharon,” Shemuel continued, “and who brought your ancestors out of Egypt.\x + \xo 12:6: \xt Exo 6:26.\x*
\v 7 Now present yourselves to Yahweh as I confront you all in \add front\add* of \add him\add* \add by telling you about\add* \add his\add* righteousness that he \add displayed to\add* you all \add as well as\add* to your ancestors \add before you\add*:
\v 8 After Yacob went to Egypt and your ancestors cried out to Yahweh, then Yahweh sent Mosheh and Aharon, and they brought your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them into this place.\x + \xo 12:8: \xt Exo 2:23.\x*
\v 9 Then they forgot their God Yahweh, and he \add allowed them to be oppressed by\add* Sisera (the commander of the army from Hazor), and the Philistines, and the king of Moab. Then they fought against them\x + \xo 12:9: a \xt Jdg 4:2; \xo b \xt Jdg 13:1; \xo c \xt Jdg 3:12.\x*
\v 10 and cried out to Yahweh, ‘We have sinned, because we’ve abandoned Yahweh and have served the Baals and the Ashtorets. \add But if\add* you rescue us now from our enemies, we will serve you.’\x + \xo 12:10: \xt Jdg 10:10-15.\x*
\v 11 Then Yahweh sent \add Gideon\add*, Bedan, Yeftah, and Shimshon\f + \fr 12:11 \ft TC: This list of four names varies between different ancient manuscripts so you might find variation in other translations.\f* \add to\add* rescue you all from your enemies all around you, and \add so\add* you all \add have had times of\add* living securely.\x + \xo 12:11: a \xt Jdg 7:1; \xo b \xt Jdg 4:6; \xo c \xt Jdg 11:29; \xo d \xt 1Sam 3:20.\x*
\v 12 \add But then\add* you all saw \add Ammonite\add* King Nahash coming against you, and you \add demanded that you all wanted a king to reign over you rather than having\add* your God Yahweh as your king.\x + \xo 12:12: \xt 1Sam 8:19.\x*
\p
\v 13 \add So\add* now, look, \add here’s\add* the king that you all \add chose to have\add*. \add Yes,\add*, Yahweh has given you all a king.
\v 14 If you all \add honour\add* Yahweh and listen to his \add instructions\add* and don’t rebel against \add his commands\add*, then \add both\add* you and your king will \add indeed\add* be \add following\add* your God Yahweh.
\v 15 \add But\add* if you all don’t listen to Yahweh, and you rebel against \add his commands\add*, then \add he\add* will \add work\add* against you all \add just like he worked against\add* your ancestors.\f + \fr 12:15 \ft TC: or (in the ancient Septuagint translation), …against you all \bd and your king\bd*.\f*
\v 16 So now \add stay there\add* and you’ll all see the incredible sign that Yahweh is about to do \add in front of you\add*.
\v 17 \add Now,\add* isn’t it \add the time of\add* the wheat harvest \add right now\add*? I’ll call to Yahweh, and he’ll \add send\add* \add unseasonal\add* thunder and rain, and then you’ll all see and realise that \add in Yahweh’s view, asking for a king was very evil\add*.”
\p
\v 18 \add So\add* Shemuel called to Yahweh and \add he\add* sent thunder and rain that day, and all the people \add became very afraid of\add* Yahweh and Shemuel
\v 19 and \add begged\add* Shemuel, “Pray to your God Yahweh for your servants, so that we won’t die, because we’ve added \add more\add* evil onto all our \add previous\add* sins by requesting a king for ourselves.”
\p
\v 20 “Don’t be afraid,” Shemuel \add responded\add*. “You yourselves have \add indeed\add* done all this evil. However, don’t \add make it worse by\add* turning away from Yahweh, but rather, serve \add him\add* with all your \add being\add*.
\v 21 And don’t turn away from Yahweh \add and worship\add* \add useless\add* \add idols\add* because they can’t benefit you or rescue you, because they’re empty \add of life\add*.
\v 22 Yahweh won’t abandon his people because \add he has an excellent reputation\add* \add to uphold\add*, \add especially since he’s declared\add* you all to be his people.
\v 23 Also, far be it from me to sin against Yahweh by not praying for you all, as well as instructing you all in the good and \add proper\add* way.
\v 24 Just \add honour\add* Yahweh and serve him faithfully and \add sincerely\add*—\add always\add* \add remembering\add* the incredible things he’s done for you all.
\v 25 \add But\add* if you all continue to do evil, both you and your king will get swept away.”

\s1 Shemuel scolds Sha’ul
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 Sha’ul was thirty\f + \fr 13:1 \ft TC: There’s some confusion around the numbers in this verse in the original manuscripts, so other translations might differ.\f* years old when he \add began to\add* reign over Yisrael, and \add when\add* he’d reigned for two years,
\v 2 he chose three thousand \add Israeli\add* \add warriors\add* for himself: two thousand were \add stationed\add* with \add him\add* in Mikmas, and one thousand were with \add his son\add* Yonatan in Benyamite Gibeah. \add All the others\add*, he sent \add back to their homes\add*.
\p
\v 3 Then Yonatan \add attacked and defeated\add* the Philistine unit that was at Geba, and the Philistines heard \add about it\add*. \add So\add* Sha’ul \add had\add* a trumpet blown \add throughout\add* the \add country, with the message\add*, “\add Listen all you\add* Hebrews.”
\v 4 All of Yisrael heard \add the news that\add* Sha’ul had \add wiped out\add* a Philistine outpost, and \add realised that\add* Yisrael had become \add repulsive to\add* the Philistines. \add So\add* the people were \add summoned to join\add* Sha’ul at Gilgal.
\p
\v 5 The Philistines \add assembled themselves\add* to fight Yisrael \add with\add* thirty thousand chariots, six thousand mounted cavalry, and warriors \add as numerous\add* as the sand on the \add beach\add*. They went to Mikmas and camped \add there\add*, east of Beyt-Aven.
\v 6 \add But\add* the \add Israeli warriors\add* were \add very anxious\add* because their troops were \add so outnumbered\add*, \add so\add* they hid in caves and thickets, among rocks, and in tombs and wells.
\v 7 \add Some of them\add* crossed the Yordan \add River\add* to the Gad and Gilead regions.
\p Sha’ul stayed at Gilgal, but the people with him were trembling.
\v 8 He waited seven days until the time \add when Shemuel had said that he’d get there, but he didn’t appear so Sha’ul’s men began to desert him\add*.\x + \xo 13:8: \xt 1Sam 10:8.\x*
\v 9 “Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings,” Sha’ul \add commanded\add*, then he offered up the burnt offering.
\v 10 Just as he’d finished, wow, Shemuel arrived \add at last\add*, and Sha’ul went over to greet him.
\v 11 “What have you done?” Shemuel \add asked\add*.
\p “When I saw the people \add leaving\add* me,” Sha’ul \add replied\add* “and you, you didn’t \add get here when you said you would\add*, and the Philistines were gathering at Mikmas,
\v 12 then I \add thought\add*, ‘The Philistines \add are about to attack us at\add* Gilgal, and I haven’t \add offered any gift to\add* Yahweh.’ So I forced myself, and offered up the burnt up offering.”
\p
\v 13 “\add That was stupid of you\add*,” Shemuel \add responded\add*. “You haven’t \add obeyed what your God Yahweh instructed\add*, because \add if you had,\add* then Yahweh would have established your reign over Yisrael \add forever\add*.
\v 14 \add But\add* now your kingdom won’t \add survive\add*. Yahweh has found a man who’s \add loyal to him\add* and \add he’s\add* commanded \add that man\add* to lead his people, because you haven’t \add obeyed\add* him.\x + \xo 13:14: \xt Acts 13:22.\x*
\p
\v 15 Then Shemuel \add left\add* Gilgal and went to Gibeah in Benyamite \add territory\add*. \add Meanwhile,\add* Sha’ul counted up the \add warriors\add* with him—around six hundred \add of them\add*.
\v 16 Sha’ul and his son Yonatan and the people with them, were staying in Geba, \add whereas\add* the Philistines were camped at Mikmas,
\v 17 and they sent out three \add raiding parties\add*—one went \add north\add* to Ofrah in the Shu’al region,
\v 18 one went \add west\add* to Beyt-Horon, and one went towards the wilderness where the border overlooks the Zeboim valley.
\p
\v 19 \add At that time,\add* \add there were no blacksmiths in\add* Yisrael because the Philistines \add didn’t want the Israelis to be able to make swords or spears\add*,
\v 20 \add so\add* all \add the Israelis\add* had to go to the Philistines to get their axes and \add plough blades\add*, \add etc.\add*, sharpened.
\v 21 (\add They were charged\add* two-thirds of a shekel for \add larger things like plough blades\add*, and one-third for picks and axes, and for straightening \add ox\add* goads.)
\v 22 \add So\add* on the day of battle, Sha’ul and his son Yonatan \add had a sword and spear each, but none of the warriors with them had any\add*.
\p
\v 23 \add Now\add* one Philistine unit \add had been sent out to guard\add* the pass at Mikmas.
\c 14
\s1 Yonatan’s bravery
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 Then \add one\add* day, Sha’uls son Yonatan said to the young man who carried his equipment, “Come, and let’s cross over to the Philistine unit that’s \add over on the opposite side\add*.” \add But\add* he didn’t tell his father.
\v 2 \add Meanwhile,\add* Sha’ul \add was still waiting\add* under the pomegranate tree in Migron on the outskirts of Geba with around six-hundred \add warriors\add*.
\v 3 Ahiyah \add the priest\add* was also there \add wearing\add* a sacred apron. (He was son of Ahitub the brother of Ikabod, son of Finehas, son of Eli, Yahweh’s priest at Shiloh.) \add But\add* the people didn’t know that Yonatan had gone.
\p
\v 4 \add Meanwhile, for Yonatan to get to the Philistine garrison, they had to go through a narrow pass between two cliffs\add*. (The cliff on one side was named Botsets, and the other was named Senneh.
\v 5 \add One cliff faced north toward Mikmas, and the other side faced south toward Geba\add*.)
\p
\v 6 Yonatan said to his servant carrying his equipment, “Come on. Let’s pass over to that group of these uncircumcised ones. Perhaps Yahweh will \add help\add* us, because \add it doesn’t matter to him whether he saves\add* using many \add people\add* or \add just\add* a few.”
\p
\v 7 “Do \add everything that you feel is right\add*,” \add he\add* \add responded\add*. “\add Go on ahead and be confident that I’ll be there supporting you\add*.”
\p
\v 8 “\add Listen then\add*,” Yonatan said. “We’ll cross over and then reveal ourselves to them.
\v 9 Then if they tell us, ‘\add Stay there until we get down to\add* you,’ then we’ll stay where we are and not go up to them.
\v 10 \add But\add* if they say, ‘Come on up to us,’ then we’ll go up, because that’ll be the sign to us that Yahweh \add will help us overpower them\add*.”
\p
\v 11 \add So\add* the two of them revealed themselves to the Philistine unit, and the \add soldiers\add* said, “\add Hey, look\add*. The Hebrews are coming out from the holes there where they’ve hidden themselves.”
\v 12 Then \add some\add* of the men \add called\add* to Yonatan and his \add servant\add*, “Come on up \add here to us and we’ll teach you a thing or two\add*.”
\p “Come on up behind me,” Yonatan told his servant, “because Yahweh \add has already declared Yisrael to be the victor\add*.”
\v 13 \add So\add* Yonatan climbed up on his hands and feet, \add with his servant following\add* behind him. Then \add at the top\add*, Yonatan struck them down \add with his sword\add* while his servant \add followed behind and\add* killed them.
\v 14 In that first offensive, Yonatan and his servant \add killed\add* about twenty men in an area of around 30m square.
\v 15 \add At that time\add*, \add Philistines\add* in the camp \add started getting the jitters\add*, then all the people and \add even\add* raiding parties. Then the ground shook, and it \add turned into a God-given panic\add*.
\s1 Yisrael defeats the Philistines
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 16 Sha’uls lookouts in Gibeah (in Benyamite territory) saw to their surprise that \add their opponents were starting to scatter in every direction\add*.
\v 17 “\add Count our people and see who’s missing\add*,” Sha’ul commanded, so they \add called the roll\add* and wow, it was Yonatan and his servant who weren’t accounted for.
\v 18 “Bring the sacred chest here,” Sha’ul told Ahiyah \add the priest\add*, because the \add Israelis had control of it again at that time\add*.
\v 19 \add But even as\add* Sha’ul was speaking to \add him\add*, the confusion in the Philistine camp was continually increasing, and Sha’ul told him, “\add Oh,\add* \add don’t worry about it\add*.”
\v 20 Then \add he\add* called his warriors together and they went \add forward\add* to battle. \add To their surprise\add*, the \add Philistines were fighting each other in total\add* confusion.
\v 21 \add Now before that time,\add* some Hebrews \add had joined the Philistine camp, but now they switched alliance back to\add* Yisrael with Sha’ul and Yonatan.
\v 22 \add Also,\add* there had been \add some Israeli deserters\add* who’d hidden in the Efraimite hill country heard that the Philistines were fleeing, and \add so\add* they too also \add chased and attacked\add* them.
\v 23 \add So\add* Yahweh saved Yisrael that day, and the fighting went as far as Beyt-Aven.
\s1 Yonatan eats honey
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 24 \add Now\add* the \add Israeli warriors\add* were \add getting exhausted\add* that day, \add but\add* Sha’ul had made the \add them\add* promise, “\add We need to avenge our\add* enemies. Anyone who eats food before the evening is cursed.”
\v 25 \add But when they reached\add* the forest, there was honeycomb on the ground.
\v 26 \add Although the warriors\add* entered the forest and saw the honey, none of them \add tasted any\add* because they were afraid of the curse.
\v 27 \add But\add* Yonatan hadn’t heard his father’s oath, so he dipped his staff into the honeycomb and \add ate some honey and felt rejuvenated\add*.
\v 28 \add However, someone noticed it and mentioned\add*, “Your father made the people promise, ‘Anyone who eats food today will be cursed.’ So the people are faint.”
\p
\v 29 “My father’s \add caused trouble for us\add*,” Yonatan \add responded\add*. “See \add how much better I feel now\add* because I tasted a little \add bit\add* of this honey.
\v 30 Actually, if the troops had eaten what they’d found from the plunder of their enemies today, how much better it would have been because \add we might have had an even more decisive victory over the\add* Philistines.”
\p
\v 31 That day they killed Philistines from Mikmas to Ayyalon, \add but\add* the fighters were \add totally exhausted\add*.
\v 32 \add They\add* rushed greedily at the plunder, grabbing sheep, cattle, and calves which they slaughtered \add right there\add* and ate with the blood \add still in them\add*.
\v 33 Then King Sha’ul was told, “Look, the people are sinning against Yahweh by eating \add meat\add* with the blood \add still in it\add*.”
\p “You’ve all acted treacherously,” he \add responded\add*, “\add Now,\add* roll a big stone \add over\add* to me.”\x + \xo 14:33: \xt Gen 9:4; Lev 7:26-27; 17:10-14; 19:26; Deu 12:16,23; 15:23.\x*
\v 34 Then \add he\add* said, “Go out among the \add warriors\add* and tell them to bring their \add animals over here\add* to slaughter and to eat, so \add they\add* don’t sin against Yahweh by eating \add meat with\add* the blood \add still in it\add*.” So the people brought their \add animals over\add* and slaughtered them there.
\v 35 Then Sha’ul built an altar to Yahweh—\add it was the first one he built\add*.
\p
\v 36 Then Sha’ul said, “Let’s go after the Philistines tonight and plunder them until the light of morning. Let’s not leave \add any of them alive\add*.”
\p “Do \add what you feel is right\add*,” they \add responded\add*.
\p \add But\add* the priest said, “Let’s \add ask God here first\add*.”
\p
\v 37 \add So\add* Sha’ul asked God, “Should \add we\add* go after the Philistines? Will you give Yisrael \add victory over them\add*?” \add But\add* \add Yahweh\add* didn’t answer him that day.
\v 38 Then Sha’ul \add commanded\add*, “All \add you leaders of the warriors. Gather\add* here \add so we can find out\add* what sin \add was committed\add* today.
\v 39 As Yahweh who saves Yisrael lives, even if it’s my \add own\add* son Yonatan, \add whoever sinned today\add* will certainly die.” \add But the people didn’t volunteer\add* \add any information\add*.
\v 40 “You all can be on one side, and my son Jonathan and I will be on \add the other\add* side,” Sha’ul said.
\p “Do \add whatever feels right to you\add*,” the people \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 41 Then Sha’ul \add asked\add* Yisrael’s God Yahweh, “\add Show us the truth\add*.” And Sha’ul and Yonatan were selected—not the people.\x + \xo 14:41: \xt Num 27:21; 1Sam 28:6.\x*
\v 42 Then Sha’ul \add asked\add* \add again\add*, “\add Choose\add* between me and my son Yonatan.” And Yonatan was selected.
\v 43 Sha’ul \add demanded from\add* Yonatan, “Tell me what you’ve done.”
\p “Actually,” Yonatan \add answered\add*, “I did taste some honey from the end of my staff, so take me—I’m \add ready\add* to die.”
\p
\v 44 “May God do \add to me whatever he wants\add*,” Sha’ul said. “because you will certainly die, Yonatan.”
\p
\v 45 \add But\add* the people \add stood up to\add* Sha’ul, “Should Yonatan die? \add Wasn’t it him who saved\add* Yisrael \add today\add*? \add We won’t stand for it\add*. As Yahweh lives, \add not even a hair on his head will be touched\add* because he worked with God today.” And \add so\add* the people rescued Yonatan and he \add wasn’t executed\add*.
\p
\v 46 Then Sha’ul \add stopped chasing\add* the Philistines \add and went home\add*, and the Philistines \add also\add* returned to their place.
\s1 Sha’ul’s kingdom, and his family details

\p
\v 47 \add After\add* Sha’ul had taken on the kingship of Yisrael, he fought against their enemies from all around: against the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Edomites, the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he punished \add his enemies\add*.
\v 48 He acted bravely and \add defeated\add* \add even\add* the Amalekites, \add always\add* rescuing Yisrael from those who \add came in to\add* plunder it.
\p
\v 49 Sha’ul’s sons were Yonatan, Ishvi, and Malki-Shua. His oldest daughter was Merab, and the younger one was Mikal.
\v 50 His wife’s name was Ahinoam (daughter of Ahima’ats). His army commander was Abner (son of Sha’ul’s uncle Ner—
\v 51 Kish was Sha’uls father, and Abner’s father Ner was Abiel’s son).
\p
\v 52 The conflict with the Philistines was intensive for all of Sha’uls life, \add so\add* whenever he saw a \add good warrior\add* or any strong, young man, then he would \add conscript\add* \add them\add*.
\c 15
\s1 Sha’ul destroys the Amalekites
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add One day\add* Shemuel said to Sha’ul, “It was Yahweh who sent me to anoint you as king over his people Yisrael \add back then\add*, \add so\add* now, listen to \add what he has to say\add*.\x + \xo 15:1: \xt 1Sam 10:1.\x*
\v 2 Commander Yahweh says, ‘I’ve noticed what \add the Amalekites\add* did to Yisrael when they came out of Egypt—\add they attacked them\add* \add as they passed by\add*.\x + \xo 15:2: \xt Exo 17:8-14; Deu 25:17-19.\x*
\v 3 \add So\add* go now and attack Amalek and destroy \add them\add* completely without compassion, putting men and women, children and infants to death, along with \add their\add* cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.’ ”
\p
\v 4 \add So\add* Sha’ul summoned the people to Telaim and counted them: two hundred thousand foot soldiers as well as ten thousand \add warriors\add* from Yehudah.
\v 5 Then Sha’ul \add took them\add* to Amalek city, and \add they\add* lay in wait in the valley.
\v 6 Then \add he\add* \add warned\add* the Kenites, “\add You all need to move out from among\add* the Amalekites, \add so that you all won’t be attacked along with them\add*. \add That’s because you all were kind to our ancestors\add* when they came out of Egypt.” \add So\add* the Kenites \add moved out from among the Amalekites\add*.
\p
\v 7 Then Sha’ul \add slaughtered the Amalekites\add* from Havilah to Shur (near Egypt),
\v 8 and \add they\add* captured King Agag alive \add but\add* killed everyone else with swords.
\v 9 \add However, as well as sparing\add* Agag, they \add took\add* the best sheep and cattle
\s1 God rejects Sha’ul
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 10 \add Then\add* Yahweh \add told\add* Shemuel,
\v 11 “I regret that I’ve \add appointed\add* Sha’ul as king because he’s turned \add away from following\add* me and hasn’t \add obeyed my instructions\add*.” \add That really upset\add* Shemuel and he cried out to Yahweh all night.
\v 12 Early the next morning, Shemuel \add got up\add* to meet Sha’ul, \add but someone\add* told \add him\add*, “Sha’ul went to Karmel, and wow, he set up a monument to himself. Then he turned around and went to Gilgal.”
\v 13 \add When\add* Shemuel \add caught up with\add* Sha’ul, Sha’ul told him, “May Yahweh bless you. I’ve \add followed Yahweh’s instructions\add*.”
\p
\v 14 “Then what’s \add that bleating of sheep that I can hear\add*?” \add asked\add* Shemuel. “And \add I’m sure I can hear cattle sounds too\add*?”
\p
\v 15 “\add Ah,\add* \add the warriors took\add* them from the Amalekites,” Sha’ul \add answered\add*. “They \add wanted to save\add* the best of the sheep and the cattle in order to sacrifice to your God Yahweh. \add But\add* we completely destroyed the rest.”
\p
\v 16 “Stop,” said Shemuel, “and let me tell you what Yahweh \add told me last\add* night.”
\p “\add Go ahead\add*,” \add Sha’ul\add* \add responded\add*.
\p
\v 17 \add So\add* Shemuel told \add him\add*, “Although you \add consider yourself insignificant\add*, aren’t you the head of the tribes of Yisrael? Yahweh anointed you as king over Yisrael,
\v 18 then sent you \add off with the task of completely destroying the sinful Amalekites—fighting until they were all destroyed\add*.
\v 19 \add So\add* why didn’t you \add obey Yahweh’s command\add*? \add Instead,\add* you \add headed straight for the plunder and disobeyed Yahweh\add*.”
\p
\v 20 “I \add did listen to Yahweh’s instructions\add*,” Sha’ul \add insisted\add*. “and \add I did what he asked\add*. \add So now\add* I’ve brought Amalekite King Agag \add here\add* and I’ve completely destroyed the Amalekites.
\v 21 \add Yes,\add* the people \add kept some of the best\add* sheep and cattle to sacrifice to your God Yahweh here at Gilgal.”
\p
\v 22 \add But\add* Shemuel \add asked\add*,
\q1 “Is Yahweh \add happier\add* with burnt offerings and sacrifices
\q1 than \add with those who follow his instructions\add*?
\q1 Listen, \add obedience\add* is better than sacrifice—
\q1 paying attention is \add worth\add* more than the fat of rams.
\q1
\v 23 Rebellion is as sinful as doing sorcery,
\q1 and being stubborn is as sinful as worshipping idols.
\q1 Because you have rejected Yahweh’s \add instructions\add*,
\q1 he has rejected you as king.”
\p
\v 24 “\add Yes,\add* I’ve sinned,” Sha’ul \add responded\add*. “\add I can see that\add* I’ve \add disobeyed Yahweh’s instruction, and yours too\add*, because I feared the people and \add did what they were requesting\add*.
\v 25 \add But\add* now, please forgive my sin and come back with me so I can worship Yahweh.”
\p
\v 26 “\add No,\add* I won’t return with you.” Shemuel \add replied\add*. “You’ve rejected Yahweh’s \add instructions\add*, and Yahweh has \add already\add* rejected you as Yisrael’s king.”
\p
\v 27 \add As\add* Shemuel turned around to go, \add Sha’ul\add* grabbed the edge of his robe and it tore.\x + \xo 15:27-28: \xt 1Sam 28:17; 1Ki 11:30-31.\x*
\v 28 “Today, Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Yisrael away from you,” Shemuel told him. “And he’s given it to \add another man who’s\add* better than you.
\v 29 And \add by the way\add*, Yisrael’s powerful \add God\add* doesn’t \add go back on his word\add*, and doesn’t change his mind \add like people tend to do\add*.
\p
\v 30 “\add It’s true that\add* I’ve sinned,” Sha’ul said, “\add but\add* please honour me now in front of the Israeli people and their elders. And then return with me, so I can worship your God Yahweh.”
\v 31 \add So\add* Shemuel followed Sha’ul back, and Sha’ul worshipped Yahweh.
\p
\v 32 Then Shemuel \add commanded\add*, “Bring the Amalekite King Agag over here to me.”
\p \add So\add* they \add brought\add* him over, and trembling,\f + \fr 15:32 \ft The meaning of the original word here is unclear and so there’ll be different interpretations.\f* he said, “\add I’ve faced up to death now\add*.”\f + \fr 15:32 \ft Some translations interpret the original words as Agag thinking (or saying to himself) that he was going to be spared, but he surely knew Shemuel.\f*
\p
\v 33 Then Shemuel told \add him\add*,
\q1 “Just as your sword has made women childless,
\q1 so \add too\add* will your mother be made childless among women.”
\m And Samuel hacked Agag to pieces \add in front\add* of Yahweh \add there\add* at Gilgal.
\p
\v 34 Then Shemuel went \add home\add* to Ramah, and Sha’ul returned to his house in Gibeah.
\v 35 \add After that,\add* Shemuel never saw Sha’ul again, but he mourned for him, and Yahweh regretted that he’d made Sha’ul king over Yisrael.
\c 16
\s1 Shemuel anoints David as King
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh spoke to Shemuel, “\add How long are you going to keep mourning for Sha’ul for\add*, when I myself have rejected him as king over Yisrael? Fill your horn with oil and go. I’ll send you to Yishay (Jesse) from Bethlehem, because I’ve seen \add one of his sons who’d make a\add* \add good\add* king for me.”
\p
\v 2 “How can I \add do that\add*?” \add asked\add* Shemuel. “Sha’ul would kill me if he heard about it.”
\p “Take a heifer \add with you\add*,” Yahweh said, “and say, ‘I’ve come to sacrifice to Yahweh.’
\v 3 \add Invite\add* Yishay to the sacrifice, and I’ll show you what do to \add from there\add*, and you should anoint the one I tell you to.”
\p
\v 4 \add So\add* Shemuel did what Yahweh had told him, and went to Bethlehem. The town elders trembled when they met him, and \add asked\add*, “Do you come in peace?”
\p
\v 5 “\add Yes,\add* in peace,” he \add answered\add* “I’ve come to sacrifice to Yahweh. Purify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” Then he purified Yishay and his sons and called them to the sacrifice.
\p
\v 6 \add When they arrived\add*, \add Shemuel\add* saw Eliab and \add thought\add*, “Surely \add this man’s the one that Yahweh wants to anoint\add*.”
\v 7 \add But\add* Yahweh told \add him\add*, “Don’t look at his height or outward appearance, because I’ve rejected him. Because it isn’t what a person sees with their eyes, but Yahweh sees \add their motives and values\add*.”
\p
\v 8 Then Yishay called for Abinadab to \add walk across in front\add* of Shemuel, \add but\add* he said again, “Yahweh hasn’t chosen that one.”
\v 9 Then Yishay made Shammah \add walk across in front\add*, \add but\add* again he said, “Yahweh hasn’t chosen that one.”
\v 10 \add So\add* \add all up,\add* Yishay made seven of his sons \add walk across in front\add* of Shemuel, \add but\add* Shemuel told \add him\add*, “Yahweh hasn’t chosen any of them.”
\v 11 Then Shemuel \add asked\add* Yishay, “\add Is this all your sons\add*?”
\p “\add Well,\add* there’s just the youngest,” he \add answered\add* “\add but\add* you see, he’s \add out\add* \add looking after\add* the flock.”\f + \fr 16:11 \ft We deliberately left the word ‘flock’ here (rather than ‘sheep’), because although young David is always thought of as ‘the shepherd boy’ in English culture, in the middle-East, \bd goats\bd* are probably a more important part of the flock than sheep.\f*
\p “Send for him,” Shemuel \add instructed\add* \add him\add*, “because we won’t \add do anything else until he gets\add* here.”
\v 12 \add So\add* he sent for him and brought him in. He was a good-looker with beautiful eyes and red colouring, and Yahweh said, “\add Stand up\add* \add and\add* anoint him, because \add he’s the one\add*.”
\v 13 \add So\add* Shemuel took the horn \add full\add* of \add olive\add* oil and anointed him \add right there with\add* his brothers, and Yahweh’s spirit rushed onto David from that day onwards. Then Shemuel left and went \add home\add* to Ramah.

\v 14 \add Meanwhile,\add* Yahweh’s spirit left Sha’ul, and \add instead\add* an evil spirit from Yahweh tormented him,
\v 15 and \add his\add* servants told him, “Look, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you.
\v 16 Let our master please \add get your servants\add* to find a man who knows how to play the harp. \add Then, whenever\add* the evil spirit from God is on you, then he’ll play \add it\add* and it’ll be good for you.”
\p
\v 17 “\add Okay,\add*” Sha’ul \add responded\add*, “Find a man for me who’s good at playing \add it\add*, and bring him to me.”
\p
\v 18 Then one of his servants \add spoke up\add*, “Listen, I’ve \add noticed one of the sons\add* of Yishay \add in Bethlehem\add* who knows how to play. \add He’s also\add* \add a very powerful warrior\add*, as well as being \add good looking\add* and \add wise in what he says\add*. And Yahweh is with him.”
\p
\v 19 \add So\add* Sha’ul sent messengers to Yishay \add to tell him\add*, “Your son David who looks after your flock, send him to me.”
\v 20 \add So\add* Yishay loaded a donkey with bread, a skin of wine, and a young goat, and sent them to \add King\add* Sha’ul with his son David.
\v 21 \add When\add* David got to \add the king\add*, \add he became his servant\add*, and \add he was liked so much that he was appointed as the one who carried the king’s equipment\add*.
\v 22 Sha’ul sent \add a message back\add* to Yishay, saying, “Let David \add remain in my service\add*, because \add I really like him\add*.”
\v 23 Then whenever the spirit from God \add tormented\add* Sha’ul, David would take the harp and play it. \add That would bring\add* relief to Sha’ul and \add make him feel better\add*, and the evil spirit would \add leave\add* him.

\v 1 \add At that time,\add* the Philistines gathered their \add army\add* divisions together ready for battle. They assembled at Sokoh in Yehudah, and camped between Sokoh and Azekah in Efes-Dammim.
\v 2 Sha’ul and the Israeli \add warriors\add* gathered and camped in the Elah valley, then they arranged themselves for battle against the Philistines.
\v 3 \add So\add* the Philistines stood on one hill and \add the Israelis\add* on the \add opposite\add* hill, with the valley between them.
\p
\v 4 Then the Philistines \add sent a champion\add* out from their camp \add to represent them\add*. His name was Goliat and he came from Gat, and he was almost three metres\f + \fr 17:4 \ft Some Greek sources have a height closer to two metres.\f* \add tall\add*.
\v 5 He \add wore\add* a bronze helmet, and his body armour had \add overlapping plates\add* weighing \add a total of\add* some fifty-five kilograms.

\v 7 The wooden \add shaft of\add* his spear was like a weaver’s beam and his spear time weighed around seven kilograms. His shield-bearer walked in front of him.

\p
\v 12 \f + \fr 17:12 \ft Verses 12–31 aren’t included in every ancient Greek translation.\f*\add Now\add* David was the son of Yishay (from the Efrat clan, he lived in Bethlehem in Yehudah) who had eight sons, and by Sha’ul’s time, was quite old compared to other men.\f + \fr 17:12 \ft There’s a small variation in the original manuscripts at the end of the verse, but it has minimal effect on the essential story-line.\f*
\v 13 Yishay’s three oldest sons (Eliab, Abinadab, and Shammah) had gone to the battle with Sha’ul,
\v 14 \add but\add* David was the youngest. \add While\add* the three oldest \add were\add* with Sha’ul,
\v 15 David \add went back and forth between\add* Sha’ul\add ’s camp\add* and looking after his father’s flock at Bethlehem.
\p
\v 16 For forty days, the Philistine \add champion\add* came out and presented himself in the early morning and \add again\add* in the evening.
\p
\v 17 \add One day\add* Yishay said to his son David, “\add Here’s a sack\add* of roasted grain and ten loaves of bread. Take them straight away to your brothers at the camp.
\v 18 And take these ten cuts of cheese to the commander of \add their unit\add*. \add Find out how\add* your brothers \add are doing\add* and bring back \add anything they want to send to me\add*.
\v 19 Sha’ul and them and the \add other warriors\add* are in the Elah valley, fighting against the Philistines.”
\p
\v 20 \add So\add* David got up early in the morning and left the flock with a \add shepherd\add*, and set out just like Yishay had told him to. \add When\add* he got to the battleground and the camp, the \add warriors\add* were just going out to the battle line and they were shouting \add the battle cry\add*.
\v 21 The Israelis and the Philistines arranged \add themselves\add*—battle line to battle line.
\v 22 David left \add what he’d brought\add* with a \add guard\add*, and ran into the battle line. Then he \add caught up with\add* his brothers and asked \add them how they were doing\add*.
\v 23 \add While\add* he was talking with them, look, the Philistine \add champion\add* from Gat was coming out \add with his challenge\add*. Goliat spoke \add like he had before\add* and David \add heard it all\add*.
\v 24 \add But when\add* the Israelis saw the \add champion\add*, they were \add terrified\add* and fled \add away from him\add*.
\v 25 saying \add to each other\add*, “Have you seen this man who’s coming out? He’s certainly coming to mock Yisrael! Any man who can defeat him will be made very wealthy by the king, and he’ll give his daughter to him, plus \add his extended family will be exempt from paying taxes\add*.”
\p
\v 26 “What \add was it that’ll\add* be done for the man who \add kills\add* this Philistine and take’s Yisrael’s disgrace away?” David asked some of the men standing around him. “Because who does that uncircumcised Philistine \add think he is\add* that he would taunt the \add army\add* of the living God?”
\v 27 Then the \add men\add* told him \add again\add* what would be given to the man who \add defeats\add* him.
\p
\v 28 \add But when\add* David’s oldest brother Eliab heard him talking to the men, \add he got very angry\add* and \add scolded\add* him, “Why have you come down here? Who’s looking after those few sheep that you left in the desert? I know you \add have a big head\add* and \add you’re just a troublemaker\add*—you \add just\add* want to watch the battle.”
\p
\v 29 “What have I done now?” David \add asked\add*. “Wasn’t it \add just a question\add*?”
\v 30 Then he went over to another \add group\add* and \add asked the same question and got the same answer\add*.
\p
\v 31 \add So it got around what David was saying, and when Sha’ul heard about it\add*, he sent for him.
\v 32 David told \add the king\add*, “Don’t \add be discouraged\add*. Your servant will go and fight against this Philistine.”
\p
\v 33 “You can’t go against this Philistine and fight him,” Sha’ul told David. “You’re \add still\add* a lad, but he’s been a \add professional warrior since he was young\add*.”
\p
\v 34 “Your servant has been \add working\add* for his father tending the flock,” David \add replied\add*. “\add Sometimes\add* a lion or a bear has come and \add taken\add* a sheep from the flock
\v 35 and I would go after it and \add beat it\add* and rescue \add the sheep\add* from its mouth. If it \add went to attack\add* me, then I’d grasp it by the jaw and beat it and kill it.
\v 36 Your servant has \add killed\add* both a lion and a bear, and that uncircumcised Philistine will \add end up\add* \add just\add* like them, because he’s insulted the \add army\add* of the living God.”
\v 37 Then \add he\add* added, “Yahweh who has saved me from the lion and from the bear, \em he\em* will \add be the one to\add* save me from that Philistine.”
\p “Go \add then\add*, and Yahweh be with you.” Sha’ul \add assented\add*.
\v 38 Then Sha’ul \add had\add* David dressed in his \add own battle\add* attire, and then in body armour with a bronze helmet.
\v 39 David strapped his sword over \add the top\add* and then tried to walk because he hadn’t been trained \add in wearing it\add*. \add But\add* \add he\add* told Sha’ul, “I \add couldn’t walk in all that without practice\add*,” \add so\add* he took it \add all\add* off.
\v 40 Then he \add picked up\add* his staff, and selected five smooth stones from the riverbed. He placed them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag, and \add picked up\add* his sling and \add headed towards\add* the Philistine \add champion\add*.

\v 41 Then \add Goliat\add* came closer and closer to David, with his shield-bearer walking in front of him.
\v 42 When \add he\add* looked and \add realised\add* that David was a reddish, good-looking lad, he despised him
\v 43 and \add asked\add* \add him\add*, “Are you coming to me with a stick because you think I’m a dog?” Then the Philistine cursed David by his gods.
\v 44 “Come \add over here\add*,” \add he\add* told David, “and let me give your flesh to the \add vultures and wild animals\add*.”
\p
\v 45 “You’re coming to me with a sword and spear and dagger,” David \add shouted back\add*. “But I’m coming to you in the name of commander Yahweh, the God of Yisrael’s \add army\add* that you’ve been taunting.
\v 46 Today, Yahweh will \add help me defeat you\add* and I’ll knock you down and cut off your head. \add What’s more,\add* I’ll give the Philistine army corpses to the \add vultures and wild animals\add* today, then \add everyone\add* will know that there’s a God in Yisrael.
\v 47 \add Everyone here will learn\add* that Yahweh doesn’t save with swords or spears, because \add he’s\add* in charge of the battle and will \add help us defeat\add* you all.”
\p
\v 48 Then as \add Goliat\add* went closer to meet David, David ran quickly towards \add him\add* at the battle line.
\v 49 \add He\add* \add slipped\add* his hand into his bag and took out a single stone and slung it towards the Philistine—striking him on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead and he collapsed forwards onto the ground,
\v 50 and \add so\add* David defeated the Philistine with a sling and a stone—knocking him down and killing him. Not having a sword with him,\x + \xo 17:50: \xt 2Sam 21:19.\x*
\v 51 David ran and stood over the Philistine—drawing \add Goliat’s\add* sword out of its sheath to kill him and cut off his head.\x + \xo 17:51: \xt 2Sam 21:19.\x*
\p When the Philistines saw that their powerful champion was dead, they fled
\v 52 and the \add Israeli warriors started yelling\add* and they chased the Philistines into the valley and as far as the gates of Ekron. The \add dead bodies\add* of the Philistines \add could be seen\add* on the road all the way from Shaaraim to Gat and Ekron.
\v 53 \add When the Israelis\add* returned from chasing the Philistines, they \add raided the valuables\add* from their camp.
\v 54 David put \add Goliat’s\add* equipment into his \add own\add* tent, then he carried his head to Jerusalem.

\v 6 When \add they’d all\add* come back after killing the Philistine, the women from the Israeli cities had come out to meet King Sha’ul with singing and dancing—playing tambourines and \add other instruments with great happiness\add*.

\q1 “Sha’ul has \add killed\add* his thousands,

\v 9 \add So\add* from that day onwards, Sha’ul \add remained wary of David and kept an eye on him\add*.
\p
\v 10 Then the next day, an evil spirit from God rushed on Sha’ul and \add even\add* in the middle of the house he \add started\add* prophesying. As David was playing near him (as he did every day), Sha’ul was holding a spear
\v 11 and he \add suddenly\add* hurled \add it\add*, saying, “I’ll \add pin that David to\add* the wall.” \add But\add* twice when he did that, David \add managed to elude him\add*.

\v 12 \add So\add* Sha’ul \add ended up\add* afraid of David because Yahweh was with him, but \add was no longer with the king\add*.
\v 13 Then Sha’ul sent him \add out of the room\add* and appointed him as the commander of a thousand warriors, \add so\add* he came and went in front of the people.\f + \fr 18:13 \ft It’s not entirely clear what the implications of this coming and going were (and similarly at the end of v16).

\v 14 Yahweh was with David and he was succeeding in \add everything he did\add*.
\v 15 Sha’ul \add knew about his successes and couldn’t stand looking at him\add*,
\v 16 \add but all the people of\add* Yisrael and Yehudah loved David because \add they observed his comings and goings\add*.

\v 17 \add One day\add* Sha’ul told David, “Look, \add here’s\add* my oldest daughter Merab—I’ll give her to you for a wife. \add The only condition is that you\add* \add become a powerful warrior\add* for me and fight Yahweh’s battles.” (Sha’ul had said \add to himself\add*, “\add I don’t need to hurt him physically—I’ll let the Philistines do that\add* \add for me\add*.”)
\v 18 “Who am I,” David \add asked\add*, “and who are my relatives in my father’s clan in Yisrael, that I should become the king’s son-in-law?”
\p
\v 19 \add However,\add* when it was the time for Sha’ul to give his daughter Merab to David, she was given to Adriel the Meholathite \add to marry\add*.
\p
\v 20 \add Now\add* Sha’ul’s \add other\add* daughter Mikal loved David, and \add when\add* they told \add the king\add*, \add he was pleased about it\add*,
\v 21 \add saying\add* \add to himself\add*, “I’ll give her to him \add so\add* she can become a trap for him \add so\add* the Philistines \add could be the ones to attack\add* him.” \add So\add* he said a second time, “You’ll become a son-in-law of mine today.”
\v 22 Then Sha’ul commanded his servants, “Tell David privately, ‘Listen, the king is pleased with you, and all of us his servants love you. \add So\add* now \add we think that you should\add* become the king’s son-in-law.’ ”
\p
\v 23 \add So\add* they told David privately, \add but\add* \add he\add* \add responded\add*, “\add Something that significant isn’t likely to happen\add*. I’m \add hard up\add* and \add without much honour\add*.”
\p
\v 24 \add When\add* Sha’ul’s servants told him what David had said,
\v 25 he \add replied\add*, “\add Pass this onto\add* David, ‘The king \add doesn’t want an expensive\add* bride price—only a hundred Philistine foreskins taken from the king’s enemies.’ ” \add But\add* Sha’ul was \add still wanting\add* the Philistines \add to be the ones\add* \add to kill\add* David.
\v 26 \add Now when\add* David \add heard this from\add* the servants, \add he decided that he could indeed marry the king’s daughter within the time period that had been given\add*,
\v 27 \add so\add* he and his men \add got ready\add* and went and \add killed\add* \em two\em* hundred Philistine men. He brought them to the king and \add had them counted to fulfill the pledge\add*, and so Sha’ul \add had to\add* give his daughter Mikal to become his wife.
\p
\v 28 \add But when\add* Sha’ul \add realised\add* that Yahweh was \add helping\add* David, and that his daughter loved him,
\v 29 \add he became more\add* afraid of David, \add so he remained hostile\add* to David \add from then on\add*.

\v 4 \add So\add* \add the next morning,\add* Yonatan spoke well of David to his father Sha’ul, saying, “Don’t let the king sin against his servant, against David, because he hasn’t sinned against you, and actually, \add he’s been a big help\add* to you.
\v 5 He \add took his life into his hands when he fought against\add* \add Goliat\add*, and Yahweh \add used it to save\add* all Yisrael. \add So\add* why would you sin against innocent blood by putting David to death \add for no reason\add*.”
\p
\v 6 Sha’ul listened to Yonatan, then \add he\add* promised, “As surely as Yahweh lives, he won’t be put to death.”
\v 7 \add Afterwards,\add* Yonatan called David and told him \add what had been said\add*. Then he brought David back \add to work for\add* Sha’ul and \add things carried on as before\add*.

\v 9 \add One day\add* as Sha’ul was sitting in his house, an evil spirit from Yahweh \add came on him\add*. He had his spear in his hand, and David was playing \add the harp\add*.
\v 10 Sha’ul tried to hit David with the spear, but David eluded him and the spear went into the wall. Then David slipped away and fled that night.

\v 11 Sha’ul sent messengers to watch David’s house to \add kill\add* him in the morning, but his wife Mikal told \add him\add*, “If you don’t \add do something to\add* save your life tonight, you’ll be dead by tomorrow.”\x + \xo 19:11: \xt Psa 59 header.\x*
\v 12 \add So\add* Mikal lowered David out through the window, and he was able to slip out and take off.
\v 13 Then \add she\add* took a household idol and put it in the bed, putting a goats’ hair quilt \add where the head should be\add* and covering it with the \add bed-\add*clothes.
\v 14 \add When\add* Sha’ul sent messengers to \add arrest\add* David, she \add told\add* \add them\add*, “He’s sick.”
\v 15 Sha’ul sent the messengers \add back\add*, \add telling\add* \add them\add*, “Bring him up to me \add bed and all so I can kill him\add*.”
\v 16 \add But\add* when the messengers \add returned\add*, look, it was a household idol in the bed with a goats’ hair quilt as its head.
\v 17 Sha’ul \add had Mikal brought in and\add* \add questioned\add*, “Why did you deceive me like that and sent my enemy off, so that he slipped away?”
\p “He \add told me that he’d kill me\add*,” Michal \add answered\add* Sha’ul, “\add if I didn’t help him escape\add*.”
\p
\v 18 \add After\add* David had slipped away, he went to Shemuel in Ramah and told him everything that Sha’ul had done to him, then \add the two of them\add* went and stayed in Nayot.
\v 19 \add But\add* Sha’ul was told that David was in Nayot \add near\add* Ramah,
\v 20 \add so\add* \add he\add* sent messengers to \add capture\add* David. \add When\add* they saw a group of prophets prophesying and Shemuel standing \add as head\add* over them, God’s spirit came onto Sha’ul’s messengers and they also prophesied.
\v 21 They told Sha’ul and he sent more messengers and they also prophesied. \add He\add* sent messengers a third time, and they \add started\add* prophesying as well.
\v 22 \add Finally\add* Sha’ul \add himself\add* \add headed towards\add* Ramah and got as far as the large \add water\add* cistern in Seku. He asked \add around about\add* Shemuel and David, and \add was told that\add* they were in Nayot \add near\add* Ramah.
\v 23 \add So\add* he went to Nayot, and God’s spirit came on him as well. As he \add walked\add*, he \add kept\add* prophesying until he entered Nayot.
\v 24 He took off his \add outer\add* clothes and prophesied \add in front\add* of Shemuel. He lay \add undressed\add* all that day and all night, so \add that’s why\add* people ask, “Is Sha’ul a prophet as well?”\x + \xo 19:24: \xt 1Sam 10:11-12.\x*

\p
\v 1 Then David fled from Nayot \add near\add* Ramah and went to Yonatan and \add asked\add*, “What have I done? What did I do wrong? What sin \add has made your father so angry\add* that he \add wants to take\add* my life?”
\p
\v 2 “Far from it,” Yonatan \add responded\add*. “You won’t die. Listen, my father doesn’t do \add anything, big or small, without telling me\add*. \add So\add* why would my father hide this from me \add if it was his plan\add*? \add No,\add* \add you’re wrong\add*.”
\p
\v 3 “For sure, your father knows that \add you’ve taken a liking to me\add*,” said David, “and he \add would have decided not to tell you so you wouldn’t be upset\add*.” Then David made an oath again, “Indeed, as Yahweh is alive, and as your soul is alive, death \add is definitely only a step away from me\add*.”
\p
\v 4 “I’ll do anything for you—whatever you say,” Yonatan \add confirmed\add*.
\p
\v 5 “Listen, the new moon \add celebration\add* is tomorrow, and \add I’ll definitely be expected to\add* sit with the king to eat,” David told \add him\add*. “\add But\add* you \add should\add* let me go, and I’ll hide myself in the countryside until the third evening.\x + \xo 20:5: \xt Num 28:11.\x*
\v 6 If your father misses me, then tell \add him\add*, ‘David \add begged me to let him go to his home in\add* Bethlehem, to \add join his clan for their yearly\add* sacrifice.’
\v 7 If \add your father\add* says, ‘That’s fine,’ then your servant \add can relax\add*. \add But if he gets really angry\add*, \add you’ll know that he’s planning\add* evil.
\v 8 \add If that’s the case,\add* \add it’ll be up to you to do what’s right with your servant in terms of our agreement before\add* Yahweh. If \add I’ve been disloyal to the king,\add* kill me yourself—\add no need to drag me to him\add*.
\p
\v 9 “\add Don’t even think of it\add*,” Yonatan \add responded\add*. “If I find out that my father \add has decided to harm\add* you, I’ll \add certainly\add* tell you.”
\p
\v 10 “If your father \add does have a cruel plan\add*, who’ll tell me?” David \add asked\add* Yonatan.
\p
\v 11 “Come \add with me\add* out to the countryside.” Yonatan \add replied\add*. \add So\add* they went out to the countryside together
\v 12 and \add he\add* \add promised\add* David, “By Yahweh the God of Yisrael, I will definitely sound out my father around this time tomorrow, or \add soon after\add*. If \add it looks\add* good for \add you\add*, then I’ll certainly send \add a message to let you know\add*.
\v 13 \add But\add* if \add he’s\add* planning evil for you, may Yahweh punish me similarly or even worse if I don’t inform you, and send you away so you can leave in peace. And may Yahweh be with you just like he used to be with my father.
\v 14 \add But\add* as long as I’m still alive, please \add keep our\add* \add agreement of faithfulness before\add* Yahweh so I won’t die.
\v 15 Don’t ever \add terminate\add* that agreement of faithfulness towards my family, even when Yahweh \add destroys\add* your enemies \add wherever they are\add*.\x + \xo 20:15: \xt 2Sam 9:1.\x*
\v 16 \add So\add* Yonatan made a \add multi-generational\add* agreement with David, \add adding\add*, “And may Yahweh \add punish David’s enemies\add*.”
\p
\v 17 Then Yonatan got David to promise again because he loved him as much as he loved his \add own life\add*,
\v 18 and \add he\add* told him, “The new moon \add celebration\add* is tomorrow, and you’ll be missed because your seat will be empty.
\v 19 The following day, go to the place where you hid \add before\add* and stay by the \add big\add* rock.
\v 20 I’ll shoot three arrows to the side of it, as if \add trying to hit\add* a target.
\v 21 Then I’ll send \add my\add* boy to find the arrows. If I tell \add him\add* that they’re on my side, then just as Yahweh lives \add it’ll be safe for\add* you to come \add out\add*.
\v 22 \add But\add* if I tell the boy that they’re on the far side, go because Yahweh is sending you away.
\v 23 As for \add our pact\add*, Yahweh \add will watch over us and our descendants\add*.”
\p
\v 24 \add So\add* David hid himself in the countryside, and \add at\add* the new moon \add celebrations\add*, the king sat down to eat—
\v 25 sitting at his \add usual\add* seat by the wall. Yonatan \add sat opposite\add*, and Abner sat beside Sha’ul. \add No one was sitting in David’s seat\add*
\v 26 \add but\add* Sha’ul didn’t say anything that day, \add thinking\add*, “\add Something must have happened that made him\add* \add ceremonially\add* unclean.”
\v 27 \add However,\add* the next day of the \add celebration\add* when David was still missing, Sha’ul asked his son Yonatan, “Why didn’t Yishay’s son come to the meal yesterday or today?”
\p
\v 28 “David \add begged\add* me \add to let him go to\add* Bethlehem,” Yonatan answered.
\v 29 “He \add requested\add*, ‘Please \add release me\add* because our clan’s sacrifice will be in the city, and my brother has \add told me to be there\add*. \add So\add* now, if I’ve found favour in your eyes, please let me slip away and \add go to\add* see my brothers.’ \add That’s why\add* he hasn’t come to the king’s table.”
\p
\v 30 Sha’ul \add was furious at\add* Yonatan and \add yelled at\add* him, “\add You\add* son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do \add you think that\add* I don’t know that you’re \add taking the side of\add* Yishay’s son? It’s to your \add detriment\add* and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness,
\v 31 because as long as that son of Yishay stays alive on this earth, you and your kingdom will never be established. Now, send \add men\add* and \add arrest\add* him, because he’s \add on his way to the grave\add*!”
\p
\v 32 “Why should he be put to death?” Yonatan \add retorted\add*. “What \add wrong\add* has he done?”
\p
\v 33 Then Sha’ul hurled his spear at him to \add kill him\add*, and Yonatan knew \add then\add* that his father had \add already\add* \add determined to kill\add* David.
\v 34 Yonatan angrily got up from the table. He didn’t eat any food that second day of the \add celebration\add*—he was upset about David because his father had dishonoured him.\f + \fr 20:34 \ft It’s not entirely clear who this ‘him’ was (as Sha’ul had seriously dishonoured Yonatan as well), so we’ve left it ambiguous (although David was certainly the last name mentioned).\f*
\v 35 \add So it was that the following\add* morning, Yonatan went out to the countryside \add at the time agreed\add* with David, taking a small boy \add with him\add*.
\v 36 “Run \add ahead\add*—find the arrows that I’m about to shoot,” he told his boy. The boy ran and he shot the arrow to \add go over his head\add*.
\v 37 The boy went to where the arrow was, \add but\add* Yonatan called out, “Isn’t the arrow \add further past\add* you?”
\v 38 Then he \add added\add*, “\add Hurry up! Don’t mess around\add*.” \add So\add* the boy picked up the arrow and brought it back to his master,
\v 39 \add but\add* the boy didn’t \add realise what had just happened\add*—only Yonatan and David knew.
\v 40 Then Yonatan gave his equipment to the boy and \add sent him back to\add* the city.
\p
\v 41 \add When\add* the boy \add was gone\add*, David came up from the side and \add dropped onto his knees\add*, bowing three times with his face to the ground. Then they \add greeted each other with a kiss and cried together, although David cried the most\add*.
\v 42 Then Yonatan told David, “Go in peace, because us two have \add made a pact together\add* in Yahweh’s name, \add agreeing\add*, ‘Yahweh \add will watch\add* between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants forever.’ ” Then \add David\add* set off and Yonatan \add went back\add* to the city.

\v 1 David \add went\add* to the priest Ahimelek at Nob, \add but\add* Ahimelek trembled \add when he saw\add* David and \add asked\add* him, “Why are you \add here\add* by yourself? \add How come you don’t have a companion\add*?”\x + \xo 21:1-6: \xt Mat 12:3-4; Mrk 2:25-26; Luk 6:3.\x*
\p
\v 2 “The king \add sent me on an errand\add*,” David \add replied\add*, “\add but\add* he told me \add not to tell anyone about the matter that he sent me on\add*. \add Plus\add* I’ve \add told my young men where to meet me\add*.
\v 3 \add Now, what food do you have on\add* hand? Give me five loaves of bread or whatever you can find.”
\p
\v 4 “There is no ordinary bread \add on\add* hand,” the priest answered. “But there is the sacred bread, if only the young men have kept themselves from women.”
\p
\v 5 “\add There’s definitely been no women near us for\add* three days,” David told the priest. “\add That’s how I always do missions\add*. The men\f + \fr 21:5 \ft The Hebrew says ‘the men’s vessels’ (or ‘containers’). It’s not culturally clear if that referred to their ‘bodies’ (as this translation implies) or to something they carried.\f* have been pure, even though it was a common journey, and today \add even more so\add*.”
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* the priest gave him the sacred bread, because there was no other bread there other than the \add previous day’s\add* bread of the presence which had been removed from \add in front\add* of Yahweh to be replaced by fresh bread.\x + \xo 21:6: \xt Lev 24:5-9.\x*
\p
\v 7 \add Now it so happened\add* that one of Sha’ul’s servants was there that day \add presenting himself to\add* Yahweh. He was Doeg the Edomite, a \add leader\add* of Sha’ul’s herdsmen.
\p
\v 8 David \add asked\add* Ahimelek, “\add Do you have\add* any spear or sword here? \add I didn’t have time to grab my sword or my weapons when I left\add*, because the king’s matter was urgent.”
\p
\v 9 “\add I’ve only got\add* Goliat’s sword,” \add replied\add* the priest. “\add From\add* the Philistine who you \add killed\add* in the Elah valley.

\v 11 Then the king \add summoned\add* Ahitub’s son Ahimelek and all his relatives who were priests to Nob, and they all came to the king.
\v 12 “Listen now, son of Ahitub,” said Sha’ul.
\p “\add Go ahead\add* my master,” \add answered\add* Ahimelek.
\p
\v 13 “Why have you all conspired against me?” asked Sha’ul. “You gave bread to Yishay’s son, and a sword, and you \add asked guidance from\add* God for him, \add so now\add* he’s risen up against me—lying in ambush this very day?”
\p
\v 14 “\add Isn’t David one of your most\add* faithful servants?” Ahimelek answered the king. “He’s the king’s son-in-law and commander over your guards, and isn’t he honoured in your house?
\v 15 Did I begin to inquire for him from God today? Far be it from me! Don’t let the king \add accuse\add* his servant or any of my father’s household, because your servant doesn’t know about any of this—\add nothing at all\add*.”
\p
\v 16 “For certain, Ahimelek,” the king \add declared\add*. “you and all your father’s household will certainly die \add for that\add*!”
\v 17 Then the king \add commanded\add* his messengers who were stationed beside him, “Turn around and put Yahweh’s priests to death because \add they’ve taken David’s side\add*. And because they knew he was fleeing, but they didn’t \add inform me\add*.” \add But\add* the king’s servants weren’t willing to attack Yahweh’s priests.
\v 18 \add So\add* the king \add commanded\add* Doeg the Edomite, “You turn around and attack the priests.” \add So\add* Doeg turned and he himself attacked the priests. He \add killed\add* eighty-five men that day who \add wore\add* sacred linen aprons.

\p “Go and attack the Philistines and save Ke’ilah,” Yahweh \add responded\add*.

\v 5 Then David and his men went to Ke’ilah and battled against the Philistines—\add thoroughly defeating\add* them and taking their livestock, \add thus\add* saving the inhabitants of Ke’ilah.
\p
\v 6 \add Now\add* when Ahimelek’s son Evyatar had fled to David at Ke’ilah, he’d \add brought\add* a sacred apron \add with him\add*.

\v 21 “May you all be blessed by Yahweh,” Sha’ul responded, “because you’ve had compassion on me.
\v 22 Please go back and \add double-check\add* and \add find out\add* who’s seen him there. \add Learn more\add* and \add look at the place yourselves\add*, because I’ve been told that he’s very crafty.

\v 1 \add After\add* Sha’ul returned from \add repelling\add* the Philistines, they told him that David was \add now\add* in the Eyn-Gedi wilderness.
\v 2 \add So\add* Sha’ul \add chose\add* three thousand \add Israeli warriors\add* and went \add searching\add* for David and his men at Wild Goats Rocks.
\v 3 On the way, as \add they\add* reached the sheep yards, Sha’ul \add went into a cave to relieve himself, but\add* David and his men were \add hiding there further inside\add* the cave.\x + \xo 24:3: \xt Psa 57 header; Psa 142 header.\x*
\v 4 David’s men \add whispered\add* to him, “Wow, today what Yahweh told you \add is coming true\add* \add when he said\add*, ‘Listen, I’m about to give \add victory over your enemy\add*, and you will do to him \add whatever you think is right\add*.’ ” Then David \add sneaked up\add* and \add quietly\add* cut \add a piece\add* off the edge of Sha’ul’s robe.
\v 5 \add Afterwards\add* \add however,\add* David \add felt bad because\add* he’d cut \add a piece\add* off Sha’ul’s \add clothes\add*
\v 6 and he said to his men, “\add By Yahweh, I shouldn’t have done that\add* to my master—to Yahweh’s anointed \add king\add*—to \add do him harm\add* because he’s the \add one\add* Yahweh anointed.”\x + \xo 24:6: \xt 1Sam 26:11.\x*
\v 7 \add He\add* restrained his men with \add a few quiet\add* words and \add wouldn’t allow them to attack\add* Sha’ul.
\p Then Sha’ul left the cave and \add headed down the path\add*.
\v 8 After \add waiting a few moment\add*, David went out of the cave and called out behind Sha’ul, “My master the king.” \add When\add* Sha’ul turned and looked behind him, David bowed
\v 9 and said, “Why do you listen to \add people when they say that I’m wanting to harm you\add*?
\v 10 Look, \add you can see for yourself\add* that Yahweh gave \add me the opportunity to harm\add* you today in the cave, and some \add of my men\add* wanted me to kill you, but I \add showed you\add* compassion and \add told them that\add* I wouldn’t \add do harm to\add* my master, because he’s Yahweh’s \add chosen king\add*.
\v 11 \add Your majesty, look of this piece of your robe that I’m holding\add*, because when I cut it off, I didn’t kill you. \add So now you can see for yourself that I have no evil plans, and I haven’t do you any wrong, even though\add* you’re \add ambushing me so you can kill me\add*.
\v 12 May Yahweh judge between you and me \add because I’ll let Yahweh repay you for any harm against me—it won’t be me who works\add* against you.
\v 13 As the ancient proverb says, ‘Evil things are done by evil people.’ \add But it won’t be me who harms\add* you.
\v 14 Who has Yisrael’s king come \add to find\add*? Who are you chasing after? A dead dog? A flea?\x + \xo 24:14: \xt 1Sam 26:20.\x*
\v 15 May Yahweh \add take his judgement seat\add* and judge between me and you, and may he see my case and \add find me innocent and save me from you\add*.”
\p
\v 16 \add When David finished saying that to Sha’ul, Sha’ul called back\add*, “Is that your voice, my son David?” Then \add he\add* \add cried loudly\add*
\v 17 and told David, “You’re more righteous than I \add am\add*, because you \add were\add* good to me \add even when I\add* did evil \add things\add* to you.
\v 18 You’ve \add stated\add* that you’ve \add treated me well\add*—how Yahweh \add gave you the advantage over me, yet\add* you didn’t kill me.
\v 19 \add Now\add* if a man finds his enemy \add unprepared\add*, does he \add just\add* \add send him off happily\add*? \add Well,\add* may Yahweh reward you for \add your mercy towards\add* me today.
\v 20 Now listen, I know for certain that you’re going to \add become king\add* and that the kingdom of Yisrael will \add prosper under your leadership\add*.
\v 21 Now \add promise\add* me by Yahweh that you won’t \add destroy my name from my family line by killing my descendants\add*.”
\v 22 David promised \add that\add* to Sha’ul, then Sha’ul \add went back home\add* and David and his men returned to \add their\add* stronghold.

\s1 David, Nabal, and Abigil
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add Later on,\add* Shemuel died and all \add the Israelis\add* gathered and mourned for him, then they buried him at his house in Ramah.
\p Then David left and went to the Paran wilderness.
\v 2 \add Now\add* there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel. \add He owned\add* three thousand sheep and one thousand goats, and was \add busy\add* shearing his sheep at Carmel.
\v 3 The man’s name was Nabal, and his wife was Abigail. The wife was \add wise and very good-looking, whereas\add* the man (who was a Calebite) was harsh and cruel.
\p
\v 4 \add While\add* David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep,
\v 5 \add so he told\add* ten young men, “Go to Nabal at Carmel and \add greet\add* him in my name.
\v 6 Then tell him, ‘\add Make you live long\add*. Peace to you and your \add household\add* and \add everything that belongs to\add* you.
\v 7 Now I’ve heard those shearers \add are working for\add* you, and your shepherds have been \add living\add* with us. We haven’t harmed them or \add taken anything of theirs\add* while they’ve been in Carmel.
\v 8 Ask your \add servants\add* and they’ll \add confirm this\add*. May \add these\add* young men \add enjoy your\add* favour because \add harvesting the wool\add* is a \add prosperous time\add*, so I request a gift for your servants and for your ‘son’, David.’ ”
\p
\v 9 \add So\add* David’s men went and \add passed all that onto\add* Nabal, and then \add waited for his response\add*.
\v 10 \add But\add* Nabal answered \add them\add*, “\add Why should I care about\add* David? Yishay’s son \add isn’t anyone important\add*. There’s lot of servants \add these days\add* who are \add on the run from their\add* \add masters\add*.
\v 11 This bread and water, and the meat that I’ve \add butchered\add*, is for my shearers. Why should I give it to men when I don’t even know where they’re from?”
\p
\v 12 David’s men \add left\add* and returned \add to inform him what\add* \add Nabal\add* \add had been said\add*.
\v 13 Then David told his men, “Strap on \add your swords\add*.” \add So David took\add* around four hundred men, \add leaving\add* around two hundred with \add their\add* gear.
\p
\v 14 \add Meanwhile\add*, Nabal’s wife Abigail had been informed by a \add servant\add*, “Listen, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, \add but\add* he yelled at them.
\v 15 \add Their\add* men had been very good to us—we were never harmed or \add had anything go missing\add* when we were in the countryside.
\v 16 They \add protected\add* us both day and night \add for the whole time that we were\add* tending the sheep.
\v 17 \add So\add* now \add you should think about it and decide what you can do\add*, because \add no doubt\add* \add disaster is about to hit\add* our master and all his household. He’s a \add terrible man who listens to no one\add*.”
\p
\v 18 \add So\add* Abigail quickly \add collected\add* two hundred loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five butchered sheep, a large basket of roasted grain, a hundred bunches of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs. She loaded \add it all\add* on donkeys
\v 19 and told her \add servants\add*, “\add Go ahead\add* \add with the donkeys\add*. I’ll come \add along\add* behind you all.” \add But she didn’t say a word to\add* her husband Nabal.
\p
\v 20 \add As she rode down a hill and into the ravine, suddenly\add* she encountered David and his men coming down to meet her.
\v 21 David had told \add them\add*, “\add Well\add* \add it was certainly a waste of time looking after that fellow in the wilderness\add*, and \add taking such care not to take anything of his\add*. Then \add all he did was to return insults for our good behaviour\add*.
\v 22 May God \add preserve\add* \add my\add* enemies, if I \add don’t eliminate\add* all of the \add older and young men in his household before\add* the morning.
\p
\v 23 \add When\add* Abigail saw David, she \add quickly dismounted\add* from the donkey and fell \add to her knees in front\add* of David and bowed \add her face\add* to the ground.
\v 24 She \add clutched\add* his feet and said, “My master, \add let the guilt be\add* on me myself. Please let your female servant \add explain to you\add*—\add please\add* \add listen to what\add* your female servant \add has to say\add*.
\v 25 My master, please \add don’t remain angry at that worthless\add* man, Nabal. His name \add means ‘fool’\add* and so he is. \add He’s a senseless man, but\add* my master, your female servant didn’t see the young men you sent.
\v 26 And now, my master, as Yahweh lives and as your spirit lives, it’s Yahweh who’s \add prevented you from spilling blood and taking his punishment into your own hands\add*. And now may your enemies and \add anyone who makes plans\add* against my master be like Nabal.
\v 27 Now let this gift that your servant has brought to my master be given to the young men \add who serve\add* my master.
\v 28 Please forgive your female servant \add for being forward\add* because Yahweh will certain \add advance my master’s reputation\add*. My master is fighting Yahweh’s battles and \add all your life, you haven’t broken the law\add*.
\v 29 \add Even if someone decides to chase you and try to kill you my master, your God Yahweh will keep you wrapped in his\add* bundle of the living, \add whereas\add* your enemies will be \add slung away like stones from a sling\add*.
\v 30 If Yahweh does \add all the good things he’s promised\add* for my master, then \add in time\add* you’ll become Yisrael’s ruler.
\v 31 \add It would be good not to have someone’s unnecessary death\add* as an obstacle for you or \add to be seen as\add* my master \add just\add* saving \add his own skin\add*. Then Yahweh will \add bless\add* my master, and you will \add appreciate\add* your female servant.”
\p
\v 32 “May Yisrael’s God Yahweh be blessed,” David \add responded\add*. “\add The one\add* who sent you to meet me today.
\v 33 And blessed be your discernment and blessed be you \add yourself\add*, \add because you’ve prevented me from shedding blood today\add* and from \add taking my own revenge\add*.
\v 34 \add Yes\add* indeed, as Yahweh lives, Yisrael’s God \add prevented me from harming\add* you. If you hadn’t hurried here to meet me, certainly \add neither Nabal nor any of his older or young men would have survived\add* \add to see\add* the morning light.
\v 35 Then David \add accepted the gifts that\add* she had brought for him, and said, “Go \add back\add* to your house in peace. See, I’ve listened to \add what you said and granted your request\add*.”
\p
\v 36 \add When\add* Abigail \add got home\add* to Nabal, wow, \add he had put on a celebration\add* at his house \add with a feast fit for\add* a king. \add He was feeling very contented and was quite\add* drunk, \add so\add* she didn’t tell him \add anything at all\add* until it was light in the morning.
\v 37 And so it was in the morning, when Nabal’s wine \add had worn off\add*, his wife told him \add what she’d done\add*. \add In his rage,\add* \add he had a stroke and became totally paralysed\add*
\v 38 for about then days. Then Yahweh struck Nabal and he died.
\p
\v 39 \add When\add* David heard that Nabal had died, he said, “Blessed be Yahweh, who has \add judged\add* the case of \add Nabal’s insult\add* and has \add prevented\add* his servant from \add doing the wrong thing\add*. And Yahweh has \add repaid Nabal for his own evil\add*.”
\p Then David sent \add messengers\add* to Abigail \add about\add* taking her as a wife.
\v 40 \add His\add* servants went to \add her\add* at Carmel and told her, “David sent us to take you \add back\add* to become his wife.”
\p
\v 41 She \add knelt down with her face to the ground and replied\add*, “See, your female servant is \add ready\add* for washing the feet of my master’s servants like a slave woman.”
\v 42 Then Abigail and five of her servant girls quickly \add got ready\add*, and she mounted the donkey. She followed the messengers to \add where David was\add* and became a wife for him.
\p
\v 43 David had also married Ahinoam from Yizre’el, \add so\add* both of them became his wives.
\v 44 (\add Meanwhile\add* Sha’ul had given his daughter, David’ wife Mikal, to Palti, Layish’s son from Gallim.)\x + \xo 25:44: \xt 2Sam 3:14-16.\x*

\s1 David spares Sha’ul again
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add One time some\add* Zifites went to Sha’ul at Gibeah and told \add him\add*, “Isn’t David hiding himself on the Hakilah hill \add opposite\add* Yeshimon?”\x + \xo 26:1: \xt Psa 54 header.\x*
\v 2 \add So\add* Sha’ul got ready with three thousand chosen Israeli warriors and went to the Zif wilderness to search for David.
\v 3 \add They\add* camped at Hakilah hill (\add opposite\add* Yeshimon) by the path, \add but\add* David stayed in the wilderness \add when\add* he saw the Sha’ul was \add there trying to get\add* him.
\v 4 (\add He’d\add* sent some spies and knew that Sha’ul had definitely \add arrived\add*.)
\v 5 \add That night,\add* David \add moved out\add* and \add got\add* to the place where Sha’ul had camped. \add He\add* \add could see where Sha’ul was sleeping\add*, along with Ner’s son Abner, his army commander. Sha’ul was \add asleep in the secure centre\add* with his \add warriors\add* all around him.
\p
\v 6 David spoke to Ahimelek (the Hittite) and to Abishai (son of Yoab’s brother Tseruiah) \add asking\add*, “Who’ll go into the camp with me to Sha’ul?”
\p Abishai \add answered\add*, “I will. I’ll go with you.”
\p
\v 7 \add So that night\add* David and Abishai \add crept into the camp\add*. Sha’ul was asleep \add there in the centre\add* with his spear stuck into the ground near his head, and Abner and \add others\add* were lying \add in a circle\add* around him.
\v 8 Abishai \add whispered\add* to David, “Today God has \add arranged for you to defeat\add* your enemy. \add So\add* please let me pierce him now with the spear \add through him and\add* into the ground. \add Only one strike will do it\add*—I won’t have to \add strike him a second time\add*.
\p
\v 9 “Don’t \add kill\add* him,” David \add responded\add*, “because who \add can attack\add* Yahweh’s anointed \add king\add* and \add be considered\add* innocent?”
\v 10 As Yahweh lives, he will certainly strike him, or \add else\add* his \add time\add* will come and he’ll die, or \add maybe\add* he’ll go into battle and be swept away.
\v 11 \add May\add* Yahweh \add prevent me from harming\add* Yahweh’s anointed one.\x + \xo 26:11: \xt 1Sam 24:6.\x* \add Just grab\add* the spear that’s by his head, and the jug of water, then \add we can get out of here\add*.”
\v 12 \add So\add* David took the spear and water jug that were near Sha’ul’s head and then \add got out of there\add*. No one saw them, and no one woke up or realised, because Yahweh had \add caused them all to fall into\add* a deep sleep.
\p
\v 13 Then David \add crossed the valley\add* and stood on the top of the \add opposite\add* hill—\add quite a distance away\add*
\v 14 and called out to Abner and \add the camp\add*, “Won’t you answer, Abner?”
\p “Who are you that’s \add shouting\add* to the king?” Abner answered.
\p
\v 15 “Aren’t you a \add warrior\add*?” David \add called out\add*. “And who in Yisrael is \add as good as\add* you? But why didn’t you watch over your master the king? Because one of the people came to destroy the king your master.
\v 16 \add Your performance\add* wasn’t good. As Yahweh lives, all of you who \add were supposed to be\add* watching over your master, over Yahweh’s anointed one, \add deserve to be executed\add*. \add Look around,\add* where’s the king’s spear and water jug that were \add by\add* his head?”
\p
\v 17 Then Sha’ul recognised David’s voice and \add called back\add*, “Is that your voice, my son David?”
\p “\add Yes,\add* it is my voice, my master the king.” David \add replied\add*.
\v 18 Then he asked, “Why is my master chasing his servant? What have I done? \add What wrong am I guilty of\add*?
\v 19 Now please listen, my master the king, to your servant’s words. If it’s Yahweh who’s incited you against me, may he \add accept\add* an offering, but if it’s \add people\add*, may they be cursed \add in front\add* of Yahweh because they’ve driven me away from \add enjoying Yahweh’s inheritance for me\add*,\f + \fr 26:19 \ft This is possibly referring to David not being able to enjoy his piece of land, but we haven’t said that in the translation because it’s not certain. (It could be referring to having a peaceful or prosperous life, for example.)\f* saying, ‘Go \add away and\add* serve other gods.’
\v 20 \add So\add* now, don’t let \add me die far\add* from Yahweh’s \add presence\add*. \add It seems that\add* Yisrael’s king has come \add all this way\add* to chase a flea, just like someone chases a \add wild bird\add* in the hills.”
\p
\v 21 Sha’ul \add responded\add*, “\add Yes,\add* I’ve sinned. \add Go home\add*, my son David. I won’t \add wrong\add* you again, because \add you spared my life today\add*. \add Yes\add*, I’ve acted foolishly and \add been following the wrong path\add*.”
\p
\v 22 “Look, \add here’s your\add* spear.” David \add called back\add*. “Get one of \add your\add* young men \add to come across\add* and get it.
\v 23 May Yahweh \add repay each person for their obedience\add* and faithfulness. Yahweh \add put you in a vulnerable position\add* today, but I wasn’t willing to \add hurt\add* Yahweh’s anointed \add king\add*.
\v 24 Just as \add I honoured\add* your life today, so \add to\add* may Yahweh \add honour\add* my life and rescue me from all \add my difficulties\add*.
\p
\v 25 “May you be blessed, my son David,” Sha’ul told David. “You certainly \add have both ability and the skill to use it\add*.”
\p Then David went on his way and Sha’ul \add went back home\add*.

\s1 David among the Philistines

\p
\v 1 \add But\add* David \add thought to himself\add*, “\add One of these days, I’m going to be caught off-guard by Sha’ul’s actions\add*. There’s no \add future\add* for me \add here\add*, \add so\add* I definitely \add need to\add* slip away to the Philistines region. Then \add hopefully\add* Sha’ul will \add give up looking for\add* me again \add across\add* all Yisrael, and I’ll slip \add be able to stay under his radar\add*.”
\v 2 \add So\add* \add he\add* \add left\add* \add Israel\add* and crossed over with his six hundred men to Gat \add and\add* King Akish (Maok’s son).
\v 3 Then David and his men \add settled\add* with Akish in Gat. David had his two wives Ahinoam (from Yezreel) and Abigail (\add widow\add* of Nabal from Carmel) with him.
\v 4 \add When\add* Sha’ul was told that David had fled to Gat, he \add stopped\add* searching for him.
\p
\v 5 \add One day,\add* David \add asked\add* Akish, “If I’ve found favour in your eyes, \add ask\add* them to give me a place in one of the cities in the countryside \add so\add* I can live there. \add There’s no need for us to bludge on you here in the royal city\add*.”
\v 6 \add So\add* Akish gave Tsiklag to \add David\add* that day, \add and\add* as a result, it still belongs to Yehudah’s kings until today.
\p
\v 7 David \add ended up\add* living in the Philistine countryside for \add around\add* \add sixteen\add* months,
\v 8 and \add during that time\add*, \add he\add* would take his men to raid the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites. They had lived in \add that region from long before\add*—from Shur \add all the way to\add* Egypt.
\v 9 When David \add attacked a place\add*, he would take the sheep and cattle, donkeys and camels, and clothes, \add but\add* he didn’t leave \add anyone\add* alive. Then he’d return home and \add visit\add* Akish.
\v 10 \add The king\add* would ask him, “\add Which place\add* did you raid today?”
\p David would tell \add him\add*, “In southern Yehudah,” or “South of the Yerahmeelites,” or “In the southern Kenite \add region\add*”.
\v 11 David never allowed any man or woman to live to be able to go back to Gat and report on what he’d \add really\add* been doing. \add That was how he handled things for the entire time\add* that he lived in the Philistine countryside.
\v 12 \add But\add* \add King\add* Akish was trusting David, \add thinking\add*, “He’ll definitely \add be hated\add* \add now by\add* his people in Yisrael, \add so\add* he’ll \add be forced to remain here as my\add* servant.”

\s1 Sha’ul consults a medium
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add Some time later,\add* the Philistines gathered their \add forces\add* \add getting ready\add* to battle against Yisrael, and \add King\add* Akish \add complimented\add* David, “\add We’ll definitely want you and your men to join with our forces\add*.”
\p
\v 2 “\add Sounds good\add*,” David \add replied\add*, “\add because you’ll be able to see for\add* yourself what your servant can do.”
\p “I’ll appoint \add as my permanent bodyguard\add*,” Akish told \add him\add*.
\p
\v 3 \add By now, Shemu’el was long dead\add* and all Yisrael had mourned for him and had buried him in his town of Ramah, and Sha’ul had had expelled all the mediums from the country, \add along with those who contacted the spirits\add*.\x + \xo 28:3: \xt 1Sam 25:1.\x*
\p
\v 4 Then the Philistines went to Shunem and camped \add there\add*. \add Meanwhile\add* Sha’ul gathered all Yisrael’s \add warriors\add* and they camped at Gilboa,
\v 5 \add but when\add* he saw the Philistine camp, he was afraid and trembled \add inside\add*.
\v 6 He asked Yahweh \add for direction\add*, but Yahweh didn’t answer him either through \add a dream\add*, nor by \add use of\add* the sacred pouch, nor through \add any prophet\add*.\x + \xo 28:6: \xt Num 27:21.\x*
\v 7 Then Sha’ul \add instructed\add* his servants, “Find a woman for me who \add talks to the spirits of dead people\add*, \add so\add* I can go to her and \add ask\add* her \add something\add*.”
\p “Sure,” his servants told him, “there’s a woman in Endor \add who can do that\add*.”
\p
\v 8 \add So\add* Sha’ul put on different clothes to disguise himself, and went off in the night with two of his men. They went to the woman and he \add asked\add*, “Please divine for me with a spirit of the dead and bring up the person that I tell you.”
\p
\v 9 “Listen,” said the woman, “surely you’re aware of what Sha’ul has done—he’s expelled anyone out of the country brings back the dead or converses with the spirits. \add So\add* why are you trying to trap me? Are you trying to get me killed?”
\p
\v 10 Sha’ul promised her \add in front of\add* Yahweh, “As Yahweh lives, you \add won’t be punished for doing this\add*.”
\p
\v 11 “\add Okay\add* then, who \add do you want me to\add* bring up for you?”
\p “Bring Shemuel up for me.” he \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 12 \add When\add* the woman saw Shemuel, she yelled out and said to Sha’ul, “\add Oh no,\add* you’ve tricked me! You’re Sha’ul!”
\p
\v 13 “Don’t be afraid,” said the king, “but what have you seen?”
\p “I saw gods coming up out of the ground,” she replied.
\p
\v 14 “What does he look like?” he \add asked\add*.
\p “An old man’s appearing,” she said, “wearing a robe.”
\p Sha’ul knew it was Shemuel, and he \add knelt down\add* and bowed \add his face\add* to the ground.
\p
\v 15 “Why’ve you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Shemuel \add asked\add*.
\p “I’m very distressed,” Sha’ul \add replied\add*, “and the Philistines are about to go to war against me. And God has turned away from me and doesn’t answer me anymore—\add he hasn’t sent me any\add* prophets or \add given me any\add* dreams, \add So\add* I’ve called to you \add so you can tell me\add* what I should do.”
\p
\v 16 “If Yahweh’s turned away from you and become your enemy,” Shemuel \add responded\add*, “\add what’s the point in\add* asking me?”
\v 17 \add He’s\add* \add simply\add* \add done what he told me to tell you that he’d do\add*. He’s ripped the kingdom \add away from you\add* and given it to your neighbour David.\x + \xo 28:17: \xt 1Sam 15:28.\x*
\v 18 You didn’t \add do what Yahweh instructed\add* and you didn’t execute his \add anger\add* against Amalek, so that’s why Yahweh is doing that to you today.\x + \xo 28:18: \xt 1Sam 15:3-9.\x*
\v 19 \add He\add* will also \add allow Yisrael to be defeated by\add* the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be \add here\add* with me. Yahweh will also \add allow\add* Yisrael’s \add entire\add* camp \add of warriors\add* \add to be captured by\add* the Philistines.”
\p
\v 20 Sha’ul, \add who’d been standing\add* immediately \add toppled right over and crashed\add* to the ground—he was very scared by Shemuel’s words, plus he \add didn’t have much strength\add* because he hadn’t eaten for \add twenty-four hours\add*.
\v 21 The woman \add knelt over\add* Sha’ul and saw that he was terrified, and told him, “\add Listen to me\add*. Your female servant has \add risked my life to do what you said and follow your instructions\add*.
\v 22 \add So\add* now, \add although you’re the king\add*, please listen to your female servant. Let me get you some food, and then eat it \add to regain your strength for the journey\add* \add home\add*.
\p
\v 23 \add But\add* he refused, saying, “\add No,\add* I won’t eat \add anything\add*.” \add However\add* his servants and also the woman urged him, and he \add decided to take their advice\add* \add so\add* he got up from the ground and sat on the bed.
\v 24 \add Now\add* the woman had a calf in a stall at the house, and she quickly slaughtered it, She took flour and kneaded it and baked flat bread.
\v 25 She \add placed the food in front\add* of Sha’ul and his servants, and they ate \add before\add* getting up and going out into the night.

\s1 The Philistines don’t trust David
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add Meanwhile,\add* the Philistines had gathered \add in\add* their camp at Afek, \add while\add* the Israelis were camped \add near\add* the Yezreel spring.
\v 2 As the Philistine leaders \add marched out groups of\add* hundreds and thousands, David and his men were behind them with \add King\add* Akish.
\v 3 \add But\add* the Philistine commanders \add asked\add*, “What are those Hebrews \add doing here\add*?”
\p “\add That’s\add* David,” Akish \add replied\add*. “He was the servant of King Sha’ul of Yisrael, \add but he’s\add* been with me \add for over a year\add*, and I haven’t found anything \add distrustful\add* in him from \add when he lost favour\add* until today?”
\p
\v 4 \add But\add* the Philistine commanders were furious at him and told him, “\add Send that man back to whatever place you’ve given him! There’s no way he’s joining us in the battle! What if he turned against us during the fight? What better way could he have to win back his master’s favour than by killing our\add* men?
\v 5 Isn’t this the David that when they dance they sing,\x + \xo 29:5: \xt 1Sam 18:7; 21:11.\x*
\q1 ‘Sha’ul has struck down his thousands,
\q1 and David his ten thousands’?”
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* Achish called David and told him, “As Yahweh lives, \add you’ve definitely been honest\add*, and \add everything I’ve seen of your activities has been good\add*, because I haven’t \add seen you do anything wrong since the day you first arrived\add*. \add However, these rulers don’t approve of you\add*,
\v 7 \add so\add* turn back and go in peace \add so that you don’t do anything to displease\add* \add them\add*.”
\p
\v 8 “But what have I done?” David \add rebutted\add*. “What \add wrong\add* have you found in your servant from the day \add I arrived at your place until now\add*? Why can’t I come and fight against the enemies of my master the king?”
\p
\v 9 “\add All I know, is that as far as I’m concerned you’re as reliable\add* as a messenger from God.” Akish \add responded\add*. “Nevertheless, the Philistine commanders have said, ‘He \add can’t join our side\add* in the battle.’
\v 10 \add So\add* you and your master’s servants who came with you should \add get up with the early morning light and leave\add*.”
\p
\v 11 \add So\add* David and his men \add packed up\add* early in the morning to return to the Philistines region, \add but\add* the Philistine \add warriors\add* \add headed towards\add* Yezreel.

\s1 David pursues the Amalekites
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 David and his men \add got back\add* to Tsiklag \add three days later\add* and \add found that\add* the Amalekites had raided Tsiklag and \add other parts of the southern Judean wilderness\add*. They had \add attacked\add* Tsiklag then burnt \add it down\add*,
\v 2 capturing the women and children and everyone else. They hadn’t killed anyone, \add but\add* had taken them away \add with them\add*,
\v 3 \add so\add* when David and his men arrived at the town, wow, it had been burnt \add down\add* and their wives, and sons and daughters had been taken captive.
\v 4 David and his men cried loudly until \add they didn’t have the strength to cry any more\add*.
\v 5 Ahinoam (from Yezreel) and Abigail (Nabal’s \add widow\add* from Carmel), David’s two wives, had been taken captive \add with the others\add*.\x + \xo 30:5: \xt 1Sam 25:42-43.\x*
\p
\v 6 David \add was in a tight spot\add* because the \add men\add* \add were considering\add* \add throwing rocks at him to kill him\add*, because they were very upset about their \add children\add*, \add but\add* \add he\add* \add found strength\add* in his God Yahweh.
\v 7 Then David \add asked\add* the priest Evyatar (Ahimelek’s son), “Please \add get\add* the sacred apron \add and come back to me\add*.” \add So\add* Evyatar \add got\add* the sacred apron \add and went back\add* to David.\x + \xo 30:7: \xt 1Sam 22:20-23.\x*
\v 8 Then David asked Yahweh, “If I chase after \add these raiders, will I catch up to them\add*”
\p “Chase \add them\add* because you’ll definitely \add catch up\add* and you’ll certainly \add be able to rescue\add* \add the captives\add*,” \add Yahweh\add* \add answered\add*.
\p
\v 9 \add So\add* David and the six hundred men who were with him \add took off\add* and they reached the Besor riverbed, \add where some of the slower ones remained\add*.
\v 10 David and four hundred men continued, \add but\add* two hundred more of the men who were exhausted \add stopped\add* at \add the far end of\add* the Besor riverbed.
\v 11 They found an Egyptian man in the countryside and took him to David. They gave him \add water to drink\add* and bread to eat,
\v 12 along with a slice of fig cake and two raisin clusters. He ate it and \add felt stronger again\add* because he hadn’t eaten or drunk for three \add full\add* days.
\v 13 “Who do you belong to?” David \add asked\add*. “And where are you from?”
\p “I am an Egyptian,” he \add replied\add*. “I’m an Amalekite man’s slave \add but\add* my master left me three days ago because I got sick.
\v 14 We’d raided the southern area of the Kerethites as well as part of Yehudah and the south of Caleb. And we burnt \add down\add* Tsiklag.”
\p
\v 15 David asked him, “Can you \add lead us to them\add*?”
\p “I’ll take you to \add them\add*,” he answered, “\add if you\add* promise by God that you won’t \add kill\add* me and won’t \add hand me back over to\add* my master.”
\v 16 \add So\add* he took \add David\add* down \add to the plain\add*, and \add sure enough\add*, there were \add the Amalekites\add* spread out, eating and drinking and celebrating because of all the plunder that they had taken from the Philistine and Yehudah regions.
\v 17 David \add attacked\add* them from twilight until the evening of the next day, and none of \add the Amalekites\add* were able to escape except for four hundred young men who \add jumped\add* on camels and fled.
\v 18 \add So\add* David was \add able to\add* rescue everyone that the Amalekites had taken, \add including\add* his two wives.
\v 19 \add None of their\add* sons or daughters were missing, and \add they also recovered\add* \add all the animals and\add* all the plunder—nothing was missing—big or small.
\v 20 David took all the flocks and herds and they drove them in front of the other livestock, saying, “This is David’s spoil.”
\p
\v 21 Then David \add got back\add* to the two hundred men who’d been too exhausted to go \add all the way with them\add*. They’d stayed at the Besor riverbed, and they went out to meet David and his men. As David approached to \add greet\add* them,
\v 22 all the evil and worthless men who’d gone with David \add complained\add*, “Because they didn’t go with us, we won’t give them any of the plunder that we recovered, except that each man can get his wife and \add children\add* then take them away and leave.”
\p
\v 23 “\add No\add*, my brothers,” David said. “You won’t do that with what Yahweh has given to us. He’s \add protected\add* us and \add helped us defeat the raiders who\add* came against us.
\v 24 Who’ll listen to you all \add when you talk like that\add*? The portion for the ones who went \add and fought\add* will be the same as for those who stayed with the equipment. They’ll all \add share alike\add*.
\v 25 \add So\add* from that time onwards, it’s been a custom and law in Yisrael.
\s1 David distributes gifts
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 26 \add When\add* David got \add back\add* to Tsiklag, he sent \add a gift from\add* some of the plunder to the elders in Yehudah, telling \add them\add*, “Look, here’s a blessing for you—some of the spoil from Yahweh’s enemies.”
\v 27 \add Gifts were sent to:\add* those in Beyt-El, Ramot-Negev, Yattir,
\v 28 Aroer, Sifmot, Eshtemoa,
\v 29 Rakal, the cities of the Yerahmeelites and the Kenites,
\v 30 Hormah, Bor-Ashan, Atak,
\v 31 Hebron, and all the places where David and his men had \add been to\add*.

\s1 The death of Sha’ul and his sons
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (1 Chr. 10:1-12)
\p
\v 1 \add Meanwhile,\add* the Philistines were battling against Yisrael, and the \add Israelis\add* fled from the Philistines \add but\add* \add many\add* \add were killed\add* on Mt. Gilboa.
\v 2 The Philistines \add stayed hard on the tail of\add* Sha’ul and his sons, and they killed \add his\add* sons Yonatan, Abinadab, and Malki-Shua.
\v 3 Then the battle \add was fierce\add* around Sha’ul, then the \add Philistine archers sighted\add* him and he writhed in terrible pain \add from the arrows\add*.
\v 4 \add He\add* said to the \add man\add* carrying his equipment, “Draw out your sword and pierce me through with it, lest these uncircumcised \add Philistines\add* come and pierce me through then \add torture me as I’m dying\add*.” But the \add man\add* who carried his equipment was very scared and \add wouldn’t do it, so\add* Sha’ul took \add his\add* sword and fell on it.
\v 5 \add When\add* the \add man\add* carrying his equipment saw that \add the king\add* was dead, he too fell on his sword and died with him.
\v 6 \add So\add* Sha’ul, three of his sons, and the \add man\add* carrying his equipment all died on that same day, along with all his \add warriors\add*.
\v 7 \add When\add* the Israelis on the \add north\add* side of the \add Yezreel\add* valley and on the \add east\add* side of the Yordan saw that the \add Israeli warriors\add* had fled and that Sha’ul and his sons had \add been killed\add*, they left their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and lived in them.
\p
\v 8 The next day \add when\add* the Philistines came to strip \add anything valuable from\add* the \add bodies\add*, they found \add the bodies of\add* Sha’ul and his three sons \add there\add* on Mt. Gilboa.
\v 9 They cut off \add the king’s\add* head and \add took all his gear\add*. Then they sent \add messengers\add* all around the Philistine \add region to spread\add* \add their\add* good news to the \add temples\add* of their idols and to \add all\add* \add their\add* people.
\v 10 They \add Sha’ul’s\add* \add armour and weapons\add* in the temple of the Ashtorets, and hung his body on the Beyt-Shan \add city\add* wall.
\p
\v 11 \add When the residents of\add* Yabesh-Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul’s \add body\add*,
\v 12 all their \add warriors\add* walked all night to take Sha’ul’s body and those of his sons, off the wall at Beyt-Shan. They \add took them back\add* to Yabesh and burnt them there.
\v 13 Then they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Yabesh, and fasted for seven days.
