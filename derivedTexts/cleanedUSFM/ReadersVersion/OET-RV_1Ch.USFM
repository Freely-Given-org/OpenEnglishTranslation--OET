\is1 Introduction
\ip The \bk First\bk* and the \bk Second Account of Chronicles\bk* are a retelling of lots of what’s included in \bk The accounts about Shemuel (Samuel)\bk* and of \bk The accounts about the kings\bk*, but told in different words. There seem to be two primary purposes for this account:
\ip 1. So that the reader can learn more about the destruction of Yehudah (Judah) and Yisrael (Israel), as God fulfilled his promise and plans for his people. This writer illustrates the achievements of David, Shelomoh (Solomon), of Yehoshafat (Jehoshaphat), Hizkiyah (Hezekiah), of Yoshiyah (Josiah), along with other people who obeyed Yahweh’s instructions.
\ip 2. To document the division of the priests and Levites in preparation for their service in the soon-to-be-built temple for Yahweh, and the extensive preparations by King David that were eventually handed over to King Shelomoh. Yahweh had carefully instructed David about how he wanted the temple worship to operate, and then this was all written down and handed over to Shelomoh, who would be the one who would go on to construct the buildings and all the furnishings and equipment and utensils that were required for its functioning.

\v 39 and they went to the entrance of Gedor (to the east of the valley) in search of pasture for their flocks.
\v 40 They found good, \add fertile\add* pasture, and the land was \add wide\add*, and quiet and peaceful, because Ham’s \add descendants\add* had lived there \add previously\add*.
\p
\v 41 Those listed by name, went \add there\add* in the days of Yehudah’s King Hezekiah, and struck down the tents of the Meunites who were found there. They completely annihilated them (to this day), and they lived \add there\add* in their place because pasture for their flock was there.
\v 42 Then five hundred of their men who were descendants of Shimeon went to Mt. Seir, \add led\add* by Yishi’s sons Pelatyah, Nearyah, Refayah, and Uzziel.
\v 43 They \add also\add* struck down the rest of the Amalekites who escaped, and they’ve lived there to this day.

\v 5 Asayah and his sons (descendants of Shilon—Asayah was the oldest),

\p
\v 9 In all, there were 956 of Benyamin’s descendants living in Yerushalem. All those \add above\add* were leaders of their clans.
\p
\v 10 Some of the priests \add who returned to Yehudah\add* were: Yedayah, Yehoyariv, Yakin,
\v 11 Azaryah, the leading official at the temple (Azaryah was Hilkiyah’s son, Hilkiyah was Meshullam’s son, Meshullam was Tsadok’s son, Tsadok was Merayot’s son, Merayot was Ahituv’s son),
\v 12 Adayah (Yeroham’s son, Yeroham was Pashhur’s son, Pashhur was Malkiyah’s son), and Maasai (Adiel’s son, Adiel was Yahzerah’s son, Yahzerah was Meshullam’s son, Meshullam was Meshillemit’s son, Meshillemit was Immer’s son).

\s1 Levites who returned
\p
\v 14 From Levi’s descendants \add who returned to Yehudah there were\add*: Shemayah (Hasshuv’s son, Hasshuv was Azrikam’s son, Azrikam was Hashavyah’s son, Hashavyah was a descendant of \add Levi’s youngest son\add* Merari),

\p
\v 17 From Levi’s descendants who returned to Yehudah who guarded the temple gates there was Shallum, Akkuv, Talmon, Ahiman, and some of their relatives. Shallum was their leader.
\v 18 Those descendents of Levi were gatekeepers at the King’s Gate on the east \add even at the present time\add*.
\p
\v 19 Shallum was Kore’s son, Kore was Evyasaph’s son, and Evyasaph was Korah’s son. Shallum and his relatives from his clan (Korah’s descendants), had the duty of being gatekeepers, responsible to guard the entrances to Yahweh’s temple as their ancestors had done.
\v 20 \add Previously\add* Pinehas (Eleazar’s son) \add had supervised\add* the gatekeepers. Yahweh was with \add Pinehas\add*.
\p
\v 21 Zekaryah (Meshelemyah’s son) was gatekeeper of the entrance to the assembly tent.
\v 22 \add Altogether, there were 212 men chosen to guard the gates\add*. \add The records of the clans in their villages listed their names\add*. \add King\add* David and \add the prophet\add* Shemuel \add (Samuel)\add* \add appointed them because they were dependable\add*.
\v 23 They and their sons \add watched\add* over the gates of Yahweh’s house, i.e., the \add sacred\add* tent, as guards.
\v 24 There were gatekeepers on each of the \add temple’s\add* four sides: east, west, north, and south.
\v 25 Their relatives in their villages would come in from time to time \add to relieve them\add* for seven days
\v 26 because the four leaders of the gatekeepers were Levites, and they were \add also\add* \add trusted to supervise\add* the chambers and the treasuries in God’s residence.
\v 27 They would \add spend the night\add* around the \add temple\add* while they were in charge, and \add would open it with the key each\add* morning.
\p
\v 28 Some of them \add monitored the utensils used in the activities\add*—counting them as they brought them out and \add when they put them away\add* \add again\add*.
\v 29 \add Others\add* took care of the containers and utensils used in the sanctuary, along with the fine flour, the wine and oil, and the frankincense and spices.
\v 30 Some of the priests mixed \add the fragrances and\add* spices.
\p
\v 31 There was a Levite \add named\add* Mattithiah (the oldest son of Shallum, who was a descendant of Korah) whose official duty \add was supervising the baking of the flat breads\add*.
\v 32 Some of Kohat’s descendants prepared the rows of bread to \add laid out on the sacred table\add* every rest day.
\p
\v 33 Some of Levi’s descendants were \add temple musicians and\add* singers. The leaders of those families stayed in the temple accommodations. They \add didn’t have other duties\add* because they \add were expected to\add* serve day and night.
\v 34 Those were the heads of the Levite \add families\add* according to their generations \add and\add* they lived in Yerushalem.
\s1 King Shaul’s ancestors and descendants
\r (1 Chr. 8:29-38)
\p
\v 35 \add Another descendant of Benyamin was\add* Yeiel. He was \add a founder\add* of Gibeon \add city\add* and lived there. His wife was Maakah.
\v 36 His oldest son was Avdon, and his other sons were Tsur, Kish, Baal, Ner, Nadav,
\v 37 Gedor, Ahyo, Zekaryah, and Miklot.
\v 38 Miklot was the father of Shimeam. They also lived \add near\add* their relatives in Yerushalem.
\p
\v 39 Ner was the father of Kish. Kish was the father of \add King\add* Shaul \add (Saul)\add*. Shaul was the father of Yonatan \add (Jonathan)\add*, Malki-Shua, Avinadav, and Esh-Baal.

\s1 The death of King Shaul and his sons
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (1 Sam. 31:1-13)
\p
\v 1 \add Now\add* the Philistines fought against Yisrael and the Israeli men fled \add away\add* from the Philistines, and \add many were killed\add* on Mt. Gilboa.
\v 2 Then the Philistines pursued after Shaul and after his sons, and \add they\add* \add killed\add* \add his\add* sons Yonatan, Avinadav, and Malki-Shua.
\v 3 The battle against Shaul was very fierce, \add but then\add* the archers spotted him and wounded him.
\v 4 Then Shaul said to his equipment carrier, “Draw your sword and pierce me with it, so those uncircumcised \add Philistines\add* \add can’t come here\add* and torture me.” But his equipment carrier was very scared and wasn’t willing to do it, so Shaul took \add his\add* sword and fell onto it.
\v 5 Then his equipment carrier, seeing that \add King\add* Shaul had died, he himself fell on \add his\add* sword and died.
\v 6 \add So\add* Shaul and his three sons died, \add thus ending his family’s rule\add*.
\v 7 \add When all the Israelis living\add* in the valley saw that \add the army\add* had fled, and that Shaul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled. Then the Philistines came, and they lived in them \add instead\add*.
\p
\v 8 The next day \add when\add* the Philistines came to strip the dead, they found \add the bodies of\add* Shaul and his sons on Mt. Gilboa.
\v 9 They stripped him and carried away his head and his armour. Then they sent \add messengers\add* all around the Philistine \add regions\add* to take the news to their idols and the people.
\v 10 They put his armour in the \add temple\add* of their gods, and they hung his head in \add their god\add* Dagon’s \add temple\add*.
\v 11 \add When\add* everyone who lived \add back\add* in Yavesh in the Gilead region heard about everything that the Philistines had done to Shaul,
\v 12 all the strong men \add took action\add* and \add retrieved\add* the corpses of Shaul and his sons, and brought them \add back\add* to Yavesh. Then they buried \add them\add* under the large tree in Yavesh, and they fasted seven days.
\v 13 \add So\add* Shaul died because of his \add disobedience\add*—when he was unfaithful to Yahweh \add by not following Yahweh’s instructions\add*, and also \add because he consulted medium\add* \add for guidance\add*\x + \xo 10:13: a \xt 1Sam 13:8-14; 15:1-24; \xo b \xt Lev 19:31; 20:6; 1Sam 28:7-8.\x*
\v 14 \add instead of requesting Yahweh’s advice\add*. \add So\add* \add Yahweh\add* killed him and handed the kingdom over to Yishay’s son David.
\c 11
\s1 David becomes king
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (2 Sam. 5:1-10)
\p
\v 1 Then all Yisrael assembled around David at Hevron, saying, “Look, we’re your flesh and bone \add relatives\add*.
\v 2 \add In the recent past\add*, even when Shaul was king, \em you\em* were the one who took Yisrael out and the one who brought us back in. Plus your god Yahweh told you, ‘You yourself will shepherd my people, Yisrael, and you yourself will become leader of my Israeli people.’ ”
\v 3 \add So\add* all the Israeli elders went to the king at Hevron, and David made a solemn agreement with them at Hevron \add in front\add* of Yahweh. Then they anointed David as king over Yisrael according to Yahweh’s message \add that was given through\add* \add the prophet\add* Shemuel \add (Samuel)\add*.
\p
\v 4 Then David and all Yisrael went to Yerushalem (\add Jerusalem, which was also known as\add* Yevus \add because the Yevusites were living there\add*).\x + \xo 11:4: \xt Josh 15:63; Jdg 1:21.\x*
\v 5 The inhabitants \add inside\add* Yevus said to David, “You won’t \add be entering this place\add*.” But David captured \add what became known as\add* the Tsiyyon \add (Zion)\add* stronghold, that is, the city of David.
\v 6 \add He\add* had said, “Whoever strikes down the Yevusites first will become \add my army commander\add*.” Tseruyah’s son Yoav went up \add over the wall\add* first, and he became head \add of the army\add*.
\v 7 David \add started\add* living in that stronghold, so then they called it the city of David.
\v 8 He built the city up all around, from the terrace \add to the surrounding walls\add*, and Yoav restored the rest of the city.
\v 9 \add So\add* David \add became more powerful because\add* army commander Yahweh \add helped\add* him.
\s1 David’s powerful warriors
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 10 The following were the leaders of David’s powerful warriors who together with all Yisrael, strengthened his kingdom and established him as king, \add just as\add* Yahweh had said.
\v 11 \add So\add* these are David’s powerful warriors: Yashaveam (a Hakmonite \add and\add* the leader of the thirty) once \add used\add* his spear against three hundred men in a single battle and killed them all.
\v 12 Next was Eleazar (an Ahohite, son of Dodo) who was one of the \add top\add* three powerful warriors.
\v 13 He was with David at Pas-Dammim \add when\add* the Philistines had assembled there for battle \add near\add* a part of the countryside \add where barley was growing\add*. \add At first, the Israelis\add* fled from the Philistines,
\v 14 \add but then\add* they took their stand in the middle of the \add barley\add* and \add proceeded to defeat\add* the Philistines \add as\add* Yahweh saved them through a stunning victory.
\p
\v 15 Then three of that top thirty went down to David, near the rock at Adullam’s cave. \add Meanwhile,\add* Philistines had encamped in the Refaim Valley.
\v 16 David was in that stronghold then, and the Philistine garrison was in Beyt-Lehem
\v 17 and David \add was thirsty and asked\add*, “Who’ll get me water to drink from the well by the Beyt-Lehem gate?”
\v 18 \add So those\add* three broke through the Philistine camp, and they drew water from the well at the Beyt-Lehem gate, and they brought it back to David. \add But\add* David wasn’t willing to drink it, and he poured it out \add on the ground as an offering\add* to Yahweh.
\v 19 “Far be it from me before my god \add to drink this water\add*,” he said. “Could I drink the blood of these men \add who risked\add* their lives to bring it?” \add So\add* he wasn’t \add prepared\add* to drink it. Those were \add some of the things\add* that those three powerful warriors did.
\p
\v 20 Yoav’s brother Abshai, was the head of a group of three. He had killed three hundred with is spear and had a reputation among the three.\f + \fr 11:20 \ft This seems unexpectedly similar to verse 11 and might possibly indicate some confusion in the early records.\f*
\v 21 He was honoured more than the other two and became the leader of that \add second\add* group of three, \add but\add* didn’t enter the \add first\add* Three.
\p
\v 22 Yehoyada’s son Benayah from Kavtse’el was a powerful warrior who did amazing things. He struck down Ariel’s two \add sons\add* from Moab. \add Another time,\add* he climbed down into a pit on a snowy day and killed the lion \add that was trapped\add* in the pit.
\v 23 He \add also\add* \add killed\add* a \add huge\add* Egyptian man—well over 2m tall. The Egyptian \add was carrying\add* a spear like a weaver’s beam, but \add Benayah\add* went down to \add take him on\add* with a staff. He forced the spear from the Egyptian’s \add grasp\add*, and then killed him with \add it\add*.
\v 24 \add So\add* that was what Benayah (Yehoyada’s son) did \add that gave him a reputation\add* among the three powerful warriors.
\v 25 \add Actually,\add* he was honoured more than the Thirty, \add yet\add* he didn’t \add make it to\add* the \add first\add* Three, \add but\add* David \add appointed\add* him over his bodyguards.
\p
\v 26 These are the names of the powerful warriors: Asahel (Yoav’s brother), Elhanan (Dodo’s son from Beyt-Lehem),
\v 27 Shammot (from Haror), Helets (from Pelon),
\v 28 Ira (Ikkesh’s son from Tekoa), Aviezer (from Anatot),
\v 29 Sibbekai (from Hushah), Ilai (from Ahoh),
\v 30 Maharai (from Netofah), Heled (Baanah’s son from Netofah),

\v 32 Hurai (from the valleys near Mt. Gaash), Aviel (from Aravah),
\v 33 Azmavet (from Baharum), Elyahba (from Shaalvon),
\v 34 Hashem’s sons (from Gizon), Yonatan (Shagee’s son from Harar),

\v 36 Hefer (from Mekerat), Ahiyyah (from Pelon),
\v 37 Hezro (from Karmel), Naarai (Ezbai’s son),
\v 38 Yoel (Natan’s brother), Mivhar (Hagri’s son),
\v 39 Tselek (the Ammonite), Naharai (from Beerot, armour bearer for Tseruyah’s son Yoav),
\v 40 Ira (the Yitrite), Garev (the Yitrite),
\v 41 Uryyah (Bat-Sheba’s husband the Hittite), Zavad (Ahlai’s son),
\v 42 Adina (Shiza’s son from the tribe of Reuven, a leader from that tribe who had thirty soldiers with him),
\v 43 Hanan (Maakah’s son), Yoshafat (from Mithna),
\v 44 Uzziyya (from Ashterat), Shama and Yeiel (Hotam’s sons from Aroer),
\v 45 Yediael (Shimri’s son) and his brother Yoha (from Tiz),
\v 46 Eliel (from Mahavah), Yerivai and Yoshaviah (Elnaam’s sons), Yitmah (from Moav),

\s1 The heroes accompanied to David
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 These were the men who joined David in Tsiklag, when he was \add banished\add* from Kish’s son, Shaul’s presence. (They were among the warriors who assisted \add David\add* in battle
\v 2 armed with bows. \add Some\add* \add used slings\add* right-handed and \add some\add* left-handed as well as \add shooting\add* arrows with a bow. \add They were\add* from \add the tribe of\add* Benyamin, Shaul’s relatives.)
\v 3 Their leader was Ahiezer, then next was Yoash, both Shemaah’s sons from Gibeah \add city\add*. \add Others were:\add* Yeziel and Pelet (Azmavet’s sons), Berakah, Yehu (from Anatot \add city\add*),
\v 4 Yishmayah (from Gibeon \add city\add*, who was the leader of the thirty greatest warriors), Yeremyah, Yahaziel, Yohanan, Yozabad (from Gederah \add city\add*),
\v 5 Eluzai, Yerimot, Bealyah, Shemaryah, Shefatyah (from Haruf \add city\add*),
\v 6 Elkanah, Yishshiyah, Azarel, Yoezer, and Yashoveam (all Korah’s descendants),
\v 7 and Yoelah and Zevadyah (Yeroham’s sons, from Gedor \add city\add*).
\p
\v 8 \add Some\add* Gadites \add joined\add* David at the wilderness stronghold. \add They were\add* very strong army warriors, ready for battle with shields and spears. \add Their faces were fierce like lions, but they could run across the hills like\add* gazelles.
\v 9 Their leader was Ezer, then Ovadyah, then Eliav.
\v 10 Next was Mishmannah, then Yermeyah,
\v 11 Attai, Eliel,
\v 12 Yohanan, Elzavad,
\v 13 \add another\add* Yermeyah, then the eleventh was Makbannai.
\p
\v 14 Those men from the \add tribe\add* of Gad were army leaders—\add each leading somewhere between\add* one hundred and one thousand \add men\add*.
\v 15 They crossed to the west side of the Yordan \add River\add* \add during the spring, at the time of the year when the river floods\add*. They \add drove out all the people who lived in the valleys on both sides\add* \add of the river\add*.
\p
\v 16 \add Some other men\add* \add from the tribes\add* of Benyamin and Yehudah also went to David in his stronghold.
\v 17 David went out \add of the cave\add* \add to meet them\add*, and he told them: “If you’ve come to me in peace, to help me, \add then I’ll be happy to agree with\add* you all. \add But\add* if \add you all plan\add* to betray me to my enemies \add even though I’ve done you all no harm\add*, may the god of our ancestors see \add your motives\add* and judge.”
\p
\v 18 Then \add the\add* spirit \add empowered\add* Amasai, the head of the thirty, \add and he said\add*: “To you, David, and with you, son of Yishay \add (Jesse)\add*. Peace, peace to you and peace to the one who helps you, because your god has helped you.” And David received them and placed them as the heads of the troop.
\p
\v 19 \add Some men\add* from Menashsheh \add joined\add* David when he \add accompanied\add* the Philistines to battle against \add King\add* Shaul. (\add But\add* \add David and his men\add* didn’t help \add the Philistines\add* because the Philistines’ governors \add were advised\add* to send them away \add as there was a worry that David would feel loyal to his former master, and hence turn on them\add*.)
\v 20 As \add David\add* was going to Tsiklag, \add the following men from Menashsheh joined\add* him: Adnah, Yozavad, Yediael, Mikael, \add another\add* Yozavad, Elihu, and Tsilletai—the \add captains\add* of \add units of\add* thousands from Menashsheh.
\v 21 They helped David \add stand\add* against \add bands of raiders\add*, because all of them \add were powerful warriors and military leaders\add*.
\v 22 \add Every day more men joined\add* to help David, until his army became very large \add like the Israeli people themselves\add*.
\p
\v 23 \add The following are\add* the numbers of the leaders of those equipped for war. They came to David at Hevron to \add help him obtain Shaul’s kingdom as Yahweh had promised\add*.
\li1
\v 24 From Yehudah \add (Judah)\add*: 6,800 \add warriors\add* ready for battle with shields and spears.
\li1
\v 25 From Shimeon \add (Simeon)\add*: 7,100 powerful \add warriors\add* ready for battle.
\li1
\v 26 From Levi: 4,600.
\li1
\v 27 Yehoyada (a leader \add descended\add* from Aharon) brought 3,700 with him.
\li1
\v 28 Tsadok, a strong young man \add brought\add* twenty-two leaders \add from his clan\add*.
\li1
\v 29 From Benyamin (Shaul’s tribe): 3,000 (\add most of whom had previously served\add* \add King\add* Shaul).
\li1
\v 30 From Efrayim: 20,800 \add powerful warriors who were admired within their own clans\add*
\li1
\v 31 From the half-tribe of Menashsheh: 18,000 who were \add known by name\add* came to make David king.
\li1
\v 32 From Yissakar: 200 leaders (\add with a good understanding of the times and the right thing to do\add*) along with their relatives that they commanded.
\li1
\v 33 From Zevulun: 50,000 \add experienced warriors with each kind of weapon\add* and \add stoic in attitude yet loyal\add*.
\li1
\v 34 From Naftali: 1,000 officers, along with 37,000 \add men\add* carrying shields and spears.
\li1
\v 35 From Dan: 28,600 \add men\add* prepared for battle.
\li1
\v 36 From Asher: 40,000 \add warriors\add* prepared for battle.
\li1
\v 37 From Reuven, Gad, and the Menashsheh half-tribe across the Yordan \add river\add*: 120,000 \add men\add* armed with all kinds of weapons.
\p
\v 38 All those \add enthusiastic and capable warriors\add* came to Hevron to make David king over all Yisrael. The rest of Yisrael was also \add united in wanting\add* to make David king.
\v 39 They were there with David three days, eating and drinking, \add because their families had sent provisions with them\add*.
\v 40 Also, those \add who lived near that area\add* (\add even\add* as far as Yissakar and Zevulun and Naftali) were bringing bread on donkeys and camels, and on mules and on oxen: plentiful supplies of flour, fig cakes, raisin cakes, wine, and oil, as well as oxen and sheep, because Yisrael \add was celebrating\add*.

\r (2 Sam. 6:1-11)
\p
\v 1 \add One day\add* David consulted with all his leaders—the commanders of thousands and of hundreds.
\v 2 David said to all the assembly of Yisrael, “If it \add sounds\add* good to you all, and to our god Yahweh, let’s spread out to \add all our different regions to recruit\add* our relatives, along with the priests and the Levites in the cities of their pasturelands, \add so they can join\add* us.
\v 3 And let’s return our god’s box \add back here\add*, because we didn’t \add use it to ask God for guidance in Shaul’s time\add*.”
\v 4 All the assembled people agreed because everyone \add could see that it was the right thing to do\add*.
\p
\v 5 \add So\add* David assembled all Yisrael from Shihor \add river down\add* in Egypt and as far \add north\add* as Lebo-Hamat, to bring in God’s chest from Kiriat-Yearim.\x + \xo 13:5: \xt 1Sam 7:1-2.\x*
\v 6 Then David and all Yisrael went to Kiriat-Yearim (\add also known as\add* Baalah, in Yehudah), to bring up from there the box of God Yahweh who sits over the winged creatures. \add The box is used when\add* \add calling his name\add* \add to request help\add*.\x + \xo 13:6: \xt Exo 25:22.\x*
\v 7 They transported God’s box on a new cart from Avinadav’s house, and Uzzah and Ahyo were leading the cart
\v 8 and David and all Yisrael were celebrating \add in front\add* of God with all \add their energy\add*, and with songs, and with lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.
\p
\v 9 \add However\add* \add just as they were passing\add* Kidon’s threshing floor, the oxen stumbled and Uzzah \add reached out to steady\add* the box.
\v 10 \add That made\add* Yahweh \add very angry with\add* Uzzah, and he struck him down because he \add had reached out to touch\add* the box, and he died \add right\add* there \add in front\add* of God.
\v 11 \add That in turn made\add* David angry because Yahweh \add had burst out\add* against Uzzah, and he named that place Perets-Uzzah \add (which means ‘outburst against Uzzah’)\add* until this day.
\p
\v 12 David \add was afraid of\add* God that day \add and asked himself\add*, “How can I possible bring God’s box to where I am \add in Yerushalem\add*?”
\v 13 \add So\add* David \add gave up on bringing the box to where he was\add* in the city of David, and \add instead\add* he took it into the \add nearby\add* house of Oved-Edom the Gittite.
\v 14 \add So\add* God’s box stayed at Oved-Edom’s house for three months, and Yahweh blessed Oved-Edom’s home and everything that belonged to him.\x + \xo 13:14: \xt 1Ch 26:4-5.\x*

\v 3 Then David took more wives in Yerushalem and \add he\add* fathered more sons and daughters.
\v 4 These \add are his children\add* who were born \add there\add* in Yerushalem: Shammua, Shovav, Natan, Shelomoh \add (Solomon)\add*,

\p
\v 8 \add When\add* the Philistines heard that David had been anointed as king over all Yisrael, the entire Philistine \add army\add* went up \add into the hill country\add* to \add eliminate\add* \add him\add*. David \add got this news and took his army out to meet them\add*.
\v 9 \add Meanwhile,\add* the Philistines went and raided the Refaim valley,
\v 10 and David asked God, “Should I \add take on\add* the Philistines, and will you give \add me victory over them\add*?”
\p “Go \add ahead\add*,” Yahweh \add answered\add*, “and I’ll \add enable you to defeat them\add*.”
\p
\v 11 Then they\f + \fr 14:11 \ft It’s not clear who’s being referred to here.\f* went up to \add what’s now called\add* Baal-Peratsim, and David \add defeated\add* them down there. David said, “God has \add used me to\add* break through my enemies like \add a flooded river breaking a dam\add*.” Therefore they named that place Baal-Peratsim \add (which means ‘the master bursts through’)\add*.
\v 12 \add The Philistines\add* abandoned their \add idols\add* \add as they fled\add*, and David ordered them to be burnt.
\p
\v 13 \add But\add* \add soon\add* the Philistines raided the valley again,
\v 14 and David asked God\add ’s advice\add* again. “Don’t go uphill after them,” God said, “\add but\add* circle around them and confront them in front of the balsam trees.
\v 15 When you hear the sound of the marching in the tops of the balsam trees, \add that’s when you should attack\add*, because God will have gone out \add ahead of you\add* to strike down the Philistine army.”
\v 16 \add So\add* David did just as God had told him, and he \add attacked\add* the Philistines from Giveon \add all the way to\add* Gezer.
\v 17 \add So David’s reputation spread everywhere\add*, and Yahweh \add caused the other nations to be afraid of\add* him.

\v 1 \add David\add* constructed houses for his \add wives\add* in the city of David. He \add also\add* prepared a place for God’s \add sacred\add* box and erected a tent for it.

\v 3 David assembled all Yisrael in Yerushalem to bring Yahweh’s box uphill there to the place that he’d prepared for it.
\v 4 Then he summoned Aharon’s descendants and these Levites:
\li1
\v 5 From Kohat’s descendants \add (Levi’s second son)\add*: Uriel the leader and 120 of his relatives.
\li1
\v 6 From Merari’s descendants \add (Levi’s third son)\add*: Asayah the leader and 220 of his relatives.

\v 9 From Hevron’s descendants: Eliel the leader and eighty of his relatives.
\li1
\v 10 From Uzziyel’s descendants: Amminadav the leader and 112 of his relatives.
\p
\v 11 David summoned the priests Tsadok and Abiatar and these Levites: Uriel, Asayah, Yoel, Shemayah, Eliel, and Amminadav.
\v 12 He told them, “You are the heads of the Levite clans. Consecrate yourselves, you and your relatives, and bring the box of Yisrael’s god Yahweh up to where I’ve prepared \add a place\add* for it.
\v 13 The first \add time we tried,\add* it wasn’t you \add Levites, so\add* our god Yahweh burst out against us because we \add hadn’t requested his instruction\add*.”
\p
\v 14 \add So\add* the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves to bring up the \add sacred\add* box of Yisrael’s god, Yahweh.
\v 15 Then, \add following Yahweh’s instructed as given to Mosheh\add* \add (Moses)\add*, Levi’s descendants carried God’s \add sacred\add* chest with it’s poles on their shoulders.\x + \xo 15:15: \xt Exo 25:14.\x*

\v 16 \add Meanwhile,\add* David instructed the Levite leaders to assign their brothers as the singers with instruments of song, harps, lyres, and cymbals—playing to raise a sound of \add celebration\add*.
\v 17 The Levites assigned Yoel’s son Heman and his relative Asaf (son of Berekyah) and Eytan (Kishayah’s son, a descendant of Merari),
\v 18 along with their \add Levite\add* cousins: Zekaryah, Ben, Yaaziel, Shemiramot, Yehiel, Unni, Eliav, Benayah, Maaseyah, Mattityah, Elifelehu, Mikneyah, and two of the temple gatekeepers, Oved-Edom and Yeiel.
\v 19 Heman, Asaf, and Etan \add sang and also played\add* bronze cymbals.
\v 20 Zekaryah, Aziel, Shemiramot, Yehiel, Unni, Eliav, Maaseyah, and Benayah \add played harps in a certain musical style\add*.
\v 21 Mattityah, Elifelehu, Mikneyah, Oved-Edom, Yeiel, and Azazyah \add played lyres in a different musical style\add*.

\v 22 Kenanyah, the leader of the musical Levites, \add directed the singing because he was very capable\add*.
\v 23 Berekyah and Elkanah \add were two of\add* \add the men who guarded\add* the \add sacred\add* chest.
\v 24 The priests Shevanyah, Yoshafat, Netanel, Amasai, Zekaryah, Benayah, and Eliezer were the ones who blew trumpets in front of God’s \add sacred\add* chest. Oved-Edom and Yehiyyah \add also\add* guarded the \add sacred\add* chest.

\v 26 \add Indeed,\add* God helped the Levites carrying the box \add containing\add* Yahweh’s agreement, and they slaughtered seven bulls and seven rams.

\p
\v 1 \add After a while when\add* David was living in his house, \add he\add* said to the prophet Natan, “Look, \add here\add* I am living in a \add palace\add* \add made\add* of cedar, \add but\add* the box \add containing\add* Yahweh’s agreement is \add kept\add* \add in a tent\add*.”
\v 2 “\add Go add and do what you’re planning\add*,” Natan \add replied\add*, “because God is with you.”
\p
\v 3 \add But that night God spoke\add* to Natan,
\v 4 “Go and tell my servant David that Yahweh says this: You yourself \add won’t be the one to\add* build a residence for me to live in,
\v 5 because I haven’t lived in a building from the day that I brought Yisrael \add out of Egypt\add* until today—I’ve \add moved from place to place and tent to tent\add*.
\v 6 \add As I travelled with all the Israelis\add*, \add did I ever complain to any of Yisrael’s leaders\add* who I’d commanded to shepherd my people, \add and ask them\add*, ‘Why haven’t you all built a house of cedar for me?’ ”
\p
\v 7 “\add So now you should tell\add* my servant David that army commander Yahweh says this: I myself took you from the pasture, from behind the sheep, to be a leader over my people Yisrael.
\v 8 I’ve always been with you wherever you’ve gone, and I’ve \add defeated all your enemies who were attacking you\add*, and I’ll \add make you famous like some of the greatest people in the world\add*.
\v 9 I’ll set a place for my people Yisrael, and I’ll plant them, and they’ll settle \add in that place\add* and \add not need to be fearful again\add*. \add Violent groups won’t continue to trouble them like they’ve done before\add*,
\v 10 and \add ever since the time that I put heroes and leaders\add* over my people Yisrael. Then I’ll humble all your enemies. \add In addition\add*, I declare to you that Yahweh will build \add a dynasty\add* for you.
\v 11 \add When your time on earth is up and it’s time to join your deceased ancestors\add*, then I’ll raise up one of your sons and establish his kingdom.
\v 12 He’ll \add be the one to\add* build a temple for me and establish a \add dynasty that will last\add* forever.
\v 13 I myself will be a father to him, and he’ll be a son to me, and I won’t \add cease my loyal commitment to him like I ended it with your predecessor\add*.\x + \xo 17:13: \xt 2Cor 6:18; Heb 1:5.\x*
\v 14 I’ll \add confirm his rule over my temple and my kingdom forever, and his ruling dynasty will last\add* forever.”

\v 17 This was such a small thing in your eyes, God, and you’ve spoken about \add the future of your servant’s family\add*, and you’ve \add blessed me more than I deserve\add*, Yahweh God.
\v 18 What more can I, David say to you \add about how\add* you’ve honoured your servant, because you \add certainly know me well\add*.
\v 19 Yahweh, you’ve done all these great \add things\add* for the sake of your servant, and \add done just what you wanted in order to reveal your greatness\add*.
\v 20 Yahweh, there’s no one else like you, and no god except you, \add as we’ve all heard for ourselves\add*.
\v 21 \add There’s no other country\add* like your people Yisrael—the only nation in the world where \add you\add* God, rescued the people in order to make them your own. That made you famous and also feared, as you drove the people groups out ahead of your people who you ransomed out of Egypt.
\v 22 You took your people Yisrael to be your people forever, and you, Yahweh, became our god.
\p
\v 23 “And now, Yahweh, may \add what you said\add* about your servant and his \add family\add* be confirmed forever, and \add come to pass\add* just like you’ve said.
\v 24 May your reputation be established and increase forever, as \add people\add* say, ‘Army commander Yahweh, Yisrael’s god, is god over Yisrael.’ And your servant David’s family has been established \add as you’ve watched\add*

\v 2 Then he \add attacked and defeated\add* Moav, and the Moabites became servants to David—\add taking him\add* \add regular\add* tribute.
\p
\v 3 Next David \add attacked and defeated\add* King Hadadezer of Tsovah-Hamat, when \add that king had tried enforce his control\add* at the Euphrates \add River\add*.
\v 4 David captured 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot-soldiers from him. And David hamstrung all but one hundred of the chariot \add horses\add*.

\v 5 When the Arameans \add (or, Syrians)\add* came from Damascus to help King Hadadezer, David struck killed 22,000 of the Arameans.

\v 7 David took the gold shields that were used by Hadadezer’s servants and brought them to Yerushalem.
\v 8 \add He\add* also took a lot of bronze from Hadadezer’s cities of Tibhat and Kun. (\add Later,\add* Shelomoh/Solomon used it to make the \add huge bronze basin called ‘the sea’, along with its\add* pillars and other bronze items.)\x + \xo 18:8: \xt 1Ki 7:40-47; 2Ch 4:11-18.\x*

\v 1 \add Some time later\add*, the Ammonite King Nahash died and his son \add Hanun\add* \add became their king\add*

\v 3 the Ammonite leaders \add asked their new king\add*, “\add Do you think that\add* David’s \add really\add* sending comforters to honour your father? \add Wouldn’t it be more likely that he sent his servants to explore and spy out the land in order to overthrow you\add*?”
\v 4 \add So\add* \add King\add* Hanun took David’s servants, and \add had their beards\add* shaved off, plus he cut \add off the bottom half of their robes to expose their\add* buttocks, and then he sent them \add home\add*.
\v 5 \add Some people quickly informed David what had happened\add*, so he sent \add messengers\add* to meet the men (because they were very much humiliated) and to tell them, “Stay \add there\add* in Yeriho \add (Jericho)\add* until your beards grow \add out\add*, then return \add here\add*.”
\p
\v 6 \add By then\add*, the Ammonites \add realised that they had greatly insulted\add* \add King\add* David, \add so\add* \add King\add* Hanun and the Ammonites sent thirty tonnes of silver to hire chariots and horsemen from Aram-Naharayim, Aram-Maakah, and Tsovah.
\v 7 They hired 32,000 chariots, \add as well as\add* the king of Maakah and his army. They \add all\add* came and \add set up their camps near\add* Meydeva, \add plus they were joined by\add* the Ammonites \add themselves\add* coming out of their cities ready for battle.
\p
\v 8 \add When\add* David heard \add about that\add*, he sent Yoav \add with the entire\add* army.
\v 9 Then the Ammonites marched out and deployed ready for battle at the entrance to their city, while kings who had come were over in the countryside \add with their men\add*.
\p
\v 10 Yoav \add quickly\add* realised that \add he’d have to fight on two fronts, so\add* he chose Yisrael’s best warriors and set them out to face the Arameans \add (Syrians)\add*,
\v 11 while he placed the remaining men (under the control of his \add older brother\add* Avshai) out against the Ammonites.
\v 12 Yoav told them, “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you \add can come to rescue me\add*. \add But\add* if the Ammonites \add start to gain on you\add*, then I’ll \add come to\add* rescue you.
\v 13 We must be strong and fight hard to defend our people and our cities \add that belong to\add* our god. Yahweh will do \add what he considers to be\add* good.”

\v 16 \add When the Arameans\add* saw that they were defeated \add by\add* Yisrael, they sent messengers to bring \add more Arameans from across the Euphrates river, led by\add* Shofak, the commander of Hadadezer’s army.
\v 17 \add When\add* that was reported to David, he gathered all Yisrael and crossed the Yordan. They positioned themselves against the Arameans who then fought against them.
\v 18 \add But the Arameans fled away from the Israelis\add*, and David killed seven thousand chariot \add drivers\add* and forty thousand men on foot, as well as killing Shofak their army commander.
\v 19 When Hadadezer’s servants saw that \add Yisrael had defeated them\add*, they made peace with David and \add became his subjects, so\add* Aram \add (Syria)\add* wasn’t willing to help the Ammonites \add militarily\add* any more.

\s1 David captures Rabbah
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (2 Sam. 12:26-31)
\p
\v 1 \add Then in the spring when kings often march out to war\add*, Yoav led the army out for war and he devastated the land of the Ammonites. Then he reached \add the capital,\add* Rabbah, and he besieged it while David stayed in Yerushalem. Yoav \add defeated\add* Rabbah and \add demolished the city\add*.\x + \xo 20:1: \xt 2Sam 11:1.\x*
\v 2 Then David took their king’s crown off his head—it was gold with a valuable gemstone set in out, and \add weighed thirty kilograms\add*. He put \add the crown\add* on his own head, plus he took a very large amount of plunder out of the city.
\v 3 Then they took all the people out of the city and \add forced them to work\add* with saws and iron picks, and axes. David did that for the people of all the Ammonite cities, then he returned to Yerushalem with his army.

\v 4 \add Some time later,\add* war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer, then Sibbekai the Hushatite struck down Sippai, from the descendants of the Refaim, and they were subdued.
\p
\v 5 Then there was another battle with the Philistines, and Yair’s son Elhanan \add killed\add* Lahmi the brother of Goliyat \add (Goliath)\add*\x + \xo 20:5: \xt 1Sam 17:4-7.\x* the Gittite \add (i.e., from Gat)\add*, even though his spear shaft was \add as thick\add* as the beam of a weaver’s \add loom\add*.
\v 6 There was also war at Gat where there was a \add very tall man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot who was also a descendant\add* of Rafa.
\v 7 \add When\add* he insulted Yisrael, Shimea’s son Yonatan killed him. (Shimea was one of David’s \add older\add* brothers.)
\p
\v 8 Those were the descendants of Rafa from Gat who were killed by David and he men.

\s1 David orders a census
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (2 Sam. 24:1-25)
\s2 Yoav doesn’t want to do the census
\p
\v 1 Then a trouble-maker went against Yisrael \add by\add* encouraging David \add to take a census of\add* Yisrael,
\v 2 \add So\add* David \add ordered\add* Yoav and \add the other officials\add*, “Go \add and\add* count Yisrael from Be’er-Sheva \add in the south\add* and as far \add north\add* as Dan, \add then come and tell me so that I’ll know how many warriors I have\add*.”
\p
\v 3 “My master, the king, may Yahweh \add multiply his people one hundred times over\add*. Aren’t they all \add your\add* servants?” Yoav \add diplomatically\add* \add queried\add*, “\add So\add* why does my master \add want to do\add* this? Why should \add he bring judgement on\add* Yisrael?”
\v 4 \add But the king insisted, so Yoav was forced to go and survey the entire country\add*. Then he returned to Yerushalem
\v 5 and \add reported the numbers\add* to David. Yisrael had 1.1 million sword-wielding men, and Yehudah had 470 thousand.
\v 6 \add However,\add* \add Yoav\add* had \add intentionally\add* not counted \add the tribes of\add* Levi and Benyamin, because \add he\add* was horrified by the king’s command.
\s2 Punishment for the census
\p
\v 7 God \add was displeased by what David had ordered, and he punished\add* Yisrael,
\v 8 and David said to God, “I’ve \add disobeyed you badly by doing that\add*. Please \add forgive your servant for his disobedience\add*, because I’ve \add been very stupid\add*.”
\p
\v 9 Then Yahweh told David’s prophet Gad,
\v 10 “Go and tell David that Yahweh says this: \add I’ll give you three options—choose one of them and that’s what I’ll\add* do to you.”
\p
\v 11 \add So\add* Gad went to David and told his, “Yahweh says that you must choose \add one of these punishments\add*:
\v 12 either three years of famine, or three months of being overcome by your enemies’ \add armies\add*, or three days of Yahweh’s ‘sword’ of pestilence in the land and the Yahweh’s messenger \add bringing destruction\add* across all of Yisrael’s territory. \add So now, tell me what answer I should take\add* back to the one who sent me?”
\p
\v 13 “\add Oh,\add* that’s very distressing,” David \add replied\add* to Gad, “but please don’t let me fall into the hands of \add my enemies\add*. Yahweh \add is very merciful, so please let him be the one to punish me directly\add*.”
\p
\v 14 \add So\add* Yahweh \add sent a disease\add* throughout Yisrael and seventy thousand Israeli men \add died\add*.
\v 15 Then God sent a messenger to destroy Yerushalem, and \add while the disease was still spreading\add* Yahweh \add looked down\add* and relented about the tragedy, and he told to the destroying messenger, “Enough! Now release your hand.” Now Yahweh’s messenger \add happened to be\add* standing at the threshing floor of Ornan the Yevusite.
\p
\v 16 \add As\add* David \add looked up\add*, he saw Yahweh’s messenger standing between the earth and the heavens, holding his sword stretched out over Yerushalem. Then David and the elders who were \add all\add* dressed in sackcloth, fell \add to their knees and bowed their faces to the ground\add*.
\v 17 Then David \add asked\add* God, “Wasn’t it me myself who said to count the people? It’s me who \add disobeyed and clearly did what was wrong\add*, but these sheep, what have they done? Yahweh my god, please \add direct your punishment\add* against me and \add my extended family\add*, but \add don’t continue this\add* plague on your people.”
\p
\v 18 Then Yahweh’s messenger told Gad to tell David that \add he\add* should \add build\add* an altar to Yahweh at the threshing floor of Ornan the Yevusite.
\v 19 \add So\add* David went up \add to that place when he heard\add* \add Gad’s message that was delivered\add* in Yahweh’s name.
\v 20 \add Meanwhile,\add* Ornan was threshing wheat, and he turned and saw \add Yahweh’s\add* messenger and he and his four sons who were with him \add quickly\add* hid \add behind something\add*.
\v 21 \add When David arrived there,\add* Ornan saw him and left the threshing floor and \add knelt\add* in front of David and bowed his face to the ground.
\v 22 Then David \add asked\add* Ornan, “Give me this place with its threshing floor, and I’ll build an altar to Yahweh on it. \add Sell it to me\add* at the full price, so the plague against the people will be stopped.”
\p
\v 23 “My master the king, take \add anything that you want\add*,” Ornan \add replied\add*. “Listen, I’ll donate the cattle for the burnt offerings and the threshing sledges for firewood, and the wheat for the offering—all \add at no charge\add*.”
\p
\v 24 “No, I’ll most definitely pay the full price,” King David \add responded\add*. “I couldn’t offer a burnt offering to Yahweh \add if it hadn’t cost me anything\add*.”
\v 25 \add So\add* David paid Ornan six hundred gold pieces for \add his\add* place,
\v 26 and he built an altar to Yahweh there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on it. He called to Yahweh, and \add Yahweh\add* answered him with fire from the heavens on that altar of the burnt offering.
\p
\v 27 Then Yahweh spoke to \add his\add* messenger who then returned his sword to his sheath.
\s1 The location for the future temple
\s4 Full kingdom
\v 28 When David saw that Yahweh had answered him at (the Yevusite) Ornan’s threshing floor, then he sacrificed there.
\v 29 \add At that time\add*, Yahweh’s \add sacred\add* tent that Mosheh \add (Moses)\add* had made in the wilderness, and the altar for burnt sacrifices, were \add on a hill used for worship near\add* Gibeon \add city\add*.
\v 30 David wasn’t able to go there to \add ask God’s direction\add* because he was terrified of Yahweh’s messenger’s sword.
\c 22
\p
\v 1 Then David said, “This is \add now\add* the residence of Yahweh God, and this is the altar for Yisrael’s burnt \add offering\add*.”
\s1 The preparation of standing up of temple
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 2 Then David said to gather the foreigners who \add lived\add* in Israel, and he assigned \add them the job of\add* hewing out cut stones to build the residence for God.
\v 3 He prepared a large quantity of iron for the door \add hinges and fittings\add*, so much brass that it couldn’t be weighed,
\v 4 and innumerable cedar logs that the Tsidonians and the Tsorians \add (Sidonians and Tyrians)\add* brought in for David.
\v 5 David said, “My son Shelomoh \add (Solomon)\add* is young and tender, and the house to be built for Yahweh must be \add impressive for the sake of his reputation\add* and for beauty in all the lands \add so\add* I’ll prepare for it now.” \add So\add* David prepared a large amount before \add he died\add*.
\p
\v 6 Then David called for his son Shelomoh \add (Solomon)\add*, and ordered him to build a residence for Yisrael’s god Yahweh.
\v 7 David told \add him\add*, “My son, I wanted to build a temple to honour my god Yahweh,\x + \xo 22:7-10: \xt 2Sam 7:1-16; 1Ch 17:1-14.\x*
\v 8 \add but\add* Yahweh \add gave me this message\add*, ‘You’ve fought a lot of battles and shed a large amount of blood, \add so\add* you won’t be the one who’ll build a residence \add to honour me\add*—you’ve shed too much blood on the ground \add in my sight\add*.’
\v 9 \add He told me,\add* ‘Listen, you’ll have a son who’ll be a man of peace. I’ll give him relief from all his enemies from the surrounding regions. That’s why he’ll be called ‘Shelomoh’ \add (which sounds like ‘Shalom’—the Hebrew word for peace)\add*, and I’ll give peace and quietness to Yisrael during his lifetime.
\v 10 He’ll be the one to build a residence for me, and he himself will become my son, and I’ll become his father, and I’ll establish the throne of his kingdom over Yisrael forever.’
\p
\v 11 “Now, my son, may Yahweh be with you, and may you be successful and build a residence for Yahweh your god, just as he said you would.
\v 12 \add I also ask\add* Yahweh to give you insight and understanding, and give you charge over Yisrael so that you can keep your god Yahweh’s regulations.
\v 13 Then you’ll succeed, if you are careful to follow the instructions and the directions that Yahweh commanded Mosheh \add (Moses)\add* concerning Yisrael. Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or discouraged.\x + \xo 22:13: \xt Josh 1:6-9.\x*
\p
\v 14 Now, see, \add despite many battles\add*, I’ve prepared the following for Yahweh’s residence: three thousand tonnes of gold and thirty thousand tonnes of silver, along with too much bronze and iron to weigh, and timber and \add cut\add* stones. Plus you’ll be able to add more.
\v 15 \add You’ll have plenty of skilled workers including those who work with stone and those who work with wood\add*.
\v 16 \add Then there’s so many skilled with gold and silver, and bronze and iron. So get organised and get started\add*, and may Yahweh be with you.
\p
\v 17 Then David ordered all the Israeli officials to assist his son Shelomoh, \add saying\add*,
\v 18 “Isn’t Yahweh your god with you all, and hasn’t he given peace to you all from all around, because he’s \add allowed me to take control of this region, and this area has been subdued with the help\add* of Yahweh and his people.
\v 19 Now, \add dedicate your mind and strength to request advice from your god Yahweh, then get organised and build the sanctuary of Yahweh God so you can bring the box containing Yahweh’s agreement to the residence to be built to honour Yahweh’s name, and bring God’s sacred items\add*.”
\c 23
\p
\v 1 \add By then David was old and coming to the end of his life\add*, and he made his son Shelomoh \add (Solomon)\add* king over Yisrael.\x + \xo 23:1: \xt 1Ki 1:1-40.\x*
\s1 The Levite families and their assignments
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 2 Then \add David\add* gathered all the Israeli officials and the priests and Levites.
\v 3 Counting the Levite males that were thirty years old and older, they found there were thirty-eight thousand men.
\v 4 \add David assigned\add* twenty-four thousand of them to supervise the work at Yahweh’s temple, six thousand to be officials and judges,
\v 5 four thousand to be gatekeepers, and four thousand to praise Yahweh using the musical instruments that he’d provided.
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* David divided \add the Levites\add* into divisions according to \add their ancestry through\add* Levi’s sons Gershon, Kohat, and Merari.
\s1 The Gershonites
\p
\v 7 The Gershonites \add included\add* Ladan and Shimei.
\v 8 Ladan’s three sons were: Yehiel (the oldest), Zetam, and Yoel.
\v 9 Shimei’s\f + \fr 23:9 \ft Possibly the wrong name got into the Hebrew here, because it disagrees with v10.\f* three sons were: Shelomot, Haziel, and Haran. (They were leaders of Ladan’s clans.)
\v 10 Shimei’s four sons were: Yahat, Zina,\f + \fr 23:10 \ft Some ancient translations have Zizah here, which would seem to fit better with v11.\f* Yeush, and Beriah.
\v 11 (Yahat was the head, and Zizah was second. Yeush and Beriah were \add grouped together as one family unit as they only had few descendants\add*.)
\s2 The Kohatites
\p
\v 12 Kohat’s four sons were: Amram, Yitshar, Hevron, and Uzziel.
\v 13 Amram’s sons were Aharon and Mosheh \add (Aaron and Moses)\add*. Aharon \add and his future male descendants were permanently appointed\add* to consecrate the most sacred things, to burn incense, to minister to Yahweh, and to bless his name.\x + \xo 23:13: \xt Exo 28:1.\x*
\v 14 Mosheh \add was known as\add* \add a man who served\add* God, and his descendants were included with the \add other\add* Levites.
\v 15 Mosheh’s sons were Gershom and Eliezer.
\v 16 Gershom’s eldest son was Shevuel.
\v 17 Eliezer’s only son was Rehavyah, but Rehavyah \add went on to\add* have many sons.
\p
\v 18 Yitshar’s eldest son was Shelomot.
\v 19 Hevron’s sons \add from oldest to youngest\add* were: Yeriyyah, Amaryah, Yahaziel, and Yekamean.
\v 20 Uzziel’s sons were Mikah and Yishshiyah.
\s2 The Merarites
\p
\v 21 Merari’s sibs were Mahli and Mushi, \add and\add* Mahli sons were Eleazar and Kish.
\v 22 Eleazar died without having any sons, \add so\add* his brother Kish’s sons married his daughters \add (to continue the family name)\add*.
\v 23 Mushi had three sons: Mahli, Eder, and Yerimot.
\p
\v 24 Those were Levi’s descendants \add by their clans and their appointments, who did the work of serving in Yahweh’s temple once they reached twenty years old\add*,
\v 25 because David had said, “Yisrael’s god Yahweh has given peace to his people, and he’ll \add now\add* live forever in Yerushalem,
\v 26 so the Levites won’t need to carry the \add sacred\add* tent anymore, along with all its equipment.”\x + \xo 23:26: \xt Deu 10:8.\x*
\v 27 \add So one of David’s final instructions had been to count the Levite men who were twenty years old and over\add*,
\v 28 because their work was to \add assist\add* Aharon’s descendants in their work in Yahweh’s temple. They \add were in charge\add* of the temple courtyards and siderooms, \add in charge of the purification ceremonies\add*, and did other work at the temple.\x + \xo 23:28-32: \xt Num 3:5-9.\x*
\v 29 \add They were also in charge of\add* the sacred bread, as well as the fine flour for the offering, the wafers of bread without rising agent, the baking pans, and \add all the measuring and mixing of ingredients\add*.
\p
\v 30 Every morning and every evening \add the Levites\add* stood and praised Yahweh.
\v 31 They would also do that on the rest days, and at the new moon celebrations and during the other religious festivals. \add There were regulations about how many of them must always be on duty serving\add* Yahweh.
\v 32 They were \add also\add* in charge of the sacred tent and the holy place and assisting \add the priests\add* (their relatives, Aharon’s descendants) in their service at Yahweh’s temple.
\c 24
\s1 The Levites’ duties
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 Aharon’s sons were: Nadav, Avihu, Eleazar, and Itamar,
\v 2 \add but\add* Nadav and Avihu died \add before their father\add* and \add without having any children, so\add* \add only\add* Eleazar and Itamar became priests.\x + \xo 24:2: \xt Lev 10:1-2.\x*
\v 3 David \add gave Eleazar’s descendant Tsadok, and Itamar’s descendant Ahimelek two different sets of duties to perform\add*.
\v 4 \add There were more leaders among Eleazar’s descendants than there were among Itamar’s descendants, so they appointed sixteen leaders from Eleazar’s descendants and eight from Itamar’s descendants\add*.
\v 5 They divided up \add the duties by lots so some of the leaders from each of the two groups served the facility and others served God directly\add*. DOUBLE-CHECK, along with v3.
\v 6 Netanel’s son Shemayah was the Levite scribe who recorded all this in front of the king and the leaders, Tsadok the priest and Abiatar’s son Ahimelek, and the clan leaders of the priests and the Levites. (One family was drawn by lot from Eleazar’s group, and then the next from Itamar’s, etc.)
\p
\v 7 The first two \add allocations of duties\add* went to Yehoyariv and then Yedayah.
\v 8 Next were Harim and Seorim,
\v 9 Malkiyyah and Miyyamin,
\v 10 Hakkots and Aviyyah,
\v 11 Yeshua and Shekanyah,
\v 12 Elyashiv and Yakim,
\v 13 Huppah and Yesheveav,
\v 14 Bilgah and Immer,
\v 15 Hezer and Ha-Pitstsets,
\v 16 Patahyah and Yehezkel,
\v 17 Yakin and Gamul,
\v 18 Delayah and lastly, Maazyah.
\p
\v 19 Those \add were the priests\add* selected to \add be leaders of the groups\add* that would serve in Yahweh’s temple, following the instructions that Yisrael’s god Yahweh had given their ancestor Aharon.
\s2 Other Levites
\p
\v 20 This is a list of some of Levi’s other descendants:
\li1 From Amram’s sons: Shuvael.
\li1 From Shuvael’s sons: Yehdeyah.
\li1
\v 21 From Rehavyah’s sons: Yishshiyah, the leader.

\li1
\v 29 Kish’s son: Yerahme’el.
\li1
\v 30 Mushi’s sons: Mahli, Eder, and Yerimot.
\p Those were the Levites listed by their ancestors’ families.
\v 31 They too, used lots just like Aharon’s descendants (their relatives) \add to determine their specific duties\add* irrespective of where they came in their families. This was done in front of King David, Tsadok and Ahimelek, the clan leaders, and the \add other\add* priests and Levites.

\s1 The temple singers
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 Then David and the army chiefs allocated the \add musical\add* service to the sons of Asaf, Heyman, and Yedutun—the ones prophesying with harps, with lyres, and with cymbals. \add This is a list of the men whom they chose for that work\add*:
\li1
\v 2 From Asaf’s sons: Zakkur, Yosef, Netanyah, and Asarelah. They were supervised by Asaf, who prophesied \add under the king’s direction\add*.
\li1

\li1
\v 4 From Heman’s sons: Bukkiyah, Mattanyah, Uzziel, Shuvael, Yerimot, Hananyah, Hanani, Eliatah, Giddalti, Romamti-Ezer, Yoshbekashah, Malloti, Hotir, and Mahaziot.
\v 5 They were all sons of King David’s prophet Heman \add who’d been promised by God that he’d strengthen him\add*, and God gave him fourteen sons and three daughters.
\p
\v 6 All of those served as musicians in Yahweh’s temple under their fathers’ supervision—they played cymbals, harps, and lyres. \add Their fathers were supervised by\add* the king.
\v 7 There were 288 of those men and their musical relatives who played to Yahweh.
\v 8 They used lots to determine their duties, whether young or old, and \add irrespective of their musical abilities\add*.
\p
\v 9 The first allocation went (in order) to:
\li1 Asaf and his son Yosef,
\li1 Gedalyah and his relatives and sons (a total of twelve),

\li1
\v 6 Oved-Edom’s son Shemayah also had sons. (They were leaders in their father’s family because they were capable warriors.)
\v 7 Shemayah’s sons were: Otni, Refael, Oved, and Elzavad. His relatives Elihu and Semakyah were also capable men.
\p
\v 8 All those descendants of Oved-Edom and their sons and relatives were capable people and strong workers. Altogether there were 62 of them.
\li1
\v 9 Meshelemyah had sons and relatives who were respected (eighteen in total).
\li1
\v 10 Merari’s descendant Hosah’s sons: Shimri (not actually the firstborn, but his father appointed him as the first),
\v 11 Hilkiyah, Tavalyah, and Zekaryah. (Thirteen total sons and relatives.)
\p
\v 12 Those men were leaders of the groups of men who guarded the gates of the temple. They worked in Yahweh’s temple like their relatives did.
\v 13 \add They used lots to assign each family to a particular gate, irrespective of the family reputation\add*.
\v 14 Shelemyah’s group was allocated to the eastern gate, and his son Zekaryah (a wise adviser) was allocated to the northern gate.
\v 15 Oved-Edom’s group was allocated to the southern gate, plus his sons \add were to guard\add* the storehouses.
\v 16 Shuppim’s and Hosah’s groups were allocated the western gate, along with the Shalleket gate on the uphill road with \add side-by-side guards\add*.

\v 2 Then King David stood up and spoke, “Listen to me, my brothers and my people, I had in my heart to put up a building for the box containing Yahweh’s covenant to rest in. It’s the footstool of our god’s feet of our god and I’ve made preparations to start building,\x + \xo 28:2-7: \xt 2Sam 7:1-16; 1Ch 17:1-14.\x*

\p
\v 4 “Yet Yisrael’s god Yahweh chose me from all of my father’s family to be king over Yisrael forever, because he chose a leader from \add the tribe of\add* Yehudah, my father’ tribe, and among the sons of my father, with me he was pleased to make king over all Israel.
\v 5 Then out of the many sons that he’s given me, he chose my son Shelomoh \add (Solomon)\add* to \add be the next king to rule his kingdom of\add* Yisrael.
\p
\v 6 “Then he told me, ‘Your son Shelomoh is the one who will build my temple and the courtyards \add around it\add*, because I’ve chosen him to be like my son and I’ll be like a father to him.
\v 7 I’ll establish his kingdom forever, if he’s diligent at following my instructions and \add obeying\add* my judgements, like he is at present.’

\v 8 “\add So\add* now, in \add front\add* of all Yisrael, Yahweh’s assembly, and in the ears of our god, \add I challenge you all to discover and obey\add* all the commands of your god Yahweh so that you’ll all possess the good land and you’ll all leave your sons after you to inherit it forever.

\v 10 You can now see that you need to be strong and get busy, because Yahweh has chosen you to erect a building to be his sanctuary.”
