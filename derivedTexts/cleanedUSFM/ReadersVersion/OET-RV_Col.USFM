\mt2 Paul’s letter to the believers in
\mt1 Colossae
\is1 Introduction
\ip This letter of Paul was written to the believers in Colossae, a town in Asia Minor (also called Anatolia, now part of modern Turkey) that’s almost 500km overland east of Ephesus. Paul had not yet visited Colossae, but he was very concerned for them and he had sent helpers from Ephesus.
\ip Paul had heard that there were false teachers influencing the believers there in Colossae. They taught that if a person wants to be saved and wants to deepen their faith in God, it’s not sufficient to have faith in the messiah because they said that it’s necessary to obey other restrictions and customs as well as worshipping angels.
\ip So Paul wrote to the believers there in Colossae and explained the truth concerning Yeshua the messiah. He told them that it’s Yeshua who made everything around us, therefore he’s greater than the angels and other unseen powers. He also saw the godliness of his father, and there’s no other source of life for believers other than him. So then it’s necessary that the believers don’t follow human customs and traditions, but rather, it’s necessary that they simply follow the messiah.
\ip It should be noted here that this letter, like most of the scriptures, was dictated to a scribe (See 2 Thess 3:17), so it was an oral letter, quite different from our modern letters which we edit with word-processing software, adding a word back in a previous sentence, combining two short sentences, or breaking an over-long sentence. Oral letters tend to contain a lot of \it run-on sentences\it* where the thoughts keep flowing without a break, thus 1:3-8 and 1:9-16 are considered by most Greek experts to be long sentences (like this one is 😀), however for us as readers, sentences with around a hundred words in them are very difficult for us to absorb, hence this \em Reader’s Version\em* breaks those long Greek sentences into a number of smaller sentences, in fact, this kind of adjustment is regularly done throughout the Bible by all major English translations in order to make them easier for us to read, but the disadvantage is that we can sometimes lose whatever the connection was between the consecutive thoughts. The \em OET\em* tries to be more transparent about such adjustments by placing the \em Literal Version\em* right beside this text so that the serious student can compare the two.

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul, a missionary of \nd Messiah Yeshua\nd* by God’s will, and \add from\add* our brother Timothy.
\p
\v 2 To the people \add there\add* in Colossae who’re godly and faithful brothers and sisters in Messiah.
\p Grace and peace to you all from \nd God\nd* our father and \add the\add* \nd master Yeshua\nd* Messiah.
\s1 Paul’s thanks and prayers
\p
\v 3 We thank \nd God\nd*, \add the\add* father of our \nd master Yeshua Messiah\nd* as we continually pray for you all,
\v 4 after having heard about your faith in \nd Messiah Yeshua\nd* and the love that you have for all godly people
\v 5 which arose because of your hope in a heavenly reward. You all previously heard about that in the message of the truth—the good message
\v 6 that’s in you and that is bearing fruit in the world and growing, just like it did among all of you from the day that you heard \add it\add* and knew about the grace of \nd God\nd* in truth.
\v 7 \x + \xo 1:7: \xt Col 4:12; Phm 23.\x*You all learnt that from Epaphras, our dearly loved fellow slave and who is our faithful servant of the \nd messiah\nd*,
\v 8 and he is the one who made your love in the \nd spirit\nd* evident to us.
\p
\v 9 It’s because of that that we haven’t stopped praying from the time that we heard it, and requesting that you all would be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual insight,
\v 10 to live worthily of the \nd master\nd*—pleasing him in every \add kind of\add* good and productive work. \add We pray that you all\add* will grow in the knowledge of \nd God\nd*
\v 11 and be strengthened with all power, according to his great power, \add leading to\add* endurance and patience with contentment.
\v 12 Then you’ll all be thanking the father, the one who qualified you all for a part of the inheritance of godly people \add who live\add* in the light.
\v 13 The father rescued us from the power of darkness and redirected us into the kingdom of his dear son—
\v 14 \x + \xo 1:14: \xt Eph 1:7.\x*the one who buys us out of slavery and forgives our sins.
\s1 Yeshua is both the first and the highest
\p
\v 15 The son is the \add visible\add* image of the invisible \nd God\nd*, the firstborn of all creation
\v 16 because it was him who created everything in the heavens and on the earth, both visible and invisible, including all authorities such as kingdoms and governments. \add Yes,\add* everything was created by him and for him.
\v 17 He came before everything and everything \add still\add* only exists because of him.
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18: \xt Eph 1:22-23.\x*He is the head of the body which is the assembly. He is the beginning, the first of the dead to come back to life, so that he would be the first in everything,
\v 19 because \add God\add* was pleased to live in him in all totality
\v 20 \x + \xo 1:20: \xt Eph 2:16.\x*and to reconcile everything to himself through him—both things on earth and things in the heavens. \add God\add* made peace through him by means of the blood at the \add execution\add* stake.
\p
\v 21 Once all of you were alienated \add from God\add*—your thinking was that of an enemy and your actions were evil,
\v 22 but now you all have been reconciled by means of the death of \add Yeshua’s\add* physical body. He’s able to present you as pure and blameless in front of \add God\add*—unable to be charged for any infraction
\v 23 if indeed you continue on in your established and firm faith. Don’t let \add anyone\add* drive away the hope that \add comes from\add* the good message that you all heard and which has been proclaimed throughout the whole world—it’s that good message that I’ve become a servant of.
\s1 Paul’s work for believers
\p
\v 24 So now I’m happy to be suffering for you all, and I’m catching up in my body to the tribulations of the \nd messiah\nd* in his body, which is the assembly.
\v 25 I became a servant of the assembly under God’s supervision when he gave me the \add work\add* of fulfilling God’s message—
\v 26 the mystery which had been hidden away from the generations over the ages, but which was recently revealed to his chosen people.
\v 27 God wanted them to explain the riches of the this incredible mystery among the pagans: the \nd messiah\nd* in you all bringing the hope of reaching God.
\v 28 \add Yes,\add* Messiah who we are telling everyone about as we teach and recommend to everyone, so they we might present every person \add made\add* perfect in Messiah.
\v 29 That’s what I’m working hard towards according to his work as well—working in me with power.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 I want you all to know how much I struggle for you and for those in Laodicea and for those who’ve never actually set eyes on me.
\v 2 \add By knowing that,\add* their hearts may be comforted, having been held together in love and to all the riches of the full assurance of the insight, to the knowledge of the mystery of \nd God\nd*, \nd Messiah\nd*. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
\v 3 \add He holds\add* all the treasures of wisdom and secret knowledge.
\p
\v 4 I’m telling you all this so that none of you will be deceived by persuasive talk,
\v 5 because even though I’m physically far way, I’m with you all in the spirit. I’m pleased to see the sensibleness and firmness of your faith in \nd Messiah\nd*.
\s1 Living in Messiah
\p
\v 6 So in the same way that you all received the \nd messiah\nd*, \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd master\nd*, keeping living in him.
\v 7 You’ve already been rooted in him and then built-up and confirmed in the faith just as all of you were taught, and being very thankful.
\p
\v 8 Be careful in case anyone captures \add your minds\add* with fancy ideas or theories without proof that come from human traditions or from worldly thinking, and not from \nd Messiah\nd*.
\v 9 Every component of the greatness of God lives in his \add human\add* body,
\v 10 and you also have been completed and are in him. He is the head of all rule and authority.
\p
\v 11 It wasn’t just human hands that circumcised you by \add cutting off part of the body\add*, but \nd Messiah\nd* circumcised you all by cutting you away from your sinful acts.
\v 12 \x + \xo 2:12: \xt Rom 6:4.\x*You all were buried with him when you were immersed \add in water\add*, and you came back to life with him when you came up \add from the water\add*, through faith in God’s working which gave him life after death.
\v 13 \x + \xo 2:13: \xt Eph 2:1-5.\x*You all were dead in your disobedience and because your bodies were ‘uncircumcised’. Then he made us alive together with him after he forgave us for all our disobedience.
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14: \xt Eph 2:15.\x*He erased the writing that listed the charges against us and so it was removed—nailed to the stake.
\v 15 He had disarmed the rulers and authorities and publicly exposed them, because he had won the victory over them \add on the stake\add*.\f + \fr 2:15 \ft The meaning of the Greek ‘ἐν αὐτῷ’ literally ‘in it/him’ isn’t clear here and leads to two common translations: a/ ‘on/in him’, or as we have chosen (interpreting the ‘it’ to be referring back to ‘σταυρῷ’ ‘execution stake’ from the previous verse), ‘on the stake’.\f*
\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 2:16: \xt Rom 14:1-6.\x*Don’t let anyone judge you all about what you eat or drink, or about \add observing\add* feasts or holidays or days of rest.
\v 17 They’re just shadows of what’s coming, but the body \add causing the shadow\add* is that of the \nd messiah\nd*.
\v 18 Don’t let anyone be disqualifying you all with their \add apparent\add* humility and worshipping the messengers, telling you what they’ve seen and being arrogant and vain about their earthly minds.
\v 19 \x + \xo 2:19: \xt Eph 4:16.\x*They’re not listening to the head which controls all the joints and ligaments of the body and holds it all together as \nd God\nd* causes it to grow.
\s1 From death to life with the messiah
\p
\v 20 If you’ve died to worldly principles, then why are you letting yourselves be indoctrinated with worldly living:
\v 21 ‘Don’t hold this. Don’t taste that. Don’t touch this.’
\v 22 \add No,\add* All those \add rules\add* lead to corruption when they’re used as the commands and teaching of humans.
\v 23 They seem to be wise and make you more religious or humble as you strictly obey them, \add but\add* don’t honour \add the realities\add* of our worldly desires.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 3:1: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*So if you all were brought back to life along with the messiah, then be concerned with discovering the things from above where the messiah is sitting on God’s right.
\v 2 \add Yes,\add* be thinking about things from above, not earthly things
\v 3 because you’ve all ‘died’ and your lives have been hidden in \nd God\nd* with the \nd messiah\nd*.
\v 4 When he is revealed \add on his return\add*, then your lives will also be revealed with him in GLORY.
\s1 The old and new lives
\p
\v 5 So put your earthly natures to death: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desires, and greediness which is idolatry,
\v 6 because those things invoke God’s severe anger.
\v 7 You all used to do those things when you lived in them.
\p
\v 8 But now, don’t let any of these things come out of your mouth: severe anger, rage, malice, slander, or profanity.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9: \xt Eph 4:22.\x*Don’t lie to each other, because you’ve gotten rid of the ‘old person’ and their habits.
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10: a \xt Eph 4:24; \xo b \xt Gen 1:26.\x*So ‘dress’ in the ‘new person’ who’s renewed with the knowledge of being in the image of the creator,
\v 11 where there’s no distinctions between ethnicities or religion, locals and foreigners, slaves or free, but \nd Messiah\nd* is everything and in all \add of us\add*.
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 3:12-13: \xt Eph 4:2.\x*So as holy people chosen and loved by \nd God\nd*, ‘dress’ in: compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, gentleness, patience,
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Eph 4:32.\x*tolerating each other, and forgiving anyone who has a complaint about another person. The \nd master\nd* forgave all of you, so you also should forgive \add others\add*.
\v 14 Then over all of those, ‘dress’ in love which is the perfect connection \add to others\add*.
\v 15 Let the peace of the \nd messiah\nd* rule in your hearts. That’s what you were called to \add as parts of\add* one body. Make sure that you’re thankful
\v 16 \x + \xo 3:16-17: \xt Eph 5:19-20.\x*and that the \nd messiah’s\nd* message is a rich part of you with all its wisdom as you teach and give advice to each other. Sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs to \nd God\nd* with thankfulness in your hearts.
\v 17 Then give thanks to \nd God\nd* the father through the name of Messiah \nd Yeshua\nd* in everything—whatever you’re all saying or doing.
\s1 Advice by role
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 3:18: \xt Eph 5:22; 1Pe 3:1.\x*You wives should be subject to your husbands to the degree that it’s fitting in \nd Yahweh\nd*.
\p
\v 19 \x + \xo 3:19: \xt Eph 5:25; 1Pe 3:7.\x*You husbands should love your wives—don’t become bitter towards them.
\p
\v 20 \x + \xo 3:20: \xt Eph 6:1.\x*You children should obey your parents in everything, because that pleases \nd Yahweh\nd*.
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 3:21: \xt Eph 6:4.\x*You fathers shouldn’t be exasperating your children otherwise they may become discouraged.
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22-25: \xt Eph 6:5-8.\x*You slaves should submit to your human masters in everything, not just when they’re watching like others do, but sincerely, and so honouring the \nd master\nd*.
\p
\v 23 Whatever you all might be doing, consider in your hearts that you’re working for the \nd master\nd* and not for people,
\v 24 knowing that \nd Yahweh\nd* will repay you with an inheritance because you’ve been serving the \nd master messiah\nd*.
\v 25 \x + \xo 3:25: \xt Deu 10:17; Eph 6:9.\x*Anyone who’s doing wrong will be repaid for that wrongness, and there won’t be any favouritism.
\c 4
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 4:1: \xt Eph 6:9.\x*\nd You\nd* masters, ensure that you’re treating your slaves with goodness and equality, knowing that you all also have a master \add of your own\add* in heaven.
\s1 Further teaching for believers
\p
\v 2 Persevere in prayer, keeping watch and being thankful.
\v 3 Pray together for us as well that \nd God\nd* would open a door for us \add to share\add* the message—to tell \add about\add* the mystery of the \nd messiah\nd*. That’s also why I’m in chains—
\v 4 so that I can explain the mystery whenever I have an opportunity to speak.
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 4:5: \xt Eph 5:16.\x*Use wisdom as you all walk towards non-believers, using the time wisely.
\v 6 Always show grace in your conversations, like a meal that’s seasoned with salt, so you’ll know how to answer each person in their situation.
\s1 Final greetings
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 4:7: \xt Acts 20:4; 2Tim 4:12.\x*My dear brother and faithful servant and fellow slave, Tychicus, will tell you all about me.
\v 8 I’m sending him to all of you \add there\add* so you’ll find out the \add news\add* that concerns you all and so that he can comfort you \add there\add*.
\v 9 \x + \xo 4:9: \xt Phm 10-12.\x*The faithful and dear brother, Onesimus, who’s from your place will also be with him.
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 4:10: a \xt Acts 19:29; 27:2; Phm 24; \xo b \xt Acts 12:12,25; 13:13; 15:37-39.\x*My fellow prisoner, Aristarchus, sends his greetings along with Barnabas’ cousin, Mark. You’ve already received instructions about that, so accept him if he arrives \add there\add*.
\v 11 Yeshua who’s nicknamed Yustus also sends his greetings. These guys are from strict Jewish backgrounds, but they’re \add my\add* only fellow-workers for God’s kingdom who became an encouragement to me.
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12: \xt Col 1:7; Phm 23.\x*Epaphras sends his greetings. He’s \add another\add* one from your place and a slave of \nd messiah Yeshua\nd* who always prays for you that you will stand mature and fully confident in all of God’s will.
\v 13 I can assure you that he has strong concerns for you all, as well as those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis.
\v 14 \x + \xo 4:14: a \xt 2Tim 4:11; Phm 24; \xo b \xt 2Tim 4:10; Phm 24.\x*The dear doctor Luke greets you all, as does Dermas.
\p
\v 15 Give my greetings to the brothers and sisters in Laodicea, and to Nympha and the assembly \add that meets\add* in her house,
\v 16 and whenever my letter gets read to you all, make sure that it’s also read to those from the assembly in Laodicea, and that you all \add also\add* read their letter.
\v 17 \x + \xo 4:17: \xt Phm 2.\x*Tell Archippus to make sure to fulfil the duties that \nd Yahweh\nd* gave him to do.
\p
\v 18 \sig I, Paul, am writing this \+add final\+add* greeting in my own handwriting. Remember me \+add here\+add* in chains.\sig*
\p \sig May \+add God’s\+add* grace be with all of you.\sig*
