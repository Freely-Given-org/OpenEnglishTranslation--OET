\is1 Introduction
\is2 The author
\ip Paul
\is2 The recipient
\ip Titos, often spelt (wrongly) as ‘Titus’ in English translations, wasn’t a Jew and didn’t originally believe in God. However, in later times he became a believer and from there, he became a helper in Paul’s work. This letter was sent by Paul there to Titos in Crete where he had been left to look after a group of believers. (Crete is an island that was a part of Greece.)
\is2 This letter
\ip There are three main things contained in this letter: Firstly Titos is reminded about what is appropriate behaviour for teachers of believers. It was important that he understand this because those from Crete had many undesirable customs and there were many teachers of false doctrines that would confuse believers.
\ip Secondly Titos was advised Titos how to teach the various groups of believers there, including young men and slaves, along with older men and women. (Then those older women were to teach the younger women.)
\ip Finally Paul advised Titos about how believers should live, including avoiding attacking others, arguing, and splitting the believers into opposing groups. Paul reminded Titos again to follow the teachings of Yeshua the messiah and obey what he commanded us.
\ip Paul wanted it to be known that it’s very important for believers to behave well (1:6; 2:7,14; 3:1,8-9,14) even though doing good things can’t earn their salvation (3:5).

\v 1 \add This letter is from\add* Paul, a slave of God and a missionary of \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah\nd* and follower of the faith of the ones that God has chosen.
\p I share the knowledge of the truth which leads to godliness
\v 2 and the expectation of living forever which God promised before time began. And God can’t lie
\v 3 but revealed his message in his own time, and I’ve been entrusted to proclaim this by the command of \nd God\nd* our saviour.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 1:4: \xt 2Cor 8:23; Gal 2:3; 2Tim 4:10.\x*To Titos, my true son due to our common faith. May \nd God\nd* the father and our saviour \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah\nd* give you grace and peace.
\s1 Qualifications for leaders
\p
\v 5 The reason that I asked you to stay behind in Crete was so that you would find what needed to be reorganised and so that you would appoint elders in every city just as I had directed you.
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6-9: \xt 1Tim 3:2-7.\x*Each elder must have a clean record, be the husband of one wife, and have believing children who are not wild or disobedient.
\v 7 Any overseer \add in the assembly\add* as a manager working for \nd God\nd* must have a clean record, not be self-centred, not be quick to get angry, not addicted to wine, not a bully, and not greedy,
\v 8 but rather hospitable, someone who loves what is good, sensible, honest, loves God, and self-controlled.
\v 9 He must hold faithfully to the message that was taught, so that he will be effective in encouraging others with sound teaching and to be rebuking those who speak against the message.
\s1 Handling those who go off the track
\p
\v 10 There’s plenty of people who don’t want to be told what to do, empty talkers and outright deceivers, especially those that push the letter of the law.
\v 11 These people need to be silenced because they mess up whole families when they teach them things that they shouldn’t—all for the sake of shameful game.
\v 12 One of their own prophets said that the people from Crete are liars, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons,
\v 13 and that’s right. For those reasons, you need to sternly tell them they’re wrong, so that they can become sound in their faith,
\v 14 and not pay attention to Jewish myths or human rules which turn people away from the truth.
\v 15 For someone who’s pure in their thinking, everything is pure to them, but for unbelievers and those who’ve strayed from the truth, nothing is pure because their minds and consciences have already been damaged—
\v 16 they say that they know \nd God\nd*, but their actions show that they don’t, and so they’re detestable. They can no longer accept teaching so they’re unsuitable for any good work.
\c 2
\s1 Proper behaviour for believers
\p
\v 1 But you, \add Titos,\add* only \add teach what’s consistent with sound doctrine\add*.
\v 2 Older men should be sober, dignified, sensible, and sound in their faith, their love, and their endurance.
\v 3 Likewise older women should honour God by their behaviour, not making false accusations, not addicted to a lot of wine. They should teach what is good
\v 4 so that they can train the younger women to love their husbands and children,
\v 5 and to be sensible and pure, homemakers that do good for others, living under the authority of their husbands so that others don’t speak evil of God’s message because of them.
\p
\v 6 Also encourage younger men to be sensible.
\v 7 Be a good example in everything you do and in your teaching. Don’t be led astray, maintain your dignity,
\v 8 watch every word that comes out of your lips, stay above reproach—all this so that those who oppose us can be reached because there’s nothing bad they can say about us.
\p
\v 9 Slaves need to conform to their master’s commands, aiming to please. They shouldn’t speak against their masters
\v 10 or be pilfering from them, rather they should display their good faith so that their actions add to the teachings of \nd God\nd* our saviour.
\p
\v 11 This is because God’s grace which offers salvation to all people has appeared
\v 12 and teaches us that when we distance ourselves from ungodliness and worldly lusts, we can live sensibly and justly and devoutly in the present age.
\v 13 Then we can look forward to the blessing of the \add majestic appearance\add* of our great \nd God\nd* and saviour, \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah\nd*
\v 14 \x + \xo 2:14: a \xt Psa 130:8; \xo b \xt Exo 19:5; Deu 4:20; 7:6; 14:2; 1Pe 2:9.\x*who gave himself for us in order to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify us into his chosen people, eager to do good things.
\p
\v 15 Teach these things as you encourage some and scold others, but don’t let anyone disrespect you.
\c 3
\s1 Expected behaviour
\p
\v 1 Remind people to conform to their rulers and authorities, being obedient and ready to do anything that’s good.
\v 2 Don’t slander others, be peaceable. Don’t be strong-willed, but rather show gentleness to all people.
\v 3 We were also foolish and stubborn at one time, straying from the good and giving in to various lusts and pleasures, being mean and envious, even full of hate and hating one another.
\v 4 But when \nd God\nd* our saviour revealed his kindness and love for humankind,
\v 5 he saved us, not because of the ‘good deeds’ that we did, but out of his mercy. He regenerated us through washing and renewed us by \add his\add* holy \nd spirit\nd*
\v 6 which he lavishly poured on us through \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah\nd*
\v 7 so that we might become heirs with the expectation of living forever, having been declared that we have no outstanding legal charges thanks to his grace.
\v 8 That statement can be trusted. I want you to confirm those things so that those who have believed in \nd God\nd* will be leading in wanting to do good things. These things are good and benefit everyone.
\p
\v 9 But avoid foolish debates, arguments about ancestry, other strife, and quarrels about \add God’s\add* commands because they all achieve nothing and waste time.
\v 10 Refuse to listen to a divisive person after you’ve given them two warnings
\v 11 knowing that such people condemn themselves by their corruption and sinful attitude.
\s1 Closing
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 3:12: \xt Acts 20:4; Eph 6:21-22; Col 4:7-8; 2Tim 4:12.\x*Whenever I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, you should try to meet me at Nicopolis, because I’ve decided to spend the winter there.
\v 13 \x + \xo 3:13: \xt Acts 18:24; 1Cor 16:12.\x*Help by sending Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way so that they won’t be needing anything.
\v 14 Our people must also be learning to be leading in doing good things to meet the necessary needs so that they won’t be unproductive.
\p
\v 15 Everyone here with me sends their greetings to you. And please greet the ones there for us who love us in the faith.
\p May \add God’s\add* grace be with all of you.
