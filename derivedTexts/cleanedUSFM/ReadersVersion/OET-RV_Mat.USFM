\mt2 The account of Yeshua’s ministry by
\mt1 Matthew
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip The writer of this document was Matthaios, known in English as Matthew and in Hebrew as Levi. He was one of the twelve apprentices of Yeshua, and named by Alfaeus his father. He was from Galilee but worked in Capernaum as a tax-collector before he left that to follow Yeshua. It’s possible that it was Yeshua who changed his name from Levi when he became a follower, and named him Matthew which means ‘the gift of God’ in Hebrew.
\is2 This account
\ip Matthew’s account starts by listing the ancestors of Yeshua, and then describes his birth, his immersion in water, and his temptation by the devil. He tells us about a lot of his preaching and teaching, and about how he healed many sick people in the Galilee region. After that, Matthew goes on to describe Yeshua’s trip to Yerushalem and what happened to him there. Then he explains what happened in Yeshua’s final week in Yerushalem, his execution on a stake, and his coming back to life.
\ip This document tells how Yeshua is the messiah, promised by God to save the Jews, and all non-Jews who place their trust in him. So by means of him, God fulfills his promises to his people that were listed in the Old Testament.
\ip This good message reveals Yeshua as the great teacher to explain God’s law. Here in this document, Matthew records five lengthy teaching sessions about God’s kingdom: (1) The preaching on the hill about people’s behaviour, their responsibilities, and what they might expect to receive in God’s kingdom (chapters 5–7); (2) warning the twelve apprentices about their works (chapter 10); (3) the parables about God’s kingdom (chapter 13); (4) the teaching concerning the way to become a follower (chapter 18); and (5) the teaching concerning the end of this age and God’s kingdom which is coming. (chapters 24–25).

\v 11 \x + \xo 1:11: \xt 2Ki 24:14-15; 2Ch 36:10; Jer 27:20.\x*Josiah was the father of Jechoniah (Grk: Yechonias) and his brothers, when they were deported to Babylon (Grk: Babulonos).
\p
\v 12 And after the deportation to Babylon, Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel (Grk: Salathiel), Shealtiel was the father of Zerubbabel (Grk: Zorobabel),

\p
\v 17 So the generations from Abraham to David numbered fourteen, from David to the deportation to Babylon there were fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the \nd messiah\nd* there were fourteen generations.
\s1 The birth of the messiah
\r (Luke 1:26-38; 2:1-7)
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 1:18: \xt Luk 1:27.\x*Now this is how the birth of \nd Yeshua\nd* came about: Maria his mother was engaged to Yosef. But before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through \add the work of\add* the holy \nd spirit\nd*.
\v 19 But Yosef, her husband \add to be\add* was a good man, and not wishing to disgrace Maria, he decided to quietly divorce her.
\v 20 But as he was pondering this, one of Yahweh’s messengers appeared to him in a dream and told him, “Yosef, descendant of \add King\add* David, don’t to be afraid to marry Maria because the baby in her has been conceived by the holy \nd spirit\nd*.
\v 21 \x + \xo 1:21: \xt Luk 1:31.\x*In due course she will have a son and you’ll name him \nd Yeshua\nd*, because he will save his people from their sins.”
\p
\v 22 Now all this happened in fulfilment of what Yahweh had said through the prophet,
\v 23 \x + \xo 1:23: \xt Isa 7:14 (LXX).\x*“Listen, the virgin will get pregnant and she will have a son, and they will call him Immanuel \add (in Hebrew)\add* which means ‘\nd God\nd* with us.’ ”
\p
\v 24 Then Yosef got up and did what Yahweh’s messenger had commanded him and he went ahead and married Maria
\v 25 \x + \xo 1:25: \xt Luk 2:21.\x*but he didn’t sleep with her until after she gave birth. And Yosef named the boy \nd Yeshua\nd*.

\s1 Easterners come to worship the new king
\p
\v 1 After \nd Yeshua\nd* had been born in Bethlehem in the province of Yudea during the time of King Herod, watchers of signs arrived in Yerushalem from the east
\v 2 and asked, “Where is the one born as king of the Jews, because we saw his star in the east and we came to worship him.”
\p
\v 3 Now when King Herod heard this, he was upset and all of Yerushalem as well.
\v 4 He gathered together all of the chief priests and those who teach the religious law to the people and asked them where the \nd Messiah\nd* was expected to be born.
\p
\v 5 And they told him, “It’ll be in Bethlehem in Yudea because the prophet wrote:\x + \xo 2:5-6: \xt Mic 5:2.\x*
\q1
\v 6 ‘You Bethlehem in the land of Yudah,
\q2 are not the most insignificant of the leaders of Yudah.
\q1 For a leader will come from you
\q2 who will guide my people Yisrael.’ ”
\p
\v 7 Then Herod sent for the watchers of signs and met secretly with them to determine when the star had first appeared.
\v 8 Then he sent them on to Bethlehem with these instructions: “Go on and carefully investigate about the child and when you find him, report back to me so that I can also come and worship him.”
\p
\v 9 So when the king had finished speaking, they departed and the star which they could see in the east went ahead of them and stopped above the place where the child was.
\v 10 Seeing this, the watchers of signs were very happy indeed.
\v 11 As they entered the house, they saw the child with his mother Maria. They bowed low and worshipped him, then they opened their chests and presented gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
\p
\v 12 But because they had been warned in a dream not to return to King Herod, they went home again to their own country.
\s1 The family escape to Egypt
\p
\v 13 After they had departed, one of \nd Yahweh’s\nd* messengers appeared to Yosef in a dream and said, “Get up and take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt \add (Mitsrayim)\add*. Remain there until I tell you, because \add King\add* Herod will soon search for the child in order to kill him.”
\p
\v 14 So Yosef got up during the night and took the child and his mother and departed for Egypt.
\v 15 \x + \xo 2:15: \xt Hos 11:1.\x*They stayed there until the death of Herod, in order to fulfil what \nd Yahweh\nd* had said through the prophet \add Hoshea\add*: “I called my son out of Egypt.”
\s1 The slaughter of baby boys
\p
\v 16 When \add King\add* Herod realised that he had been tricked by the watchers of signs, he got very angry and gave orders that all the sons in Bethlehem and its districts that were two years old and younger be killed, because that was the period that he had found out from the watchers of signs.
\p
\v 17 That fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah which said:
\q1
\v 18 \x + \xo 2:18: \xt Jer 31:15.\x*The sound of great weeping and mourning was heard in Ramah;
\s1 Yosef’s family return to Nazareth
\p
\q1 Rachel weeping for her children and she didn’t want to be comforted
\q2 because her children were no more.
\p
\v 19 After \add King\add* Herod died, one of \nd Yahweh’s\nd* messengers appeared to Yosef in Egypt in a dream
\v 20 and said, “Get up and take the child and his mother and go \add back\add* to the land of Yisrael, because the ones wanting to kill him have died.”
\v 21 So Yosef got up and took the child and his mother and went \add back\add* to Yisrael.
\p
\v 22 But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Yudea instead of his father Herod, and \add also\add* having been warning in a dream, he left \add Yudea\add* and went to the Galilee area.
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Mrk 1:24; Luk 2:39; Yhn 1:45.\x*Once they got there, he settled into the town of \nd Nazareth\nd*, so that what had been spoken through the prophets would be fulfilled: “He will be called a Nazarene.”
\c 3
\s1 Yohan-the-immerser’s preaching
\r (Mark 1:1-8; Luke 3:1-18; Yhn 1:19-28)
\p
\v 1 That was the time when Yohan-the-immerser started preaching in the Yudean wilderness
\v 2 telling everyone,\x + \xo 3:2: \xt Mat 4:17; Mrk 1:15.\x* “Turn from your sins because the kingdom of heavens is close.
\v 3 This is the man that the prophet Isayah was talking about \add when he wrote\add*:\x + \xo 3:3: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*
\q1 ‘The voice of one shouting in the wilderness
\q2 prepare the road for \nd Yahweh\nd*;
\q2 straighten his paths.’
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 3:4: \xt 2Ki 1:8.\x*Yohan himself wore clothes made from \add coarse\add* camel hair with a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
\v 5 \add People from\add* Yerushalem and all Yudea and all of the regions surrounding the Yordan River went out \add into the wilderness\add* to \add listen to\add* Yohan
\v 6 and many confessed their sins and asked him to immerse them in the river.
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 3:7: \xt Mat 12:34; 23:33.\x*But when Yohan saw many from the party of the Pharisees and from the Sadducee sect coming for immersion, he told them, “You brood of snakes, who warned you all to flee from \add God’s\add* severe anger that’s coming?
\v 8 Turning from your sins should be accompanied by evidence that you’ve changed.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9: \xt Yhn 8:33.\x*And don’t think that you can just tell yourselves that you’re descendants of Abraham, because I can tell you that \nd God\nd* could turn these stones into descendants of Abraham.
\v 10 \x + \xo 3:10: \xt Mat 7:19.\x*The axe has already been placed at the base of the trees ready to cut down any tree that’s not producing good fruit and then it’ll be thrown into the fire.
\v 11 I’m immersing people in water as a sign that they’re turning away from their sins, but there’s another one coming after me who’s greater than me—so much so that I’m not even worthy to carry his sandals. He’ll immerse you in the holy \nd spirit\nd* and fire.
\v 12 He’s already holding his fork so that he can clear his threshing floor—\add he’ll work through the pile throwing it into the air where the breeze will carry\add* the chaff away and he’ll burn that with unquenchable fire, while the \add (heavier)\add* grains of wheat will land in the pile to be brought into the barn.
\s1 Yeshua gets immersed in the river
\r (Mark 1:9-11; Luke 3:21-22)
\p
\v 13 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* came down from Galilee to Yohan at the Yordan River to be immersed by him.
\v 14 But Yohan refused, saying, “It’s me who needs to be immersed by you, and yet you’re coming to me?”
\p
\v 15 “\wj Just allow it,\wj*” answered \nd Yeshua\nd*, “\wj because we need to do what righteousness requires.\wj*” So Yohan immersed him.
\p
\v 16 As \nd Yeshua\nd* came up out of the water after being immersed, the sky was opened up and he saw God’s \nd spirit\nd* coming down like a dove and landing on him.
\v 17 \x + \xo 3:17: \xt Gen 22:2; Psa 2:7; Isa 42:1; Mat 12:18; 17:5; Mrk 1:11; Luk 9:35.\x*Then, wow, a voice came from the sky and said, “This is my son that I love and I’m pleased with.”
\c 4
\s1 Yeshua is tempted by the devil
\r (Mark 1:12-13; Luke 4:1-13)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 4:1: \xt Heb 2:18; 4:15.\x*Then \nd Yeshua\nd* was taken by the \nd spirit\nd* into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
\v 2 As he’d been fasting for forty days (and nights), he was getting hungry,
\v 3 and the tempter approached him and asked, “If you’re God’s son, command some of these stones to turn into buns.”
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 4:4: \xt Deu 8:3.\x*But Yeshua answered, “\wj It’s written in the scriptures that it’s not just food that a person needs to live, but also all of God’s message.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, and stood him on the highest point of the temple
\v 6 \x + \xo 4:6: \xt Psa 91:11-12.\x*and told him, “Throw yourself down if you’re God’s son, because it’s written \add in the scriptures\add* that God will command his messengers to look after you and to carry you in their arms so that you won’t bash your foot on a rock.”
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 4:7: \xt Deu 6:16.\x*“\wj But it’s also written,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj that you shouldn’t test \+nd Yahweh\+nd* your \+nd God\+nd*.\wj*”
\p
\v 8 Then the devil took him to a very high mountains and showed him all the countries of the world with all their splendour,
\v 9 then told him, “I’ll give all of these to you if you get down and prostrate yourself to me.”
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 4:10: \xt Deu 6:13.\x*“\wj Go away, Satan,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* replied, “\wj because it’s written \+add in the scriptures\+add* that you should worship \+nd Yahweh\+nd* your \+nd God\+nd* and should only serve him.\wj*”
\p
\v 11 Then the devil left him and \add God’s\add* messengers came and looked after him.
\s1 Yeshua begins his ministry
\r (Mark 1:14-15; Luke 4:14-15)
\p
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12: \xt Mat 14:3; Mrk 6:17; Luk 3:19-20.\x*When Yeshua heard that Yohan had been arrested, he withdrew up to Galilee.
\v 13 \x + \xo 4:13: \xt Yhn 2:12.\x*He moved from \nd Nazareth\nd* across to Capernaum beside the lake in the region that had been given to the tribes of Zebulun and Naftali
\v 14 so that what had been written by the prophet Isayah would come true,
\q1
\v 15 \x + \xo 4:15-16: \xt Isa 9:1-2.\x*‘Land of Zebulun and land of Naftali,
\q2 the way of the sea beyond the Yordan;
\q2 Galilee of the non-Jews.
\q1
\v 16 The people sitting in darkness
\q2 saw a powerful light,
\q1 and those sitting in a land under the shadow of death
\q2 had a light rise over them.’
\p
\v 17 \x + \xo 4:17: \xt Mat 3:2.\x*From then onwards, \nd Yeshua\nd* started preaching and telling people to turn from their sins because the kingdom of heavens is close.
\s1 Yeshua calls his first four followers
\r (Mark 1:16-20; Luke 5:1-11)
\p
\v 18 As he walked beside Lake Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (later nicknamed Peter) and Andrew, throwing their net into the sea because they were fishermen.
\v 19 “\wj Come and follow me,\wj*” Yeshua told them, “\wj and I’ll make you fishers of people.\wj*”
\v 20 So they left their nets immediately and followed after him.
\p
\v 21 Going on a bit further, he saw two other brothers, Yacob and Yohan, in the boat getting their nets ready along with their father Zebedee, and Yeshua also called the two of them.
\v 22 So they too immediately left the boat and their father and followed after him.
\s1 Yeshua’s healing is very popular
\r (Luke 6:17-19)
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 4:23: \xt Mat 9:35; Mrk 1:39.\x*Then \nd Yeshua\nd* went around all of Galilee, teaching in their Jewish meeting halls and proclaiming the good message about the kingdom, and healing all the diseases and sicknesses of the people
\v 24 and the news about this went all the way up to Syria.
\v 25 Large crowds from Galilee and Decapolis and Yerushalem, and from all of Yudea and even beyond the Yordan River, followed after Yeshua.
\c 5
\s1 Yeshua’s sermon on the hillside
\r (Luke 6:20-23)
\p
\v 1 After seeing all the crowds, Yeshua climbed up a hill, and when he sat down, his apprentices approached him
\v 2 and he taught them:
\p
\v 3 “\wj Those who are poor in the spirit are blessed, because the kingdom of the heavens is theirs.\wj*
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 5:4: \xt Isa 61:2.\x*“\wj Those who are mourning are blessed, because they will be comforted.\wj*
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 5:5: \xt Psa 37:11.\x*“\wj Those who are gentle are blessed, because they will inherit the earth.\wj*
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 5:6: \xt Isa 55:1-2.\x*“\wj Those who are hungry and thirsty to obey God are blessed, because they will be satisfied.\wj*
\p
\v 7 “\wj Those who are merciful are blessed, because they will receive mercy.\wj*
\p
\v 8 \x + \xo 5:8: \xt Psa 24:3.\x*“\wj Those who have pure hearts are blessed, because they will see \+nd God\+nd*.\wj*
\p
\v 9 “\wj Those who are peacemakers are blessed, because they will be called children of \+nd God\+nd*.\wj*
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 5:10: \xt 1Pe 3:14.\x*“\wj Those who are persecuted for being godly are blessed, because the kingdom of heavens belongs to them.\wj*
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 5:11: \xt 1Pe 4:14.\x*“\wj Everyone who is derided or chased or lied about is blessed, along with those who have evil things said about them just because they \+add follow\+add* me.\wj*
\v 12 \x + \xo 5:12: \xt 2Ch 36:16; Acts 7:52.\x*\wj Be happy and praising \+add God\+add* because you’ll all have a wonderful reward in the heavens, because \+add in the past\+add* they also persecuted the prophets like that.\wj*
\s1 Being salt and light
\r (Mark 9:50; Luke 14:34-35)
\p
\v 13 \x + \xo 5:13: \xt Mrk 9:50; Luk 14:34-35.\x*“\wj You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt is made tasteless, what would you all use to salt your food? The salt wouldn’t be useful for anything anymore and would just get thrown out and trampled on by the people.\wj*
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 5:14: \xt Yhn 8:12; 9:5.\x*“\wj You are the light of the world. A city up on a hill can’t be hidden.\wj*
\v 15 \x + \xo 5:15: \xt Mrk 4:21; Luk 8:16; 11:33.\x*\wj No one lights a lamp and puts it under a basket—you put it on a lampstand and it lightens up the house.\wj*
\v 16 \x + \xo 5:16: \xt 1Pe 2:12.\x*\wj In the same way, let your light shine in front of everyone, so that they can see your good behaviour and then might praise your father in the heavens.\wj*
\s1 Mosheh’s law won’t be broken
\p
\v 17 “\wj Don’t imagine that I came to criticise the prophets or \+add Mosheh’s\+add* law. I didn’t come to oppose \+add the scriptures\+add*, but to fulfil them,\wj*
\v 18 \x + \xo 5:18: \xt Luk 16:17.\x*\wj because I can assure you all that until heaven and earth reach their end, not one letter or mark will be taken away from the law until everything is fulfilled.\wj*
\v 19 \wj Therefore anyone who breaks even a minor command and teaches others to do the same, will be seen as one of the least in the kingdom of the heavens, but anyone who practices and teaches the law will be considered outstanding in the kingdom.\wj*
\v 20 \wj Let me tell all of you, unless you’re more godly than the teachers of the law and the Pharisees, there’s no way that you’ll get to enter the kingdom of the heavens.\wj*
\s1 Teaching about murder and anger
\p
\v 21 “\wj You all heard that your ancestors were told not to murder because any murderer will be sentenced.\wj*\x + \xo 5:21: \xt Exo 20:13; Deu 5:17.\x*
\v 22 \wj But I’m telling you that anyone who gets angry at another will be liable for judgement, and anyone who calls another person a numbskull will have to face the court, and if you call them a fool, you’re liable for hellfire.\wj*
\v 23 \wj So if you’re there at the altar to offer your gift and remember that someone has something against you,\wj*
\v 24 \wj leave your gift there at the altar and go and sort that out first, before coming back to offer your gift.\wj*
\p
\v 25 “\wj Resolve things with your opponent as soon as you can, hopefully while you’re still on the way \+add to the court\+add*, in case your opponent turns you in to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and then you’ll end up in prison.\wj*
\v 26 \wj I can assure you that you won’t get out of prison until the fine is completely paid.\wj*
\s1 Teaching about adultery and lust
\p
\v 27 “\wj You all know that \+add the scriptures\+add* say not to commit adultery,\wj*\x + \xo 5:27: \xt Exo 20:14; Deu 5:18.\x*
\v 28 \wj but I’m telling you that if you look at a woman lustfully then you’ve already committed adultery in your mind.\wj*
\v 29 \wj If your right eye is causing you to stumble, then pluck it out and throw it away\wj*\x + \xo 5:29: \xt Mat 18:9; Mrk 9:47.\x*
\v 30 \wj and if your right hand is causing you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away, because it’s better for you that one of your \+add ≈body parts\+add* would \+add ≈be taken than for\+add* your whole body to \+add ≈end up in the judgement fire\+add*.\wj*\x + \xo 5:30: \xt Mat 18:8; Mrk 9:43.\x*
\s1 Teaching about divorce
\r (Mat. 19:9; Mark 10:11-12; Luke 16:18)
\p
\v 31 \x + \xo 5:31: \xt Deu 24:1-4; Mat 19:7; Mrk 10:4.\x*“\wj It’s said that any man can divorce his wife just by sending her away.\wj*
\v 32 \x + \xo 5:32: \xt Mat 19:9; Mrk 10:11-12; Luk 16:18; 1Cor 7:10-11.\x*\wj But I’m telling you all that anyone who sends his wife away, except in the case where she’s committed sexual immorality, is causing her to commit adultery, and anyone who marries a wife that’s been sent away, is causing \+add her\+add* to be committing adultery.\wj*
\s1 Teaching about oaths and honesty
\p

\v 8 “But \nd master\nd*,” the commander replied, “I’m not worthy that you should come to my house, but just give the command and my slave will be healed,

\v 16 In the evening, the people brought many who were possessed by evil spirits and Yeshua drove out the spirits with a command and healed all of them that were sick.

\v 24 Then wow, a huge storm rose up on the lake and the waves started coming into the boat, but Yeshua was asleep.
\v 25 They woke him up and pleaded, “\nd Master\nd*, save us, we’re going to drown.”
\p
\v 26 “\wj What are you worried about,\wj*”, asked Yeshua, “\wj you who don’t have much faith.\wj*” Then he stood up and told the winds and the water to stop, and the lake became very calm.

\s1 Yeshua banishes demons into a herd of pigs

\p
\v 30 Now there was a herd of many pigs grazing not far away from them,
\v 31 and the demons begged Yeshua saying, “If you do drive us out, send us into the herd of pigs.”
\p
\v 32 And he said to them, “Depart!” So they came out and went away into the pigs, and next thing all the herd rushed down the bank into the lake and drowned in the water.
\p
\v 33 Then the men who had been grazing them took off, and when they got to the city they reported everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed men.
\v 34 Soon all the city came out to meet with \nd Yeshua\nd*, and when they found him they asked him to leave their region.

\p
\v 3 Immediately some of the law teachers said among themselves, “This man presumes to be God.”
\p
\v 4 But \nd Yeshua\nd* knew their thoughts and said, “Why are you thinking evil things in your hearts?
\v 5 Do you think it’s easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’?
\v 6 But so that you will know that humanity’s child has the authority here on earth to forgive sins,” he said, “stand up, take your stretcher, and go to your house.”
\p
\v 7 Then the man stood up and went off to his house.

\v 11 Some of the Pharisee party noticed this and said to his disciples, “How come your teacher eats with tax collectors and sinners?”
\p
\v 12 But Yeshua heard this and said, “People who are well don’t need a doctor—only the ones with problems do.
\v 13 \x + \xo 9:13: a \xt Mat 12:7; \xo b \xt Hos 6:6.\x*So go and find out the meaning of this: I like mercy not sacrifice. Because it’s sinners that I came to call, not those \add considered\add* righteous.”
\s1 Yeshua is asked about fasting
\r (Mark 2:18-22; Luke 5:33-39)
\p
\v 14 Then the disciples of Yohan approached Yeshua and said, “How come that we and the Pharisees fast regularly, but your disciples don’t fast?”
\p
\v 15 And \nd Yeshua\nd* replied to them, “Surely the groomsmen aren’t sad while the groom is with them? But the time will come when the groom has to leave them and then they will fast.
\p
\v 16 No one patches old clothes with new material because the patch will shrink and the clothes would end up with a worse hole.
\v 17 And they don’t put new wine into an old container, otherwise the container could split and be ruined and the wine would be lost. Rather they put new wine into a new container and both survive.”
\s1 Yeshua raises a dead girl and heals a woman from bleeding
\r (Mark 5:21-43; Luke 8:40-56)
\p
\v 18 While Yeshua was speaking to them, an official came and bowed to him saying, “My daughter has just passed away, but come and put your hand on her and she will revive.
\p
\v 19 So \nd Yeshua\nd* and his disciples got up and followed him.
\p
\v 20 Just then a woman who had been bleeding internally for twelve years came up behind Yeshua and touched the edge of his robe
\v 21 because she had told herself that if she could just touch his robe, she would be healed.
\p
\v 22 \nd Yeshua\nd* turned and saw her and said, “Be encouraged, daughter, your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed that very moment.
\p
\v 23 Now when \nd Yeshua\nd* went into the house of the ruler, he saw the funeral musicians and the distressed people
\v 24 and he said, “Go away. The girl hasn’t died—she’s sleeping.” But they ridiculed him.
\v 25 However when the crowd was moved out, he went in and took her hand, and the girl got up.
\v 26 Then the news of this spread all around that region.
\s1 Yeshua heals two blind men
\p
\v 27 As \nd Yeshua\nd* left the ruler’s home, two blind men followed him and called out, “Have mercy on us, son of David.”
\p
\v 28 When he went into the house, the blind men went to him and \nd Yeshua\nd* said to them, “Do you believe that I’m able to do this?”
\p They replied, “Yes, \nd master\nd*.”
\p
\v 29 Then he touched their eyes saying, “Let it be done to you in line with your faith.”
\v 30 Then their eyes were healed and \nd Yeshua\nd* told them, “Don’t let anyone know about this.”
\p
\v 31 But after they had departed, the men told the whole region about him.
\s1 Yeshua heals a man who couldn’t talk
\p
\v 32 As they were leaving, some people brought a man to Yeshua who was demon-possessed and unable to talk.
\v 33 After the demon was cast out, the man was able to speak and the crowds were amazed saying, “Never before has anything like this happened in Yisrael.”

\s1 Yeshua and Yohan-the-immerser
\r (Luke 7:18-35)
\p
\v 1 When \nd Yeshua\nd* had finished giving those instructions to his twelve apprentices, he \add also\add* left there and went to teach and preach in the Jewish cities.
\p
\v 2 Then Yohan, who was in prison, heard about what the \nd messiah\nd* was doing, he sent some of his apprentices
\v 3 to ask Yeshua, “Are you the promised one, or should we be waiting for someone else?”
\p
\v 4 “\wj \+add Well,\+add*\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj go and tell Yohan everything that you’re hearing and seeing:\wj*
\v 5 \x + \xo 11:5: a \xt Isa 35:5-6; \xo b \xt Isa 61:1.\x*\wj those who were blind can see now, lame people are now walking, people will leprosy are ‘clean’, deaf people can now hear, dead people have been brought back to life, and the good message is being preached to the poor.\wj*
\v 6 \wj Anyone who’s not embarrassed by me will be blessed.\wj*”
\p
\v 7 As Yohan’s apprentices left, Yeshua started talking to the crowd about Yohan: “\wj What was it that you all went out to the wilderness to see? A reed being blown around by the wind?\wj*\f + \fr 11:7 \ft We’ve left the original idiom here in the OET-RV as something to puzzle over, because no one now really knows what aspect of Yohan’s behaviour or appearance that Yeshua was referring to here.\f*”
\v 8 \wj Yes, what did you all go out to see? A man wearing fine clothes? People in palaces wear fine clothes.\wj*
\v 9 \wj So why did you go out \+add there\+add*? To see a prophet? Yes, I’m telling you that \+add he is a prophet\+add*, and even more important than the prophets.\wj*
\v 10 \x + \xo 11:10: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*\wj He is the one that was written about: ‘See, I’m sending out my messenger ahead of you and he’ll prepare your path before you.’\wj*
\v 11 \wj I can assure you that no person who’s ever been born is greater than Yohan-the-immerser. But even the least important person in the kingdom of heavens is greater than him.\wj*
\v 12 \x + \xo 11:12-13: \xt Luk 16:16.\x*\wj From the time of Yohan-the-immerser through to the present time, the kingdom of the heavens has been opposed, and the opposition is grabbing at it.\wj*

\p
\v 16 “\wj So what should I liken this generation to? It’s like young children sitting in the town centre who are calling out to others\wj*
\v 17 \wj and saying, ‘We played lively music for you but you didn’t dance. Then we played sad music, but you didn’t mourn.’\wj*
\v 18 \wj Because Yohan came and he wasn’t eating or drinking, and they said, ‘He’s possessed by a demon!’\wj*
\v 19 \wj Then humanity’s child came and he was eating and drinking, but they said, ‘Look at this fellow—he’s a glutton and a drunkard—a friend of tax collectors and immoral people.’ But wisdom is only recognised with hindsight.\wj*
\s1 Cities that rejected the messiah
\r (Luke 10:13-15)
\p
\v 20 Then Yeshua began deriding the cities that he had done most of his miracles in, because they hadn’t turned from their sins.
\v 21 \x + \xo 11:21: \xt Isa 23:1-18; Eze 26:1–28:26; Yoel 3:4-8; Amos 1:9-10; Zech 9:2-4.\x*“\wj Chorazin you’re doomed. Bethsaida you’re doomed.

\v 22 \wj However, I’m telling you all that it will be more tolerable for the people of Tyre and Tsidon on judgement day than it will be for you.\wj*

\s1 Yeshua’s load is light
\r (Luke 10:21-22)
\p
\v 25 At that time \nd Yeshua\nd* said, “\wj I am acknowledging you, father, \+nd master\+nd* of the heaven and earth, that you hid these things from ‘wise’ and ‘intelligent’ people and revealed them to the ‘naive’.\wj*

\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 12:3-4: \xt 1Sam 21:1-6.\x*“\wj Haven’t you read about what David did when him and his fighters were hungry?\wj*” Yeshua responded.

\s1 The man with the clawed fist
\r (Mark 3:1-6; Luke 6:6-11)
\p
\v 9 After leaving that place, Yeshua went into the Jewish meeting hall,
\v 10 and look, there was a man there with a clawed fist. So the people there asked Yeshua if it was permitted to heal people on the rest days.
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 12:11: \xt Luk 14:5.\x*“\wj Which of you,\wj*” Yeshua responded, “\wj if you owned a single sheep and it fell into a pit on a rest day, wouldn’t then grab hold of it and lift it out?\wj*
\v 12 \wj Now a human is worth much more than a sheep, so then it must be permissible to do good on a rest day.\wj*”
\v 13 Then he said to the man, “\wj Stretch out your hand.\wj*”
\p The man stretched his hand out and it was restored—now just as healthy as the other one,
\v 14 but the Pharisees came out and sought legal advice because they wanted to ruin Yeshua.
\s1 Yeshua was chosen by God
\p
\v 15 \nd Yeshua\nd* knew what they were trying to do, so he left that place. A lot of people followed along after him and he healed them all
\v 16 but warned them not to reveal who he was
\v 17 in order to fulfil what the prophet Isayah had written:
\q1
\v 18 \x + \xo 12:18-21: \xt Isa 42:1-4 (LXX).\x*‘See my servant who I chose,
\q1 the one I dearly love and who my soul takes pleasure in.

\q2 and he will bring justice to the nations.
\q1
\v 19 He won’t be arguing or yelling out,
\q2 and no one on the roads will hear his voice.
\q1
\v 20 He won’t break off a bruised reed
\q2 and certainly won’t extinguish a smoldering wick
\q1 before he sends justice forward into victory.
\q1
\v 21 The other nations will put their hope in his name and authority.’
\s1 Yeshua accused of being the leader of demons
\r (Mark 3:20-30; Luke 11:14-23)
\p
\v 22 Then a man possessed by evil spirits was brought to Yeshua. He was blind and unable to speak, but Yeshua healed him so that he could both speak and see.
\v 23 All the people were amazed and were saying, “Surely this must be the \add promised\add* descendant of David?”
\p
\v 24 \x + \xo 12:24: \xt Mat 9:34; 10:25.\x*When the Pharisees’ party heard about that, they said, “That man is only driving out demons because he’s Beelzebul, the leader of the demons.”
\p
\v 25 But Yeshua, knowing their thoughts, said, “\wj Every kingdom that’s divided against itself is doomed, and any city or household that’s divided against itself will self-destruct.\wj*
\v 26 \wj If Satan is driving out Satan, then he’s divided against himself and how could his kingdom possibly be established?\wj*
\v 27 \wj And if I’m driving out demons by Beelzebul, then by who are your sons driving them out?\wj*
\v 28 \wj But if I am driving out demons by God’s \+nd spirit\+nd*, then that must mean that God’s kingdom has \+add already\+add* arrived among you all.\wj*

\v 43 “\wj Whenever an evil spirit comes out of a person, it goes through arid lands looking for a place to rest, and doesn’t find any.\wj*
\v 44 \wj So it says to itself, ‘I’ll go back to the house that I just left.’ Then when it gets back, it finds that it’s not only unoccupied, but it’s been swept and tidied up.\wj*

\p
\v 48 “\wj Who’s my mother and who are my siblings?\wj*” Yeshua answered to that person.

\v 4 \wj As he was spreading the seed, some of it fell beside a path and the birds come and ate that seed.\wj*
\v 5 \wj Some fell on stony ground where there wasn’t much soil, and it sprouted immediately because the thin layer of soil \+add was moist and warm\+add*,\wj*
\v 6 \wj but when the sun rose high, it was scorched and not having any deep roots, it withered up.\wj*
\v 7 \wj Some seed fell in a thistle patch, but the thistles grew over them and choked them out.\wj*
\v 8 \wj However, some seed landed on the good soil and it grew to bear a harvest—some a hundred times more, some sixty times, and some thirty times.\wj*
\v 9 \wj Anyone who wants to hear should strive to understand this.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua’s use of parables
\r (Mark 4:10-12; Luke 8:9-10)

\v 10 After this, his apprentices came to him and asked, “Why do you speak to the people in parables?”

\v 12 \x + \xo 13:12: \xt Mat 25:29; Mrk 4:25; Luk 8:18; 19:26.\x*\wj Because anyone who already has will be given more and they will end up with plenty, but anyone who doesn’t have, even what they have will be taken away from them.\wj*
\v 13 \wj That’s why I speak to them in parables, because when they look they don’t see, and when they listen, they don’t hear or understand,\wj*
\v 14 \x + \xo 13:14-15: \xt Isa 6:9-10 (LXX).\x*\wj and so the prophecy \+add written\+add* by Isayah is being fulfilled:\wj*
\q1 \wj ‘When you listen you will hear but you certainly won’t understand,\wj*
\q1 \wj and when you look you will see but you certainly won’t perceive anything.\wj*
\q1
\v 15 \wj Because these people’s hearts are insensitive and they can barely hear with their ears,\wj*
\q1 \wj and they shut their eyes so they can’t see with them.\wj*

\v 22 \wj The seed the landed among the thorns is the person who hears the message, but the worries of the time and the seduction of wealth chokes out the message and it becomes unfruitful.\wj*
\v 23 \wj The seed that landed on the good soil is the person who hears the message and understands it and goes on to bear fruit—some people producing a hundred times more, some sixty times, and some thirty times.\wj*”\f + \fr 13:23 \ft See http://scrollandscreen.com/biblestudyresources/Matthew%2013.1-23%20mgvh%20notes.pdf\f*
\s1 The parable about the bad wheat
\p
\v 24 Then Yeshua told them another parable, saying, “\wj The kingdom of the heavens is like a farmer who’s planted good seed in his field.\wj*
\v 25 \wj But the while they were all sleeping, his enemy came and spread black-grained ‘wheat’ seeds around his wheat field and left again.\wj*
\v 26 \wj Then when the wheat grew and produced grains, the \+add poisonous\+add* ‘wheat’ could also be seen.\wj*
\v 27 \wj The farmer’s slave came and told him, ‘Master, wasn’t it \+em good\+em* wheat seed that you planted? So why is there so much false wheat?’\wj*
\v 28 \wj ‘An enemy must have done this,’ the farmer replied. ‘So should we go and pull out the bad stuff,’ asked the slaves.\wj*
\v 29 \wj ‘No,’ said the farmer, ‘because pulling that out might also pull up some of the wheat plants.\wj*
\v 30 \wj ‘Let them all grown together, and then at harvest time I can just tell the harvesters to pull the false wheat plants out first and put then in bundles to be incinerated, and then harvest the wheat to go into my barn.’\wj* ”
\s1 The parable about the small mustard seed
\r (Mark 4:30-32; Luke 13:18-19)
\p
\v 31 Another one of his parables went like this: “\wj The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed that a man planted in his field.\wj*
\v 32 \wj Even though it’s a very small seed, it grows larger than \+add most\+add* garden plants and becomes such a large bush that birds even come and nest in its branches.\wj*”
\s1 The parable about the yeast
\r (Luke 13:20-21)
\p
\v 33 In another parable, Yeshua said, “\wj The kingdom of the heavens is like yeast, which a woman took and hid it in a month’s worth of flour, and eventually all of it rose.\wj*”
\s1 The reason Yeshua used parables
\r (Mark 4:33-34)
\p
\v 34 \nd Yeshua\nd* told all these things to the crowds in the form of parables, in fact he said nothing that wasn’t a parable,
\v 35 \x + \xo 13:35: \xt Psa 78:2.\x*so that that what had been \add written\add* by the prophet would be fulfilled:
\q1 ‘I will be saying things that have been hidden since the creation of the world.’
\s1 Yeshua explains about the false wheat
\p
\v 36 Then Yeshua left the crowd and went into the house. His apprentices followed him in and asked him for the interpretation of the parable about the poisonous black wheat in the field.
\p
\v 37 “\wj The farmer spreading the good seed,\wj*” Yeshua answered, “\wj is humanity’s child,\wj*
\v 38 \wj and the field is the world and the good seeds are the heirs to the kingdom. The false wheat seeds are the disciples of the evil one,\wj*
\v 39 \wj and the enemy who planted them in the devil. The harvest is at the end of this age, and the harvesters are \+add God’s\+add* messengers.\wj*
\v 40 \wj Therefore at the end of this age, the false wheat plants will be gathered and incinerated.\wj*
\v 41 \wj humanity’s child will be sending out his messengers to remove all the temptations out of his kingdom, and all those who don’t obey \+add God’s\+add* law,\wj*
\v 42 \wj and they will throw them into the incinerator, and there will be crying and much anguish.\wj*
\v 43 \wj Then the godly people will be shining \+add as bright as\+add* the sun in their father’s kingdom. Anyone who is interested to hear, let them listen.\wj*
\s1 The parable about the treasure in the field
\p
\v 44 “\wj The kingdom of the heavens is like a field that had had treasure hidden in it. When someone found the treasure, they hid it again, and with great excitement went and sold everything they had so they could buy that field.\wj*
\s1 The parable about the valuable pearl
\p
\v 45 “\wj Also the kingdom of the heavens is like a trader wanting to buy beautiful pearls,\wj*
\v 46 \wj and when they found one outstanding pearl, they went and sold everything they had so they could buy that pearl.\wj*
\s1 The parable about the dragnet
\p
\v 47 “\wj Also the kingdom of the heavens is like a dragnet that was thrown into the lake and picked up everything from under the water.\wj*
\v 48 \wj When it was full, they pulled it up onto the beach and sat and sorted the catch—throwing the good catch into containers and throwing out the bad stuff.\wj*
\v 49 \wj It’ll be just like that at the end of this age—\+add God’s\+add* messengers will be coming out and will separate evil people from the godly people,\wj*
\v 50 \wj and they will throw the evil ones into the incinerator. There will be crying and great anguish.\wj*
\p
\v 51 “\wj Did you all understand all of that?\wj*
\p “Yes,” his apprentices answered.
\p
\v 52 Then he said to them, “\wj Because of this, every teacher who’s been trained about the kingdom of the heavens is like a person who’s a home owner who gives presents of both new and old things of out their valuables.\wj*”
\s1 Those from Nazareth cannot accept the messiah
\r (Mark 6:1-6; Luke 4:16-30)
\p
\v 53 After \nd Yeshua\nd* had finished explaining the parables, he left that place
\v 54 and went to his hometown \add of Nazareth\add* and taught the people in the Jewish meeting hall. They were amazed at his teaching, asking \add each other\add*, “Where did this fellow get his wisdom and his ability to do miracles?
\v 55 Isn’t he the son of Yosef, the carpenter? Don’t we know his mother Maria and his brothers Yacob and Yosef and Simon and Yudas?
\v 56 Aren’t his sisters still here in town? So where did he get all these abilities?”
\v 57 \x + \xo 13:57: \xt Yhn 4:44.\x*As a result, they didn’t have any respect for him.
\p But \nd Yeshua\nd* said to them, “\wj A prophet is not dishonoured except in his own hometown and among his own household.\wj*”
\v 58 So he didn’t do many miracles there because of their unbelief.
\c 14
\s1 The beheading of Yohan-the-immerser
\r (Mark 6:14-29; Luke 9:7-9)
\p
\v 1 Around that time, \add King\add* Herod the Tetrarch heard the news about \nd Yeshua\nd*
\v 2 and he said to his slaves, “This must be Yohan-the-immerser having come back from the dead and so that’s why he can do all these miracles!”
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 14:3-4: \xt Luk 3:19-20.\x*Herod said this because he had previously had Yohan arrested and put in prison because of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.
\v 4 Yohan had been saying that it was against God’s law for Herod to take his brother’s wife.
\v 5 Herod had been wanting to have Yohan executed, but he was afraid of the crowd because they considered Yohan to be a prophet.
\p
\v 6 However at Herod’s birthday celebration, Herodias’ daughter had danced in the middle of them all and had pleased Herod so much
\v 7 that he promised with an oath to give her anything that she requested.
\p
\v 8 The young woman was urged on by her mother to tell Herod that she wanted the head of Yohan-the-immerser on a plate.
\p
\v 9 The king was upset, but because of his oaths in front of the other guests, he commanded it to be so
\v 10 and sent \add his soldiers\add* to behead Yohan in prison.
\v 11 So then his head was brought in on a plate and given to the young woman who then took it to her mother.
\v 12 \add Hearing the news,\add* Yohan’s followers went \add to the prison\add* and collected his body and buried it. Then they went and told \nd Yeshua\nd*.
\s1 The feeding of 5,000 families
\r (Mark 6:30-44; Luke 9:10-17; Yhn 6:1-14)
\p
\v 13 When \nd Yeshua\nd* heard \add what had happened to Yohan\add*, he got a boat to take him to a quiet place by himself, but the crowds from the cities heard about it, and followed him around the shore of the lake on foot.
\v 14 So when he got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd of people and he felt compassion towards them, and he healed the sick people \add that they had brought\add*.
\p
\v 15 As evening was approaching, his followers came up and asked, “This place is quite isolated and it’s already late. Send the people back into the villages so they can buy themselves something to eat.”
\p
\v 16 “\wj Oh, there’s no need to send them away,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered. “\wj you all give them something to eat.\wj*”
\p
\v 17 “We don’t have anything here” they responded, “except for five buns and two \add cooked\add* fish.”
\p
\v 18 “\wj Bring them here to me,\wj*” Yeshua instructed,
\v 19 then he told the crowds to sit down on the grass. He took the five buns and two fish and looking up to the sky, he blessed \add God/the food/the people???\add*, broke the buns and gave the pieces to his apprentices to distribute to the crowds.
\v 20 Everyone there ate enough to be full, and then \add the apprentices\add* picked up twelve baskets of leftover bread.
\v 21 There were about five thousand families there.
\s1 Yeshua and Peter walk on the lake
\r (Mark 6:45-52; Yhn 6:15-21)
\p
\v 22 Straight after that, Yeshua instructed his apprentices to board the boat and to head back to the other side of the lake while he dismissed the crowds.
\v 23 He sent them all back to their homes, then climbed up a hill by himself to pray.
\v 24 By then the boat was in the middle of the lake, but it was being beaten by the waves because a strong wind had come up.
\p
\v 25 In the early hours of the morning, Yeshua went out to them on the lake, walking on the surface.
\v 26 When his apprentices saw him coming over the lake, they were worried thinking it was a ghost and yelling out in fear.
\p
\v 27 But \nd Yeshua\nd* answered them immediately saying, “\wj Be brave, I’m here, don’t worry.\wj*”
\p
\v 28 “\nd Master\nd*,” called Peter, “if it’s you, command me to come to you on the lake.”
\p
\v 29 “\wj Come!\wj*” he said. So Peter climbed \add over the back\add* of the boat and started walking across the lake towards \nd Yeshua\nd*,
\v 30 but when he looked \add around\add* at the wind, he lost his nerve and started sinking and yelled out, “\nd Master\nd*, save me!”
\v 31 Immediately \nd Yeshua\nd* stretched out his hand and took hold of Peter and said to him, “\wj Your faith is weak because why did you doubt?\wj*”
\p
\v 32 Then as soon as the two of them climbed into the boat, the wind died down
\v 33 and everyone in the boat knelt down in front of Yeshua saying, “You certainly must be God’s son!”
\s1 The sick are healed just by touching Yeshua’s clothes
\r (Mark 6:53-56)
\p
\v 34 So then they finished crossing the lake and got out at Gennesaret.
\v 35 The people there recognised Yeshua and sent news to all the surrounding region. So the people brought all their sick relatives to him
\v 36 and begged him even to just let them touch the edge of his robe because everyone who did that was healed.
\c 15
\s1 Obeying God versus tradition
\r (Mark 7:1-13)
\p
\v 1 Then some from the Pharisees’ party and teachers of the law from Yerushalem arrived and asked \nd Yeshua\nd*,
\v 2 “Why do your followers break the traditions handed down by our elders? They’re not practicing the washing hands ceremony before eating.”
\p
\v 3 “\wj Well why also do you break God’s command because of your tradition?\wj*” Yeshua responded.
\v 4 \x + \xo 15:4: a \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16; \xo b \xt Exo 21:17; Lev 20:9.\x*“\wj \+nd God\+nd* told us to honour our father and our mother, and also that anyone who speaks evil about their father or mother deserves the death penalty.\wj*
\v 5 \wj But you all say that anyone who tells their father or mother that whatever \+add help\+add* they may have expected from you is now given as a gift,\wj*
\v 6 \wj then you say that they’re not \+add actually\+add* dishonouring their parents. So by saying that, you’re overriding God’s message with your own tradition.\wj*
\v 7 \wj You hypocrites! The prophet Isayah was right about you all when he wrote:\wj*\x + \xo 15:7-9: \xt Isa 29:13 (LXX).\x*
\q1
\v 8 \wj ‘These people honour me with their lips,\wj*
\q2 \wj But their hearts are far away from me.\wj*
\q1
\v 9 \wj Their worship of me is useless,\wj*
\q2 \wj They teach human ideas as if they’re commands.’\wj* ”
\s1 True ‘dirtiness’
\r (Mark 7:14-23)
\p
\v 10 Then Yeshua called out to the crowd, “\wj Listen carefully so you can understand this:\wj*
\v 11 \wj It’s not what goes into your mouth that defiles you, but rather, it’s what comes out of your mouth.\wj*”
\p
\v 12 His followers then came up to him and told him, “You know that the Pharisees were offended by what you just said?”
\p
\v 13 “\wj Every plant,\wj*” Yeshua answered, “\wj that wasn’t planted by my heavenly father will get pulled out.\wj*
\v 14 \x + \xo 15:14: \xt Luk 6:39.\x*\wj Just ignore them. They are blind guides, and if blind people are leading the blind, both of them will stumble into a pit.\wj*”
\p
\v 15 But Peter asked him, “So interpret the parable for us.”
\p
\v 16 “\wj Can’t you all figure it out yet?\wj*” Yeshua replied.
\v 17 \wj Can’t you all see that everything that goes into your mouth, goes down into your stomach and then eventually ends up in the toilet?\wj*
\v 18 \x + \xo 15:18: \xt Mat 12:34.\x*\wj But the things that come out of your mouth are coming from your mind and that’s what defiles a person.\wj*
\v 19 \wj Because lust, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, stealing, falsely accusing and slander, these all come of the mind.\wj*
\v 20 \wj It’s those things that defile a person, not eating without \+add ceremonially\+add* washing your hands.\wj*”
\s1 The non-Jewish woman with amazing faith
\r (Mark 7:24-30)
\p
\v 21 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* left Galilee and went out to the districts of Tyre and Tsidon.
\v 22 Then, look, a woman from that area and of Caananite ancestry came to hum and called out, “\nd Master\nd*, David’s descendant, my daughter is suffering from demon possession.”
\p
\v 23 But Yeshua didn’t even answer her. So his apprentices came up and suggested, “Send her away because she’s still yelling out back there.”
\p
\v 24 Yeshua answered, “\wj I was only sent to the lost sheep that descended from Yisrael.\wj*”
\p
\v 25 But she came and knelt down in front of him, begging, “\nd Master\nd*, help me.”
\p
\v 26 “\wj It’s not good,\wj*”, Yeshua responded, “\wj to take the children’s food off them and throw it out to the puppies.\wj*”
\p
\v 27 “True, \nd master\nd*,” she said, “but even the puppies eat the little crumbs that fall off their masters’ table.”
\p
\v 28 “\wj Oh, woman\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj you have lots of faith, so what you asked for will become reality.\wj*” And so her daughter was healed that very hour.
\s1 Yeshua heals many different afflictions
\p
\v 29 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* left that place and after walking along Lake Galilee, he climbed up a hill and sat down.
\v 30 Big crowds came up to him, bringing those who were lame, maimed, blind, mute, and many others, and they laid them down in front of him and he healed them.
\v 31 The crowds marvelled, seeing people speaking that had been mute, and maimed people now healthy, and lame people walking and the blind now seeing, and they praised Yisrael’s \nd God\nd*.
\s1 The feeding of 4,000 families
\r (Mark 8:1-10)
\p
\v 32 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* called his apprentices and told them, “\wj I feel sorry for this crowd because they’ve been out here with me for three days and haven’t had anything to eat, but I’m not happy to just send them away hungry in case they collapse on the way home.\wj*”
\p
\v 33 “Out here in the wilderness,” replied his apprentices, “where could we possibly get enough bread to feed a crowd this size?”
\p
\v 34 “\wj How many buns do you have?\wj*” asked \nd Yeshua\nd*.
\p “Seven,”, they replied, “and a few small fish.”
\p
\v 35 Then instructing the crowd to sit down on the ground,
\v 36 he took the seven buns and the fish, and gave thanks. Then he broke them and gave the pieces to his apprentices to distribute to the crowds.
\v 37 Everyone ate and when they were full, they collected seven baskets full of the leftover food.
\v 38 There were about four thousand families there.
\p
\v 39 After sending the crowds home, Yeshua got into the boat and they went to the regions of Magadan.
\c 16
\s1 Requesting a sign in the sky
\r (Mark 8:11-13; Luke 12:54-56)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 16:1: \xt Mat 12:38; Luk 11:16.\x*Some from the Pharisee party and some from the Sadducee sect approached Yeshua, and trying to tempt him they asked him to make a sign in the sky to show \add his power\add* to them.
\v 2 But in answer he said to them,
\v 3 ◘
\v 4 \x + \xo 16:4: \xt Mat 12:39; Luk 11:29.\x*“\wj This is an evil and adulterous generation that’s wanting a sign, and no sign will be given to it except for the sign of Yonah.\wj*” Then he left them and went away.
\s1 The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees
\r (Mark 8:14-21)
\p
\v 5 Now Yeshua’s apprentices had crossed the lake, but they forgot to take any yeast
\v 6 \x + \xo 16:6: \xt Luk 12:1.\x*and \nd Yeshua\nd* told them, “\wj Watch out for the yeast from the Pharisees and the Sadducees.\wj*”
\p
\v 7 This caused a discussion among them trying to figure out if he was scolding them for not bringing any bread.
\p
\v 8 But \nd Yeshua\nd* knew what they were saying, and asked them, “\wj You all with little faith. Why are you discussing among yourselves about not having bread?\wj*
\v 9 \x + \xo 16:9: \xt Mat 14:17-21.\x*\wj Haven’t you understood what’s going on here yet? Don’t you remember that there were twelve baskets of leftovers when five buns were used to feed 5,000 families?\wj*
\v 10 \x + \xo 16:10: \xt Mat 15:34-38.\x*\wj And then seven baskets of leftovers when seven buns were used to feed 4,000 families?\wj*
\v 11 \wj How can you fail to understand that I wasn’t talking to you about bread? Watch out for the yeast from the Pharisees and Sadducees.\wj*
\p
\v 12 Then they understood that he wasn’t talking about yeast that’s used to make bread, but about the teaching of the Pharisee party and of the Sadducee sect.
\s1 Peter acknowledges Yeshua as God’s son
\r (Mark 8:27-30; Luke 9:18-21)
\p
\v 13 When \nd Yeshua\nd* arrived in the outskirts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his apprentices, “\wj Who are people saying that humanity’s child \+em is\+em*?\wj*”
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 16:14: \xt Mat 14:1-2; Mrk 6:14-15; Luk 9:7-8.\x*“Some say Yohan-the-immerser \add come back to life\add*,” they answered, “but others say the \add promised prophet\add* Eliyyah, and others, Jeremiah or one of the other prophets.”
\p
\v 15 “\wj But you yourselves,\wj*” he asked, “\wj Who do \+em you\+em* say I am?\wj*”
\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 16:16: \xt Yhn 6:68-69.\x*“You are the \add promised\add* \nd messiah\nd*,” Simon Peter answered, “the son of the living \nd God\nd*.”
\p
\v 17 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj You are blessed, Simon BarYonah, because it wasn’t any person that revealed that to you, but rather, my father who is in the heavens.\wj*
\v 18 \wj And I can add that you are Peter \+add (meaning ‘rock’)\+add* and I will build my assembly on this rock and the gates of hell won’t be able to hold it back.\wj*
\v 19 \x + \xo 16:19: \xt Mat 18:18; Yhn 20:23.\x*\wj I’ve give you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you restrain on the earth will be restrained in the heavens, and whatever you free on the earth, will be freed in the heavens.\wj*”
\p
\v 20 Then he instructed his apprentices not to tell anyone that he is the \nd messiah\nd*.
\s1 Yeshua talks about future suffering and death
\r (Mark 8:31–9:1; Luke 9:22-27)
\p
\v 21 From that time onwards, \nd Yeshua\nd* began showing his apprentices that he needed to go to Yerushalem and to suffer at the hands of the elders and chief priests and teachers of the law there, before being executed and then coming back to life on the third day.
\p
\v 22 But Peter took him aside and started telling him off, saying, “Goodness gracious, \nd master\nd*, this certainly won’t happen to you.”
\p
\v 23 Yeshua turned towards Peter and said, “\wj Get behind me, Satan. You’re tempting me because you not thinking in a godly way, but only in human terms.\wj*”
\p
\v 24 \x + \xo 16:24: \xt Mat 10:38; Luk 14:27.\x*Then \nd Yeshua\nd* told his apprentices, “\wj If anyone wants to be my follower, they need to suppress their own desires and be ready to sacrifice and to suffer, and then follow me.\wj*
\v 25 \x + \xo 16:25: \xt Mat 10:39; Luk 17:33; Yhn 12:25.\x*\wj Because anyone who wants to save their life will lose it, but anyone who loses their life on my account, will be finding it.\wj*
\v 26 \wj What help would it be to a person if they gain everything in the world, and yet lose their soul? Or \+add put another way\+add*, what could a person give in exchange for their soul?\wj*
\v 27 \x + \xo 16:27: a \xt Mat 25:31; \xo b \xt Psa 62:12; Rom 2:6.\x*\wj Because humanity’s child is going to return displaying the splendour of his father and accompanied by his messengers, and then he’ll reward each individual according to their behaviour.\wj*
\v 28 \wj I can assure you that some people standing here won’t experience death until they first see humanity’s child coming in his kingdom.\wj*”
\c 17
\s1 Yeshua’s face shines brightly
\r (Mark 9:2-13; Luke 9:28-36)
\p
\v 1 After six days, \nd Yeshua\nd* took Peter, and Yacob and his brother Yohan, and they went up a high hill by themselves,
\v 2 and Yeshua was changed in front of them so that his face shone like the sun and his clothes became as white as the light.
\v 3 Then look, Mosheh and Eliyyah appeared and they could see them talking with Yeshua.
\v 4 Then Peter spoke up and said to \nd Yeshua\nd*, “\nd Master\nd*, it’s good that we’re here. If you want, I could make three shelters here: one for you and one for Mosheh and one for Eliyyah.”
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 17:5: a \xt Gen 22:2; Psa 2:7; Isa 42:1; Mat 3:17; 12:18; Mrk 1:11; Luk 3:22; \xo b \xt Deu 18:15.\x*While he was still speaking, a bright cloud came over the top of them and wow, a voice came out of the cloud saying, “This is my dear son that I get great pleasure from. Just listen to him.”
\p
\v 6 When the \add three\add* apprentices heard the voice, they lay face down and were extremely scared.
\v 7 But \nd Yeshua\nd* went across to them, and touching them he said, “\wj Get up now and don’t be afraid,\wj*”
\v 8 and when they looked around, they didn’t see anyone other than \nd Yeshua\nd* himself.
\p
\v 9 As they started heading down the hill, \nd Yeshua\nd* instructed them, “\wj Don’t tell anyone what you saw until after humanity’s child comes back to life.\wj*”
\p
\v 10 \x + \xo 17:10: \xt Mal 4:5.\x*So his apprentices asked him, “Why do the religious teachers say that Eliyyah has to come \add before the messiah\add*?”
\p
\v 11 “\wj In a way, Eliyyah is coming\wj*” he said, “\wj and he will restore everything.\wj*
\v 12 \x + \xo 17:12: \xt Mat 11:14.\x*\wj But I’m also telling you that in another way, Eliyyah already came and they didn’t recognise him, but they \+add mistreated\+add* him just however they wanted, and humanity’s child will suffer from their actions like that too.\wj*”
\p
\v 13 Then the apprentices realised that he was talking to them about Yohan-the-immerser.
\s1 Yeshua drives a demon out of a boy
\r (Mark 9:14-29; Luke 9:37-43a)
\p
\v 14 When they got back to the crowd, a man approached Yeshua and knelt down before him
\v 15 saying, “\nd Master\nd*, show mercy to my son, because he has seizures and isn’t well, often falling into the fire or the water.
\v 16 I brought him to your apprentices, but they weren’t able to heal him.”
\p
\v 17 “\wj Oh you unbelieving and depraved generation,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj how much longer will I have to be with you all? How much longer can I tolerate you all? Bring your son here to me.\wj*”
\v 18 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* rebuked the demon and it came out of him, and the boy was healed that very hour.
\p
\v 19 Later the apprentices went by themselves to \nd Yeshua\nd* and asked him how come they hadn’t been able to drive away the demon.
\p

\p
\v 24 \x + \xo 17:24: \xt Exo 30:13; 38:26.\x*Then when they got to Capernaum, the tax-collectors collecting the poll tax approached Peter and asked him, “Isn’t your teacher going to pay the tax?”
\p
\v 25 “Yes, he will.” replied Peter.
\p Then when he went inside the house, before he could say anything \nd Yeshua\nd* asked him, “\wj What do you think, Simon? Do earthly kings extract taxes from their own children, or from strangers?\wj*”
\p
\v 26 “From strangers,” answered Peter.
\p “\wj So surely the children are exempt?\wj*”, \nd Yeshua\nd* responded,
\v 27 “\wj but so that we don’t offend them, go down to the lake and throw in a line. Pull out the first fish that you hook, and when you open its mouth, you’ll find a coin that’ll be enough to pay the tax for both of us.\wj*”

\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 18:1: \xt Luk 22:24.\x*Around that time his apprentices approached \nd Yeshua\nd* and asked him, “So who will be the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?”

\v 2 Yeshua called in a small child and stood the child in the middle of the room
\v 3 \x + \xo 18:3: \xt Mrk 10:15; Luk 18:17.\x*and said, “\wj I can assure you all that if you don’t turn and become like a small child, you all certainly won’t enter the kingdom of the heavens,\wj*
\v 4 \wj so anyone who humbles themself like this small child is greater in the kingdom of the heavens.\wj*
\v 5 \wj Anyone who receives a small child like this in my name, is receiving me,\wj*
\p
\v 6 “\wj But anyone who causes one of these small ones who believe in me to stumble, it would have been better for that person if a heavy stone had been hung around their neck and if they’d been sunk in the deep lake.\wj*
\v 7 \wj The world suffers due to temptations, because it’s necessary for temptations to come, but it won’t be good for the person who brings the temptation.\wj*
\p
\v 8 \x + \xo 18:8: \xt Mat 5:30.\x*“\wj If your hand or foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away because it’s better for you to enter \+add eternal\+add* life maimed or lame than to be thrown into the eternal fire with two hands and feet.\wj*
\v 9 \x + \xo 18:9: \xt Mat 5:29.\x*\wj Also if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw it away because it’s better for you to enter \+add eternal\+add* life with only one eye than to be thrown into the pit of fire with two eyes.\wj*
\s1 Finding the lost sheep
\r (Luke 15:3-7)
\p
\v 10 “\wj Make sure that you all don’t despise any of these small ones, because I’m telling you all that their messengers in the heavens are always in front of my father who is in the heavens.\wj*
\p
\v 11 ◘\f + \fr 18:11 \ft Some Greek manuscripts add in the text of Luke 19:10 here: because humanity’s child came to look for those who are lost, and save them.\f*
\v 12 “\wj What do you think about this: a man had a hundred sheep and one of them strayed away. Won’t he leave the ninety-nine there in the hills and go and look for the sheep that was missing?\wj*
\v 13 \wj And if he happens to find it, I can assure you that he’ll be happier about that one than about the ninety-nine who never strayed away.\wj*
\v 14 \wj In the same way, your father in the heavens doesn’t want \+add even\+add* one of these small ones to perish.\wj*
\s1 Confronting an offender
\p
\v 15 \x + \xo 18:15: \xt Luk 17:3.\x*“\wj If a fellow believer sins, go where there’s just the two of you and rebuke that person privately. If they listen to you, you have gained \+add back\+add* a fellow believer.\wj*

\s1 The importance of forgiveness
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 18:21-22: \xt Luk 17:3-4.\x*Then Peter approached Yeshua and asked, “\nd Master\nd*, how often can someone sin against me and I’ll still have to forgive them?”

\v 22 \x + \xo 18:22: \xt Gen 4:24.\x*“\wj I won’t say seven times,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj but seventy times seven times!\wj*
\p
\v 23 “\wj It’s because of this that the kingdom of the heavens can be likened to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his slaves.\wj*
\v 24 \wj So when he began the process, a man was brought in who owed him millions,\wj*
\v 25 \wj but since he had no way of repaying it, the master commanded for him and his wife and children and all their possessions to be sold to help pay off the debt.\wj*
\v 26 \wj Then that slave dropped to the ground and prostrated himself to the master, saying, ‘Master, give me a little more time and then I’ll be able to repay it all to you.’\wj*
\v 27 \wj So the master felt sorry for that slave and sent him away and forgave his loan.\wj*
\p
\v 28 “\wj But when the slave got outside, he found one of his fellow-slaves who owed him a few thousand. He grabbed him and was strangling him with his hands saying, ‘Give back what you owe!’\wj*
\v 29 \wj The fellow slave dropped to the ground and begged him, ‘Give me a little more time and I’ll repay you.’\wj*
\v 30 \wj But the other wasn’t willing, and he went and had the man thrown into prison until he repaid what he owed.\wj*
\v 31 \wj The other slaves who had observed all this were very upset, so they went and informed the master about what had happened.\wj*
\v 32 \wj So then the master called in \+add the slave that he had forgiven\+add* and told him, ‘You evil slave! I forgave you all that obligation because you pleaded with me.\wj*
\v 33 \wj Wouldn’t it have been reasonable for you also to have shown mercy to your fellow-slave just like I was merciful to you?’\wj*
\v 34 \wj Now the master who was now quite angry, handed him over to the torturers until he could repay everything that he owed.\wj*
\p
\v 35 “\wj So that’s how my heavenly father will treat you if you don’t genuinely forgive others around you.\wj*”

\p
\v 1 When \nd Yeshua\nd* had finished these messages, he left Galilee and went to the Yudean regions on the other side of the Yordan River
\v 2 and large crowds followed him, and he healed them.
\p
\v 3 Some from the Pharisees’ party approached him to test him by asking, “Is there any cause for which a man can dismiss his wife?”
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 19:4: \xt Gen 1:27; 5:2.\x*“\wj Haven’t you read,\wj*” he replied, “\wj that \+add God\+add* made them male and female from the beginning?\wj*

\v 7 \x + \xo 19:7: \xt Deu 24:1-4; Mat 5:31.\x*“So why did Mosheh allow us to give her a letter of divorce and then to send her away?” they asked him.
\p
\v 8 “\wj It was because of your hard hearts that Mosheh allowed you to send away your wife,\wj*” Yeshua answered, “\wj but it wasn’t like that at the beginning.\wj*
\v 9 \x + \xo 19:9: \xt Mat 5:32; 1Cor 7:10-11.\x*\wj Now I’m telling you that anyone who sends away his wife because of sexual immorality and then remarries, is \+add also\+add* causing adultery. Also the woman who was sent away if she remarries, she causes adultery.\wj*
\p
\v 10 His followers made the point, “If that’s the case for husband and wife, it’s better not to get married.”
\p
\v 11 “\wj Not everyone can accept this,\wj*” Yeshua responded, “\wj but only those with a special gift.\wj*
\v 12 \wj Because there are some men who are born from their mother’s womb without testicles, there are some who’ve been castrated by others, and there are some who castrate themselves because of the kingdom of the heavens. Anyone who is able to accept this can accept it.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua blesses the children
\r (Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17)
\p
\v 13 Then some small children were brought to Yeshua hoping that he would place his hands on them and pray for them, but the apprentices scolded them.
\v 14 But \nd Yeshua\nd* intervened, “\wj Be patient with the children and don’t stop them from coming to me, because it’s ones like these that make up the kingdom of the heavens.\wj*”
\p
\v 15 Then after placing his hands on them, he left that place.
\s1 Answering the rich man
\r (Mark 10:17-31; Luke 18:18-30)
\p
\v 16 And look, a man approached Yeshua and asked him, “Teacher, what good thing do I need to do in order to have eternal life?”
\p
\v 17 “\wj Why are you asking me about what’s good?\wj*” Yeshua responded. “\wj \+add Only\+add* one is good. But if you’re wanting to enter into life, you should obey \+add God’s\+add* commands.\wj*”

\v 21 “\wj If you want to be perfect,\wj*” answered \nd Yeshua\nd*, “\wj go and sell what you own and give to the poor, and then you’ll have treasure in the heavens. Then come and follow me.\wj*”
\p
\v 22 But when the young man heard that, he went away despondent because he owned many properties.
\p
\v 23 So \nd Yeshua\nd* said to his apprentices, “\wj I can assure you that it’s \+add more\+add* difficult for a wealthy person to enter the kingdom of the heavens.\wj*
\v 24 \wj In fact, it’s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a wealthy person to enter God’s kingdom.\wj*”
\p
\v 25 When his apprentices heard that, they were very surprised and asked, “Well, who can be saved then?”
\p
\v 26 \nd Yeshua\nd* looked them in the eyes and answered, “\wj It’s impossible for humans, but with \+nd God\+nd*, everything is possible.\wj*”

\v 27 “Hey,” Peter reacted, “we left everything to follow you, so what will happen to us?”

\v 28 \x + \xo 19:28: a \xt Mat 25:31; \xo b \xt Luk 22:30.\x*“\wj I can assure you all,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* responded. “\wj that after \+add the world\+add* is remade and I sit down on his splendid throne, all of you who followed me will also sit on twelve thrones ruling over the twelve tribes of Yisrael.\wj*

\v 6 \wj When he came out around 5pm and there were still people just standing around, he asked them, ‘Why have you been idly standing here all day?’\wj*

\p
\v 21 “\wj What is it that you’re wanting?\wj*” Yeshua asked.
\p “Promise that my two sons will be able to sit beside you in the kingdom,” she said, “one on the right and one on the left.”
\p
\v 22 But \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj You all don’t realise what you’re asking. Do you think you’ll be able to bear the suffering that I will have to suffer?\wj*”
\p “Yes,” they replied, “we can.”
\p
\v 23 “\wj Well, you will indeed share the suffering with me,\wj*” Yeshua responded. “\wj But on the other hand, sitting on my right and my left is not my decision to make, because my father will have prepared those places.\wj*”
\p
\v 24 Now the other ten who’d heard all this, took offence at the two brothers

\v 25 \wj So, where did Yohan’s practice of immersion come from?\wj*”
\p They discussed this among themselves, saying, “If we say from heaven, he’ll ask us why we didn’t believe Yohan.
\v 26 But if we say it was a human idea, then the crowd might revolt against us because they consider Yohan to be a prophet.”

\s1 The parable about the wedding reception
\r (Luke 14:15-24)
\p
\v 1 \nd Yeshua\nd*, still answering them, told another parable:
\v 2 “\wj The kingdom of the heavens is like a king who prepared the wedding reception for his son\wj*
\v 3 \wj and he sent out some of his slaves to remind those who’d been invited, but they didn’t want to come.\wj*
\v 4 \wj So he sent out some other slaves, instructing them, ‘Tell those who are invited: Listen, I’ve prepared the dinner, including some of my grain-fed beef and everything’s now ready. Come to the wedding and celebrate.’\wj*
\v 5 \wj But they ignored the message and went their various ways—one went off to his field \+add to work\+add* and another went into his business.\wj*
\v 6 \wj Still others grabbed the slaves and mistreated them, and even killed them.\wj*
\p
\v 7 “\wj Now the king was angry and sent in his soldiers to destroy those murderers and to burn their city.\wj*
\v 8 \wj Then he told his slaves, ‘Well, the wedding reception is ready but those that were invited aren’t worthy to come.\wj*
\v 9 \wj So spread out on the roads and invite everywhere that you find to come to the reception.’\wj*
\v 10 \wj So those slaves went out onto the roads and invited everyone they found—both evil and good people, and then the seats at the wedding reception were all full.\wj*
\p
\v 11 “\wj But when the king came into to meet the seated guests, he saw a man there who wasn’t dressed in the proper clothes for a wedding,\wj*
\v 12 \wj and demanded, ‘Friend, how did you get in here without the right clothes?’ But the man had nothing to say.\wj*
\v 13 \x + \xo 22:13: \xt Mat 8:12; 25:30; Luk 13:28.\x*\wj So the king told his servants, ‘Tie up the man’s hands and feet and throw him outside into the darkness, and there’ll be weeping and much anguish \+add out there\+add*.’\wj*
\p
\v 14 \wj Because many are invited, but few are selected.\wj*”
\s1 The question about paying tax
\r (Mark 12:13-17; Luke 20:20-26)
\p
\v 15 Then the \add members of\add* the Pharisees went away and had a discussion to try to figure out how to trap him into saying something wrong.
\v 16 Afterwards, they sent some of their apprentices along with some supporters of Herod and asked, “Teacher, we know that you are honest and that you teach God’s ways in all honesty irrespective of what people might say, because you don’t care about people’s opinions.
\v 17 So then, tell us what you think: should we pay the poll tax to Caesar or not?”
\p
\v 18 But \nd Yeshua\nd* knew how wicked they were and asked, “\wj Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?\wj*
\v 19 \wj Show me the coin used to pay the poll tax.\wj*” So they brought a coin to him.
\v 20 Then he asked, “\wj Whose image is this on the coin, and the inscription?\wj*”
\p
\v 21 “Caesar’s,” they answered.
\p “\wj Then give Caesar’s things to Caesar and God’s things to God,\wj*” Yeshua responded.
\p
\v 22 When they heard that, they were amazed, and left him and went away.

\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 22:23: \xt Acts 23:8.\x*On that day some from the Sadducee sect (who claim there’s no resurrection) approached Yeshua and asked,
\v 24 \x + \xo 22:24: \xt Deu 25:5.\x*“Teacher, Mosheh wrote that if a married man dies childless, his brother should marry the widow and so raise up children for his deceased brother.
\v 25 Well, there were seven brothers amongst up, and the first one got married and then died childless. So his brother married the widow.
\v 26 The same happened for the second brother, and the third, all the way to the seventh.
\v 27 Finally the woman died.
\v 28 Now then, in the resurrection, which of the brothers will she be the wife of, because they were all married to her?”
\p
\v 29 “\wj You’ve got it wrong,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj because you don’t understand either the scriptures or God’s power,\wj*
\v 30 \wj because in the resurrection, there’ll be no marrying or getting engaged, because they’ll be like the messengers in heaven.\wj*
\v 31 \wj But as for the resurrection of the dead, isn’t it \+add written in the scriptures\+add* that \+nd God\+nd* said,\wj*
\v 32 \x + \xo 22:32: \xt Exo 3:6.\x*\wj ‘\+em I am\+em* Abraham’s God and Isaac’s God and Yacob’s God.’? So God is not the god of the dead, but of the living.\wj*”
\p
\v 33 When the crowds heard his answer, they were amazed at his teaching.
\s1 The most important command
\r (Mark 12:28-34; Luke 10:25-28)
\p
\v 34 But when the Pharisees party heard that Yeshua had silenced the Sadducees, they decided to work together,
\v 35 so a lawyer among them tested him by asking,
\v 36 “Teacher, which is the most important command from Mosheh?”
\p
\v 37 \x + \xo 22:37: \xt Deu 6:5.\x*“\wj You should love your \+nd God Yahweh\+nd* with all your heart and your soul and your mind.\wj*

\r (Mark 12:35-37; Luke 20:41-44)
\p
\v 41 Since all from the Pharisees’ party were gathered together, \nd Yeshua\nd* asked them a question,
\v 42 “\wj How do you \+add interpret the scriptures\+add* about the \+nd messiah\+nd*? Who will he be a descendant of?\wj*”
\p “A descendant of \add King\add* David,” they answered.
\p
\v 43 “\wj Then how could David,\wj*” he continued, “\wj under the \+add inspiration of God’s\+add* \+nd spirit\+nd*, call him ‘\+nd master\+nd*’ when he said,\wj*
\q1

\q1 \wj until I conquer your enemies.”\wj*
\m
\v 45 \wj So if David is calling him ‘\+nd master\+nd*’, how could he be his descendant?\wj*”
\p
\v 46 No one was able to answer his question, and after that day they didn’t dare ask him anything else.

\p
\v 3 At that time, the chief priests and the local elders were gathered together in the courtyard of Caiaphas, the chief priest,
\v 4 and they plotted together to devise a way to arrest \nd Yeshua\nd* so they could execute him.
\v 5 However, they decided not to do it during the celebrations so it wouldn’t cause a big public disturbance.
\s1 Yeshua is anointed with lotion
\r (Mark 14:3-9; Yhn 12:1-8)

\v 9 That could have been sold and raised a lot of money to give to the poor.”
\p
\v 10 But \nd Yeshua\nd* knew what they were saying and responded, “\wj Why are you all causing problems for this woman, because she did something beautiful for me.\wj*
\v 11 \x + \xo 26:11: \xt Deu 15:11.\x*\wj You’ll always have the poor with you, but you won’t always have me \+add around\+add*.\wj*

\s1 Yudas agrees to turn in Yeshua

\s1 Yeshua gets ready to celebrate Passover

\p
\v 17 On the first day of the \it Flat Bread Celebration\it*, the \nd Yeshua’s\nd* apprentices approached him and asked, “Where do you want us to prepare the passover meal for you?”
\p
\v 18 “\wj Go into the city to so-and-so,\wj*” answered Yeshua, “\wj and tell him that the teacher said, ‘My time is getting close, but I’ll celebrate the passover meal with you, along with my apprentices.’\wj* ”
\p
\v 19 So the apprentices did as \nd Yeshua\nd* had instructed them, and then they prepared the passover meal.
\p
\v 20 That evening as Yeshua was sitting with the twelve,
\v 21 he said to them while they were still eating, “\wj I can assure you that one of you is going to turn me in.\wj*”
\p
\v 22 They were very upset and one by one they asked him, “Surely it won’t be me, \nd master\nd*?”

\v 24 \wj It’s true that humanity’s child is going \+add to suffer\+add* what has already been written about, but on the other hand, the end won’t be good for the man who turns him in, in fact it would have been better for him if he’d never been born.\wj*”

\s1 Yeshua shares the bread and the wine
\r (Mark 14:22-26; Luke 22:14-20; 1 Cor. 11:23-25)
\p
\v 26 Then during the meal, \nd Yeshua\nd* took some bread and blessed \add it\add*, then he broke it into pieces and gave it to his apprentices, saying, “\wj Take this and eat it—it’s my body.\wj*”
\p
\v 27 Then he took a cup \add of wine\add* and after giving thanks, he shared it with them saying, “\wj Everyone drink some,\wj*
\v 28 \x + \xo 26:28: a \xt Exo 24:8; \xo b \xt Jer 31:31-34.\x*\wj because this is my blood of the agreement which is \+add about to\+add* be poured out for the forgiveness of the sins of many people.\wj*
\v 29 \wj I can assure you all that I certainly won’t drink this \+add passover\+add* wine again until I’m able to drink it together with you all in my father’s kingdom.\wj*”
\p
\v 30 Then they sang some songs before heading out of the city to the Mount of Olives.
\s1 Yeshua predicts Peter’s denials
\r (Mark 14:27-31; Luke 22:31-34; Yhn 13:36-38)
\p
\v 31 \x + \xo 26:31: \xt Zech 13:7.\x*Then \nd Yeshua\nd* told them, “\wj All of you will flounder tonight concerning me, because it’s been written, ‘I’ll strike the shepherd and the flock will be scattered.’\wj*

\p
\v 33 “Even if all the others flounder,” answered Peter, “I won’t.”

\v 34 “\wj I can assure you,\wj*” responded \nd Yeshua\nd*, “\wj that you’ll disown me three times tonight before the rooster crows \+add in the morning\+add*.\wj*”

\v 35 “Even if I have to die with you,” said Peter, “I’d certainly never disown you,” and all the other apprentices said likewise.
\s1 Yeshua prays at Gethsemane
\r (Mark 14:32-42; Luke 22:39-46)
\p
\v 36 Then they went together to a property named Gethsemane where he told his apprentices to sit down while he went on a little further to pray.
\v 37 He took Peter, Yacob, and Yohan with him, and then he was struck by feelings of sorrow and distress
\v 38 and told them, “\wj My soul is deathly sad. Stay here and look out for me.\wj*”
\p
\v 39 He went on a little further, and knelt with his face to the ground, saying, “\wj My father, if it’s possible, let me avoid this suffering. However, it’s not what I want because I want to do what \+em you\+em* want.\wj*”
\p
\v 40 Then he went back to the apprentices, but found them napping and said to Peter, “\wj Weren’t you even able to stay awake for an hour for me?\wj*
\v 41 \wj Stay alert and pray so that you all don’t fall into temptation. Your spirits are eager, but your endurance is lacking.\wj*”
\p
\v 42 Then he went off a second time and prayed, “\wj My father, if this can’t be done any other way than me having to suffer, then I’ll submit to your will.\wj*”
\v 43 Returning again, he found the apprentices sleeping because they were very tired.
\p
\v 44 So he left them there and went back a third time, praying in the same way.
\v 45 Then he went back to his apprentices and told them, “\wj You’re all sleeping to get some rest? But look, it’s time now, and humanity’s child is about to be handed over to sinners.\wj*
\v 46 \wj Get up—we need to move. The one about to turn me in is coming.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua is arrested
\r (Mark 14:43-50; Luke 22:47-53; Yhn 18:3-12)
\p
\v 47 While he was still speaking, Yudas, one of the twelve, came and he was accompanied by a large crowd from the chief priests and local elders, and they were carrying swords and clubs.
\v 48 The one who was turning him in had prearranged a sign that he would kiss the one that they should arrest.
\p
\v 49 He walked straight up to \nd Yeshua\nd* and said, “Greetings, my honoured teacher,” and he kissed him.
\p
\v 50 “\wj Friend,\wj*” Yeshua asked, “\wj why have you come?\wj*”
\p Then they came up to Yeshua, and grabbed and arrested him.
\v 51 But wow, one of \nd Yeshua’s\nd* group put out a hand \add to stop them\add*, then drew his sword and struck at the chief priest’s slave, cutting off his ear.
\v 52 “\wj Put your sword back in its sheath,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* said, “\wj because those who fight with the sword, die by the sword.\wj*
\v 53 \wj Don’t you realise that I could just ask my father and he would place over a dozen divisions of heavenly soldiers here in front of me,\wj*
\v 54 \wj however then the scriptures that tell what will happen wouldn’t get fulfilled.\wj*”
\p
\v 55 \x + \xo 26:55: \xt Luk 19:47; 21:37.\x*Then turning to the crowds, \nd Yeshua\nd* said, “\wj So you all came out with swords and clubs as if you were arresting a thief?\wj*
\v 56 \wj I was sitting, teaching every day in the temple but you didn’t arrest me there.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua is interrogated by the Jewish leaders
\r (Mark 14:53-65; Luke 22:54-55,63-71; Yhn 18:13-14,19-24)
\p
\v 57 Then the ones who had arrested \nd Yeshua\nd* led him away to Caiaphas the chief priest, where the religious teachers and the \add local\add* elders had gathered together.
\v 58 Peter followed along from a distance, and went inside to the chief priest’s courtyard, where he sat with the attendants and waited to see what would happen.
\v 59 The chief priests and the whole council tried to find people who would bring false accusations against \nd Yeshua\nd* so they could sentence him to death,
\v 60 but even though many people wanted to try, they couldn’t find anyone suitable. Eventually, two others came up
\v 61 \x + \xo 26:61: \xt Yhn 2:19.\x*and said, “We heard this man say, ‘I’m able to demolish God’s temple and rebuild it in three days.’ ”
\p
\v 62 So the chief priest stood and asked Yeshua, “Don’t you have any respond to what these men are accusing you of?”
\v 63 But \nd Yeshua\nd* stayed silent, so then the chief priest asked him, “I order you by the living God to tell us if you’re the \nd messiah\nd*, the son of God.”
\p
\v 64 \x + \xo 26:64: \xt Dan 7:13.\x*“\wj You said it,\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* responded. “\wj However, I can tell you all that from now on, you’ll see humanity’s child sitting beside God in the position of power and coming in the clouds in the sky.\wj*”
\p
\v 65 \x + \xo 26:65-66: \xt Lev 24:16.\x*Then the chief priest tore his robes and said, “He belittled \add God\add*. Why would we need more witnesses after that? See here, you all heard him slander \add God\add*.
\v 66 What do you all think now?
\p “He should get the death penalty,” they answered.
\p
\v 67 \x + \xo 26:67: \xt Isa 50:6.\x*Then they spat in Yeshua’s face and they beat him and slapped him
\v 68 saying, “Prophesy to us, \nd messiah\nd*. Who was it that just slapped you?”
\s1 Peter disowns Yeshua
\r (Mark 14:66-72; Luke 22:56-62; Yhn 18:15-18,25-27)
\p
\v 69 Meanwhile Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard when a servant girl went up to him and said, “You were one of the ones with \nd Yeshua\nd* from Galilee.”
\p
\v 70 But Peter disowned Yeshua in front of them all saying, “I’ve got no idea what you’re talking about.”
\v 71 Then he went out the gate, but someone else saw him and she told the others, “This man was with \nd Yeshua\nd* from \nd Nazareth\nd*.”
\p
\v 72 Again, Peter disowned Yeshua with an oath, “I don’t even know the guy.”
\p
\v 73 A little while later, another person stood up and went to Peter, “You must be one of them because we can tell by your accent.”
\p
\v 74 Peter began to curse and promise, “I don’t know that man.” Just then the rooster crowed
\v 75 and then Peter remembered that \nd Yeshua\nd* had said that he would deny him three times before the rooster crowed. He left the courtyard and went away and bawled in shame.

\p “What’s that got to do with us?” they asked. “You sort out \add your own problems\add*.”
\p
\v 5 Then Yudas threw the money down on the temple \add floor\add* and went off and hanged himself.
\p
\v 6 The chief priests took the money and decided, “We can’t legally deposit the money to the temple treasury because it’s blood money.”
\v 7 They got advice and decided to buy the potter’s field \add that was for sale\add* to make it a cemetery for people from out of town,
\v 8 so that place got called ‘The field of blood’ until today.
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 27:9-10: \xt Zech 11:12-13.\x*And so the message which had been \add written\add* by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, ‘They took the thirty silver coins, the price of the one who was sold, the price set by the Israelis,

\v 11 Meanwhile Yeshua was stood in front of the governor and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
\p “\wj You said it,\wj*”, responded Yeshua,
\v 12 but when he chief priests and the elders brought their accusations against him, he didn’t say anything.
\p
\v 13 Then Pilate asked him, “Can’t you hear all the evidence against you that they’re listing?”
\p
\v 14 But he didn’t respond, not even a single word, and this greatly surprised the governor.
\s1 The guiltless Yeshua is sentenced to death
\r (Mark 15:6-15; Luke 23:13-25; Yhn 18:39–19:16)
\p
\v 15 It was the time of the Passover celebrations, and a tradition had been established that the governor would release one prisoner to the people—whoever they chose.
\v 16 At that time, there was a well-known prisoner named Barabbas,
\v 17 so when all the people had gathered, Pilate shouted down to them, “Who would you all like me to release: Barabbas or \nd Yeshua\nd* who’s also being called the \nd messiah\nd*?”
\v 18 He \add said this\add* because he knew that Yeshua had been arrested because of the jealousy \add of the Jewish leaders\add*.
\p
\v 19 But while Pilate was still making his judgement, his wife sent a note to him, saying, “Don’t touch that guiltless man because I was very distressed by a dream I had about him.”
\p
\v 20 Meanwhile the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds to request that Barabbas be released and that \nd Yeshua\nd* should be sentenced,
\v 21 so when the governor asked them, “Which of these two men should I release?” they called back, “Barabbas.”
\p
\v 22 “So what should I do to \nd Yeshua\nd* who’s called the \nd messiah\nd*?” Pilate asked.
\p “Execute him on a stake!” they all responded.
\p
\v 23 “But what crime has he done?” demanded Pilate.
\p But they just kept yelling loudly, “Execute him on a stake.”
\p
\v 24 \x + \xo 27:24: \xt Deu 21:6-9.\x*When Pilate saw that it was going nowhere other than to turn into a riot, got \add a bowl of\add* water and washed his hands \add up there\add* in front of the crowd, announcing, “I’m innocent of the blood of this man who has done nothing wrong. It’s your responsibility now.”
\p
\v 25 “\add The responsibility for\add* his blood will be on us and on our children,” the people shouted back.
\p
\v 26 Then Pilate commanded that Barabbas be released. He commanded that \nd Yeshua\nd* be flogged and then he handed him over to be executed.
\s1 ‘King’ Yeshua is mocked by the soldiers
\r (Mark 15:16-20; Yhn 19:2-3)
\p
\v 27 The governor’s soldiers took \nd Yeshua\nd* to \add the courtyard of\add* his residence and called together all the soldiers in the unit.
\v 28 Then they stripped Yeshua and placed a \add royal\add* scarlet robe around him.
\v 29 They twisted together a crown made of \add strips of\add* thorns and plonked it on his head and made him hold a reed as a staff. Then they knelt down in front of him and mocked him, saying, “Greetings, \add your majesty,\add* King of the Jews.”
\v 30 They spat on him then snatched the reed away and used it to whack him on the head.
\v 31 When they’d finished mocking him, they took the robe off him and dressed him in his own clothes again before they led him away to the place where he’d be executed.
\s1 Yeshua and robbers placed on stakes

\p
\v 41 Similarly, the chief priests and the religious teachers and the elders mocked him saying,
\v 42 “Ha, he saved others but he can’t even save himself. If he’s Yisrael’s king, let him come down now from the stake and then we’ll believe in him.

\v 48 \x + \xo 27:48: \xt Psa 69:21.\x*One of them ran and got a sponge and dipped it in wine vinegar, and then wrapped it around a reed and held it up to his mouth to drink from.
\p
\v 49 But the others were saying, “Just leave him and we’ll see whether Eliyyah comes to save him.”
\p
\v 50 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* made a loud cry and sent his spirit away.
\p
\v 51 \x + \xo 27:51: \xt Exo 26:31-33.\x*Then, wow, the curtain inside the temple was torn apart from the top to the bottom, and there was an earthquake and splitting of rocks.
\v 52 Some tombs came open and many bodies of godly people came alive again
\v 53 and leaving the tombs after his resurrection, they went into God’s city where many people saw them.
\p
\v 54 The \add Roman\add* officer and his soldiers who were guarding \nd Yeshua\nd* were very frightened when they felt the earthquake and saw what happened, and said, “This man really was a son of \nd God\nd*!”
\p
\v 55 \x + \xo 27:55-56: \xt Luk 8:2-3.\x*There were many women watching all this from a distance—they were those who from Galilee who had followed \nd Yeshua\nd* and looked \nd after\nd* him,
\v 56 including Maria from Magdala, Maria the mother of Yacob and Yosef, and Zebedee’s wife—the mother of Yacob and Yohan.
\s1 Yeshua’s body is placed in a tomb
\r (Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-56; Yhn 19:38-42)
\p
\v 57 As it moved into evening, a wealthy man named Yosef from Arimathea came—he’d also been one of \nd Yeshua’s\nd* apprentices.
\v 58 He went to Pilate and requested \nd Yeshua’s\nd* body, and Pilate commanded the soldiers to release it.
\v 59 Yosef took the body and wrapped it in clean, linen cloth
\v 60 and put it in his own tomb which had been newly carved into the rock. Then he rolled a big stone into the door of the tomb and left it.
\v 61 Maria from Magdala and the other Maria sat there in front of the tomb.
\s1 Guards are assigned to the tomb
\p
\v 62 The next day was the day after the Passover preparation day and the chief priests and the Pharisees went together to Pilate
\v 63 \x + \xo 27:63: \xt Mat 16:21; 17:23; 20:19; Mrk 8:31; 9:31; 10:33-34; Luk 9:22; 18:31-33.\x*and told him, “Master, we were reminded that that deceiver when he was still alive said that he would come back to life after three days
\v 64 so you should command that the tomb be secured until the third day in case someone steals his body and then tells the people that he has come alive again—that would be a worse deception than his initial \add teachings\add*.”
\p
\v 65 “Well you all guard it,” answered Pilate, “and keep it secure as you say.”
\p
\v 66 So they went and secured the tomb by sealing it and placing guards there.

\s1 The women encounter the messenger and then meet Yeshua
\r (Mark 16:1-10; Luke 24:1-12; Yhn 20:1-10)
\p
\v 1 After the days of rest during the first light of Sunday morning, Maria from Magdala and the other Maria went out to visit the tomb.
\v 2 Then, wow, there was a massive earthquake because one of \nd Yahweh’s\nd* messengers had come down from heaven and approached the tomb. He had rolled away the stone and was now sitting on it.
\v 3 He looked as if you were watching lightning and his clothes were extremely white.
\v 4 The guards \add at the tomb\add* shook with fear when they saw him and then they fainted.
\p
\v 5 Then the messenger spoke to the women, “Don’t be scared because I know that both of you are looking for \nd Yeshua\nd* who was executed on a stake.
\v 6 He isn’t here, because he came back to life just like he said he would. Go inside and see the place where his \add body\add* was lying
\v 7 and then leave straight away and go and tell his followers that he has come alive again and will go ahead of you all to Galilee. You’ll see him when you get there. Listen, I’ve told you now.”
\p
\v 8 So they went off quickly with a mixture of fear and incredible happiness, and ran \add back\add* to tell Yeshua’s followers.
\p
\v 9 Then, wow, \nd Yeshua\nd* met them \add on the path\add* and greeted them. The two women went close \add and knelt down\add* and took hold of his feet and lowered their heads.
\v 10 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* spoke again, “\wj Don’t be scared. Go now and tell my brothers so they’ll go up to Galilee and then they’ll see me there.\wj*”
\s1 The guards are paid to lie
\p
\v 11 After they’d left, some of the guards \add from the tomb\add* went into the city and told the chief priests everything that had happened,
\v 12 so they met together with the elders and after some discussion, they gave a generous amount to the soldiers
\v 13 and told them, “Tell everyone that his followers came in the dark and stole his body when you had fallen asleep.
\v 14 If the governor hears about it, we’ll butter him up so that you won’t need to be afraid \add of getting punished\add*.”
\p
\v 15 So they took the money and did what they had been asked.
\s1 Yeshua commissions his apprentices as missionaries
\r (Mark 16:14-18; Luke 24:36-49; Yhn 20:19-23; Acts 1:6-8)
\p
\v 16 \x + \xo 28:16: \xt Mat 26:32; Mrk 14:28.\x*The eleven apprentices travelled up to Galilee to the hill that \nd Yeshua\nd* had \add previously\add* told them to go to,
\v 17 and when they saw him there, they immediately bowed down to the ground, even though their minds weren’t sure \add that it was really him\add*.
\v 18 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* came closer and told them, “\wj I have been given authority over both heavenly and earthly affairs\wj*
\v 19 \x + \xo 28:19: \xt Acts 1:8.\x*\wj so I want you to leave here and go and train followers in every country, immersing them \+add in water\+add* with the authority of the father and the son and the holy \+nd spirit\+nd*.\wj*
\v 20 \wj Then teach them to do everything just like I instructed all of you. And listen, I will be with you all every day right through until the end of \+add this\+add* age.\wj*”
