\p
\v 1 Any person who doesn’t take advice from wicked people,
\q2 and doesn’t stand by the path that sinners use,
\q2 and doesn’t sit and join all the scoffers,
\q2 will reap the benefits.
\q1
\v 2 \add On the contrary,\add* they enjoy Yahweh’s instructions
\q2 and think about them day and night.
\q1
\v 3 Those people are like trees that are planted by a stream\x + \xo 1:3: \xt Jer 17:8.\x*
\q2 and which produce fruit in season.
\q1 Their leaves don’t wither,
\q2 and they prosper in everything they do.

\q1 they’re like straw that gets blown away by the wind.
\q1
\v 5 The wicked \add people\add* won’t be able to stand when \add God\add* judges \add them\add*,
\q1 and sinners won’t be able to join in the assembly of \add all the godly people\add*.
\q1
\v 6 Because Yahweh knows the path \add chosen by godly people\add*,
\q1 but the path of wicked \add people\add* will be destroyed.

\v 3 \add saying,\add* “Let’s break their \add chains off us\add*.
\q1 Let’s throw off their ropes.”
\q1
\v 4 \add The one who\add* sits in the heavens laughs.

\q1
\v 5 Then he’ll speak to them in his anger,
\q1 and terrify them in his fury.

\s1 David’s song of victory

\d For the musical director: a song by Yahweh’s servant David, when he sang the words of this song to Yahweh on the day that Yahweh rescued him from Shaul \add (King Saul)\add* and all his \add other\add* enemies.
\q1
\v 1 He said:
\q1 I love you, Yahweh, my \add source of\add* strength.
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, \add the one who brings me to safety\add*.
\q1 He’s my God, my rock. I take refuge in him.
\q1 He’s my shield, the \add power that saves me\add*, my fortress.
\q1
\v 3 I will call \add for help from\add* Yahweh

\q1
\v 4 \add I felt like I was about to die\add*,
\q1 and torrents of worthlessness overwhelmed me.
\q1
\v 5 The \add grave seemed to be putting its ropes around\add* me.
\q1 The snares of death trapped me.
\q1
\v 6 In my distress I called out to Yahweh.
\q1 I cried for help to my God.
\q1 He heard my voice from his temple.
\q1 My call for help entered his presence.
\q1 It \add reached\add* his ears.
\q1
\v 7 Then the earth quaked and shook.
\q1 The foundations of the mountains trembled
\q1 and were shaken because \add God\add* \add was angry\add*.
\q1
\v 8 Smoke went up from out of his nostrils,
\q1 and blazing fire came out of his mouth.
\q1 Coals were ignited by it.
\q1
\v 9 He opened the skies and came down,
\q1 and \add heavy\add* darkness was under his feet.
\q1
\v 10 He rode on a winged creature and flew.
\q1 He glided on the wings of the wind.
\q1
\v 11 He made darkness \add into\add* a tent around him—
\q1 heavy rain clouds in the skies.
\q1
\v 12 Hail and \add burning\add* coals fell from the brightness in front of him.
\q1
\v 13 Yahweh thundered from the heavens.
\q1 The voice of the highest \add one\add* shouted.\f + \fr 18:13 \ft ‘hail and burning coals’ has been omitted from this translation as the Hebrew words are assumed to have been accidentally copied from the previous verse.\f*
\q1
\v 14 He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies—

\q1
\v 15 Then the water channels appeared.
\q1 The foundations of the world were exposed
\q2 at your rebuke, Yahweh—
\q1 at the blast of the breath from your nostrils.
\q1
\v 16 He reached down from above \add and\add* took hold of me.
\q1 He pulled me out of the surging waters.
\q1
\v 17 He rescued me from my powerful enemy—

\q1 because they were too strong for me.
\q1
\v 18 They confronted me \add when I was in\add* distress,
\q1 \add but\add* Yahweh was my support.
\q1
\v 19 He brought me out to a wide open place.

\v 20 Yahweh has rewarded me because \add I’ve done nothing wrong\add*.

\d \add A song\add* by David who pretended to be insane in front of \add King\add* Avimelek, \add causing the king to send him away\add*.
\q1
\v 1 I will praise Yahweh at all times.
\q1 \add I’ll always be praising him out loud\add*.
\q1
\v 2 I will praise Yahweh!
\q1 Let \add those who’re\add* oppressed hear and \add celebrate\add*.
\q1
\v 3 Praise Yahweh with me.
\q1 Let’s \add compliment him\add* together.
\q1
\v 4 I searched for Yahweh and he answered me,
\q1 and he \add helped me overcome\add* all my fears.
\q1
\v 5 Those who \add put their trust in\add* him are radiant,
\q1 and \add have no need to feel\add* ashamed.
\q1
\v 6 This oppressed man called out \add for help\add*
\q1 and Yahweh heard him and saved him from all his troubles.
\q1
\v 7 Yahweh’s messenger \add stands guard\add* around those who fear \add Yahweh\add*
\q1 and rescues them.
\q1
\v 8 Taste and see that Yahweh is good.
\q1 \add Anyone who looks to him for their safety will prosper\add*.
\q1
\v 9 Fear Yahweh, you \add who belong to him\add*.
\q1 There’s no lack for those who \add honour\add* him.
\q1
\v 10 Young lions sometimes lack food and \add go hungry\add*,
\q1 but those who \add put their trust in\add* Yahweh won’t lack anything good.
\q1
\v 11 Come \add and\add* listen to me, \add my\add* children.
\q1 I’ll teach you \add how to honour\add* Yahweh.
\q1
\v 12 \add Anyone\add* who desires life and \add wants a long life\add*
\q1 \add in order\add* \add to experience\add* good \add things\add*
\q1
\v 13 \add then\add* \add don’t let evil words come out of your mouth\add*,
\q1 and keep your lips from speaking lies.
\q1
\v 14 Turn away from evil
\q1 and do good.
\q1 Seek peace
\q1 and go after it.
\q1
\v 15 Yahweh’s eyes are on \add those who try to obey him\add*
\q1 and his ears are directed toward their calls \add for help\add*.
\q1
\v 16 Yahweh \add works against\add* those who do evil—
\q1 to cut off the memory of them from the earth.
\q1
\v 17 The \add godly\add* \add people\add* cry out and Yahweh hears
\q1 and he rescues them from all their troubles.
\q1
\v 18 Yahweh is close to the brokenhearted,
\q1 and he saves whose spirits \add feel\add* crushed.
\q1
\v 19 \add Godly people have many troubles\add*,
\q1 but Yahweh rescues them from them all.
\q1
\v 20 He keeps all his bones—
\q1 not one of them will be broken.
\q1
\v 21 Evil will \add bounce back and\add* kill the wicked.
\q1 and those who hate \add godly\add* \add people\add* will be condemned.
\q1
\v 22 Yahweh rescues the lives of his servants.
\q1 None of those who \add go to him for safety\add* will be condemned.
\c 35
\s1 Requesting Yahweh’s help
\d \add A song\add* by David.
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, work against those who work against me.
\q1 Fight against those who fight against me.
\q1
\v 2 Take hold of \add your\add* shield and \add your\add* \add arm protector\add*,
\q1 and come to help me.
\q1
\v 3 Use your spear and battle ax against those who chase me.
\q1 Tell my soul, “I’m \add here to save you\add*.”
\q1
\v 4 May those who seek my life be shamed and dishonoured.
\q1 Cause those who plan to harm me to be turned back and confused.
\q1
\v 5 May they become like chaff \add blown around by\add* the wind,
\q1 as Yahweh’s messenger drives them away.
\q1
\v 6 May their path be dark and slippery,
\q1 as Yahweh’s messenger chases after them.
\q1
\v 7 They set their net for me \add for no good reason\add*.
\q1 Without cause they dug a pit \add to take\add* my life.
\q1
\v 8 Let destruction overtake them by surprise.
\q1 Let \add their own\add* net that they set, catch them—
\q1 let them fall to their destruction in it.
\q1
\v 9 \add But I’ll\add* be happy about Yahweh
\q1 and \add celebrate because he saves me\add*.
\q1
\v 10 All my bones will say, “Yahweh, who is like you,
\q1 who rescues the oppressed \add people\add* from those who are too strong for \add them\add*
\q1 and the poor and needy from those who \add try to\add* rob \add them\add*?”
\q1
\v 11 Violent accusers \add come out of the woodwork\add*
\q1 asking me \add about things\add* that I know nothing about.
\q1
\v 12 They repay me with evil for good—
\q1 \add I feel like I’m dying on the inside\add*.
\q1
\v 13 When they were sick, I wore sackcloth
\q1 \add as\add* I fasted for them and prayed with my head bowed on my chest.
\q1
\v 14 I went about in grief as if it was my brother.
\q1 I bowed \add my head\add* in mourning as if it was my mother.
\q1
\v 15 But any time that I stumbled, they were pleased and gathered together.
\q1 They gathered together against me without me knowing.
\q1 They tore at me without stopping.
\q1
\v 16 \add With no respect at all, they mocked me\add*.
\q1 They grind their teeth at me \add in rage\add*.
\q1
\v 17 My master, how much longer will you \add just\add* look on for?
\q1 Rescue my soul from their \add destructive attacks\add*—
\q1 my life from the lions.
\q1
\v 18 Then I’ll thank you \add when everyone’s gathered together\add*.
\q1 I’ll praise you \add in front of\add* many people.
\q1
\v 19 Don’t let my deceitful enemies celebrate over \add my loses\add*.
\q1 Don’t let those who hate me for no reason wink \add at each other\add*,
\q1
\v 20 because they don’t talk peaceably,
\q1 \add but\add* they devise deceitful stories against those in our land who live in peace.
\q1
\v 21 They open their mouths wide against me,
\q1 having said, “Aha, Aha, our \add own\add* eyes have seen it.”
\q1
\v 22 You’ve seen it, Yahweh, don’t be silent.
\q1 My master, don’t be distant from me.
\q1
\v 23 Arouse yourself and awake to my defence.
\q1 My God and my master, \add defend\add* my cause.
\q1
\v 24 Yahweh, my God, vindicate me because \add you always do what is right\add*.
\q1 Don’t let \add my enemies\add* \add celebrate\add* over my \add defeat\add*.
\q1
\v 25 Don’t let them say \add to themselves\add*, “Aha, we got what we wanted.”
\q1 Don’t let them say, “We’ve \add obliterated\add* him.”
\q1
\v 26 Let anyone who’s happy at my distress be put to shame and become confused.
\q1 Let those who \add think they’re better than\add* me be clothed with shame and dishonour.
\q1
\v 27 Let those who desire my vindication shout happily and be glad.
\q1 May they continually say, “Yahweh be praised—
\q1 he who \add gladly ensues\add* the welfare of his servant.”
\q1
\v 28 Then I’ll tell \add others\add* about your justice
\q1 and praise you all day long.

\s1 Wicked people and Yahweh’s goodness
\d For the musical director: \add a song\add* by Yahweh’s servant David.
\q1
\v 1 My heart \add struggles with the disobedience of\add* evil \add people\add*.
\q1 \add They see no need to worry about God\add*
\q1
\v 2 because \add they comfort themselves\add*
\q1 thinking that \add their\add* sin won’t be discovered and be hated.
\q1
\v 3 \add Their\add* words are sinful and deceitful.
\q1 \add They\add* don’t want to be wise and do good.
\q1
\v 4 \add They\add* plot wicked things \add even\add* when \add they’re\add* lying in bed.
\q1 \add They\add* \add decide\add* on a path that’s no good—not rejecting evil.
\q1
\v 5 Your loyal commitment, Yahweh, reaches to the heavens.
\q1 Your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
\q1
\v 6 Your righteousness is like \add the highest\add*\f + \fr 36:6 \ft Literally ‘God’s’.\f* mountains.
\q1 Your judgments are like the \add deepest ocean\add*.
\q1 Yahweh, you preserve both \add people\add* and animals.
\q1
\v 7 God, your loyal commitment is so valuable.
\q1 \add You protect us like birds protect their babies under their\add* wings.
\q1
\v 8 They feast from the plentiful \add provisions\add* in your \add creation\add*.
\q1 You let them drink \add the sweet water\add* from your river.
\b
\q1
\v 9 We see light in your light
\q1 because you are the fountain of life.
\q1
\v 10 Fully show your loyal commitment to those who know you.
\q1 \add Extend\add* your defence to \add those who’re godly\add*.
\q1
\v 11 Don’t let arrogant \add people\add* approach me.
\q1 Don’t let the \add action\add* of wicked \add people\add* drive me away.
\q1
\v 12 The wicked \add people\add* have fallen \add down over\add* there.
\q1 They’ve been knocked down and aren’t able to get up.
\c 37
\s1 The endings of godly and wicked people
\d \add A song\add* by David.
\q1
\v 1 Don’t be irritated by \add those who do evil\add*.
\q1 Don’t be envious of those who do \add what is wrong\add*,
\q1
\v 2 because they’ll soon dry up like the grass
\q1 and wither as the green plants.
\q1
\v 3 Trust in Yahweh and do what is good.
\q1 \add Settle\add* in the land and \add appreciate\add* faithfulness.
\q1
\v 4 Then delight yourself in Yahweh,
\q1 and he’ll give you \add what you really desire\add*.
\q1
\v 5 \add Give\add* your path to Yahweh.
\q1 Trust in him, and he’ll act \add on your behalf\add*.
\q1
\v 6 He’ll display your justice like the daylight
\q1 and your \add innocence\add* like the day at noon.
\q1
\v 7 Be still \add in front of\add* Yahweh and wait patiently for him.
\q1 Don’t be angry if others succeed in what \add they do\add*,
\q1 or when \add they make\add* \add evil\add* plots.
\q1
\v 8 \add Don’t be angry and frustrated\add*.
\q1 Don’t \add be a worrier—that only makes trouble\add*.
\q1
\v 9 \add Those who do evil will be eliminated\add*,
\q1 \add but\add* those who \add strive to obey\add* for Yahweh will \add end up owning\add* the land.
\q1
\v 10 In a little while the evil \add people\add* will disappear.
\q1 You’ll look at \add the place where they were\add*, but \add they’ll\add* be gone.
\q1
\v 11 \add But\add* the meek will \add inherit\add* the land
\q1 and will delight in great prosperity.
\q1
\v 12 The wicked \add people\add* plot against the righteous
\q1 and grind \add their\add* teeth \add in rage\add* against \add them\add*.
\q1
\v 13 My master laughs at \add them\add*,
\q1 because \add he knows that\add* \add their\add* day is coming.
\q1
\v 14 The wicked have drawn out their \add swords\add* and have bent their \add bows\add*
\q1 to birng the oppressed and needy down—
\q1 \add yes,\add* to kill those who are \add godly\add*.
\q1
\v 15 Their \add swords\add* will \add pierce\add* their own \add hearts\add*,
\q1 and their bows will be broken.
\q1
\v 16 It’s better to do right and \add only\add* have a little,
\q1 than to be wicked and rich,
\q1
\v 17 because the arms of the wicked \add people\add* will be broken,
\q1 but Yahweh \add supports\add* \add people\add* \add who’re\add* righteous.
\q1
\v 18 Yahweh \add keeps an eye on those who’re blameless\add*,
\q1 and \add they won’t lose\add* their inheritance.
\q1
\v 19 They won’t be shamed when times \add are bad\add*.
\q1 When famine comes, they’ll have enough to eat,
\q1
\v 20 because evil \add people\add* will \add die\add*.
\q1 Yahweh’s enemies will be like the \add fleeting\add* \add beauty\add* of the fields—
\q1 they’ll be consumed and \add disappear\add* in the smoke.
\q1
\v 21 Wicked \add people\add* borrow \add but never\add* repay,
\q1 \add but\add* the \add godly\add* \add person\add* \add is generous\add* and gives.
\q1
\v 22 Those who are blessed by \add God\add* will \add own\add* the land,
\q1 \add but\add* those who are cursed by him will be \add wiped out\add*.
\q1
\v 23 It is by Yahweh that a person’s steps are established,
\q1 and he \add takes pleasure\add* in \add observing\add* their path.
\q1
\v 24 \add Even\add* if \add they\add* stumble, \add they\add* won’t fall \add on their face\add*,
\q1 because Yahweh is \add right there helping\add* \add them\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 25 I was young and now I’m old
\q1 and I’ve never seen the righteous \add person\add* abandoned
\q1 \add or\add* their children \add out begging for food\add*.
\q1
\v 26 All day long, \add they’re\add* \add gracious\add* and lend \add to those more needy\add*,
\q1 and \add their\add* children become a blessing \add to others\add*.
\q1
\v 27 Turn away from evil and do what is right,
\q1 then you will \add go on living\add*
\q1
\v 28 because Yahweh loves justice and doesn’t abandon \add those who’re faithful to him\add*.
\q1 They’re preserved forever, but the descendants of wicked \add people\add* will be \add eliminated\add*.
\q1
\v 29 The \add godly\add* \add people\add* will inherit the land
\q1 and always live there.
\q1
\v 30 \add Godly\add* \add people\add* \add expound\add* wisdom
\q1 and \add promote\add* justice.
\q1
\v 31 God’s law is \add always\add* \add on their minds\add*.
\q1 \add Their\add* feet won’t slip.
\q1
\v 32 The wicked person watches the righteous
\q1 and seeks to kill \add them\add*.
\q1
\v 33 Yahweh won’t abandon \add them\add* into the evil person’s hand
\q1 or condemn \add them\add* when \add they’re\add* judged.
\q1
\v 34 Wait for Yahweh and \add stay on the path he showed you\add*,
\q1 then he’ll \add assist you\add* to possess the land \add he promised\add*.
\q1 You’ll see those who’re wicked \add get eliminated\add*.
\q1
\v 35 I’ve seen a wicked and terrifying person
\q1 spreading out like a luxuriant tree in its native soil.
\q1
\v 36 However, when I passed by again, \add they\add* weren’t there.
\q1 I looked for \add them\add*, but \add they\add* couldn’t be found.
\q1
\v 37 Observe the person of integrity, and notice \add those who’re godly\add*.
\q1 There’s a good future for a peaceful person.
\q1
\v 38 Sinners will be totally destroyed;
\q1 The future will be cut off for wicked \add people\add*.
\q1
\v 39 Yahweh \add is the one who saves godly people\add*.
\q1 He protects them in the times of trouble.
\q1
\v 40 Yahweh helps them and rescues them.
\q1 He rescues them from evil people and saves them
\q1 because they’ve \add gone to him as a place of safety\add*.

\d A song by David for the memorial offering.
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, don’t rebuke me in your anger.
\q1 Don’t punish me in your rage,
\q1
\v 2 because your arrows pierce me,
\q1 and your hand presses me down.

\q1
\v 8 The earth trembled \add and\add* the skies also dropped rain in God’s presence—

\s1 A request for help
\d For the musical director: \add a song\add* by David \add to be sung like singing of\add* ‘Lilies’.
\q1
\v 1 Save me, God, because the waters have reached my neck.
\q1
\v 2 I sink in deep mud where there’s nowhere to stand.
\q1 I have come into deep waters where the floods flow over me.
\q1
\v 3 I’m exhausted from my crying \add for help\add*—my throat is dry.
\q1 My eyes have failed while I’ve been waiting for my God.
\q1
\v 4 \add There’s more\add* \add people\add* who hate me \add without even knowing why\add*, than there are hairs on my head.
\q1 I have many enemies who want to destroy me, \add but\add* for no good reason.
\q1 I’m forced to ‘give back’ what I didn’t steal \add in the first place\add*.
\q1
\v 5 God, you know \add the silly things that I do\add*,
\q1 and none of my sins can be hidden from you.
\q1
\v 6 Don’t let those who hope in you be put to shame because of me, my master, army commander Yahweh.
\q1 Don’t let those who \add need your help\add* be humiliated because of me, God of Israel.
\q1
\v 7 I’ve \add been ridiculed for following you\add*—
\q1 shame has covered my face.
\q1
\v 8 I’ve become a stranger to my siblings—
\q1 \add yes,\add* a foreigner to my mother’s children
\q1
\v 9 because \add my\add* zeal for your \add temple\add* has eaten me up,
\q1 and the rebukes of those who rebuke you have fallen on me.
\q1
\v 10 When I wept and \add chose not to eat\add*,
\q1 \add they insulted\add* me.
\q1
\v 11 When I \add put on\add* \add rough\add* sackcloth,
\q1 \add they just turned me into a joke\add*.
\q1
\v 12 Those who sit around the \add community court\add* talk about me,
\q1 and \add drunkards sing about me\add*.
\q1
\v 13 \add Even so,\add* my prayer is to you, Yahweh,
\q1 \add when you’re feeling favourable towards me\add*.
\q1 \add From the strength of your loyal commitment\add*,
\q2 answer me \add for sure by rescuing me\add*.
\q1
\v 14 Pull me out of the mud, and don’t let me sink.
\q1 Rescue me from those who hate me, and from deep waters.
\q1
\v 15 Don’t let the floods of water overwhelm me,
\q2 or let the deep swallow me up.
\q1 Don’t let the pit close its mouth over me.
\q1
\v 16 Answer me, Yahweh, because your loyal commitment is good.
\q1 Turn to me because \add you’ve shown so much mercy towards me\add*.
\q1
\v 17 Don’t hide from \add me,\add* your servant.
\q1 Answer me quickly, because I’m in distress.
\q1
\v 18 Come to me and redeem me.
\q1 Ransom me because of my enemies.
\q1
\v 19 You know my rebuke, my shame, and my dishonour.
\q1 All my adversaries \add report my failings to\add* you.
\q1
\v 20 \add Their\add* \add insults\add* have broken my heart—I’m full of heaviness.
\q1 I looked for someone to take pity, but no one was there.
\q1 I looked for \add someone to encourage me\add*, but I didn’t find anyone.
\q1
\v 21 They gave me poison \add to eat\add*.
\q1 \add When I was thirsty\add*, they gave me vinegar to drink.
\q1
\v 22 Let their table become a snare \add to catch them in their own schemes\add*.
\q1 When they think they’re safe, let it become a trap.
\q1
\v 23 Let their eyes be darkened so they won’t be able to see anything,
\q1 and make their \add legs\add* continually shake.
\q1
\v 24 Pour your indignation out on them,
\q1 and let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.
\q1
\v 25 Let their place become uninhabited.
\q1 Don’t let anyone live in their tents
\q1
\v 26 because they persecuted the one you struck down.
\q1 They multiplied the pain of those that you had \add already\add* wounded.
\q1
\v 27 Add sin after sin to their \add record\add*.
\q1 Don’t let them \add try to tell you about their ‘innocence’\add*.
\q1
\v 28 Let them be blotted out of the book of \add life\add*
\q1 and not have \add their names\add* written down along with \add the names of\add* the godly.
\q1
\v 29 As for me, I’m suffering and in pain.
\q1 \add Yes\add* God, protect me and rescue me.
\q1
\v 30 I’ll praise God with a song
\q1 and with thankfulness, I’ll \add tell about his goodness\add*.
\q1
\v 31 That will please Yahweh better than \add sacrificing\add* a cow,
\q1 or a \add physical\add* bull that has horns and hooves.
\q1
\v 32 Humble \add people\add* will see it and be glad.
\q1 You who \add want to obey\add* God, let your hearts live
\q1
\v 33 because Yahweh listens to the poor,
\q1 and he doesn’t despise his \add people when they’re imprisoned\add*.
\q1
\v 34 Let heaven and earth praise him,
\q1 \add including\add* the seas and everything in them that moves.
\q1
\v 35 For God will save Tsiyyon \add (Zion)\add*
\q1 and will rebuild the cities of Yehudah.
\q1 The people will live there and have it \add for their own\add*.
\q1
\v 36 The descendants of his people will inherit it,
\q1 and those who love him will live there safely.

\q1 in order to produce food from the land

\v 16 Yahweh’s trees \add have everything they need to prosper\add*—

\v 17 where the birds make their nests.
\q1 The \add storks\add* make the cypress trees their \add homes\add*.

\q1
\v 20 You make the darkness at night,
\q1 when all the animals in the forest move around.
\q1
\v 21 The young lions roar for their prey,

\v 23 \add Meanwhile\add* \add people\add* \add head off\add* to do \add their\add* work,

\q1
\v 24 Yahweh, \add you’ve made so many different kinds of things\add*.

\q1
\v 28 They gather what you give to them.
\q1 When you open your hand, they’re satisfied.

\q1
\v 31 May Yahweh’s splendour last forever.

\q1
\v 12 \add That was\add* when they were few in number—

\q1
\v 13 They wandered from country to country
\q1 \add and\add* from one kingdom to another.
\q1
\v 14 He didn’t allow \add others\add* to oppress them.
\q1 He \add even\add* scolded kings on their account.\x + \xo 105:14-15: \xt Gen 20:3-7.\x*
\q1
\v 15 He told them not to touch his chosen \add leaders\add*,

\q1
\v 16 He called for a famine in that land—\x + \xo 105:16: \xt Gen 41:53-57.\x*
\q1 \add all food supply chains\add* were broken.
\q1
\v 17 He sent a man on ahead of them,\x + \xo 105:17: \xt Gen 37:28; 45:5.\x*
\q1 \add when\add* Yosef \add (Joseph)\add* was sold as a slave.
\q1
\v 18 His feet were \add shackled together\add*.\x + \xo 105:18-19: \xt Gen 39:20–40:23.\x*
\q1 His neck was placed in an iron \add collar\add*

\v 19 until \add Yahweh’s\add*\f + \fr 105:19a \ft It’s also possible to interpret the pronoun here as referring to Yosef, as in some other translations.\f* \add order came\add*.

\q1
\v 20 \add Then\add* the king sent servants to release him.\x + \xo 105:20: \xt Gen 41:14.\x*
\q1 The people’s ruler set him free.
\q1
\v 21 He made him the master of his \add household\add*,\x + \xo 105:21: \xt Gen 41:39-41.\x*
\q1 and the ruler over all his possessions—
\q1
\v 22 to instruct his officials at his pleasure,
\q1 and to teach wisdom to his elders.
\q1
\v 23 Then Israel went to Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add*,\x + \xo 105:23: a \xt Gen 46:6; \xo b \xt Gen 47:11.\x*
\q1 \add yes,\add* Yaakov \add (Jacob)\add* \add lived for a time\add* in the land of Ham.
\q1
\v 24 Then Yahweh made his people \add have large families\add*,
\q1 and \add made them\add* much more powerful than their enemies.
\q1
\v 25 He \add caused them\add* to hate his people—
\q1 to deal craftily with his servants.
\q1
\v 26 He sent his servant Mosheh \add (Moses)\add*,\x + \xo 105:26: \xt Exo 3:1–4:17.\x*
\q1 \add and\add* Aharon \add (Aaron)\add* who he’d chosen

\q1
\v 27 They demonstrated signs \add from Yahweh\add* \add while\add* with \add the Egyptians\add*,

\q1
\v 28 He sent darkness and \add the place\add* \add went\add* dark.\x + \xo 105:28: \xt Exo 10:21-23.\x*
\q1 They \add couldn’t argue against his commands\add*.\f + \fr 105:28 \ft It’s not clear who is being talked about here, so other translations will likely differ.\f*
\q1
\v 29 He turned their water into blood,\x + \xo 105:29: \xt Exo 7:17-21.\x*
\q1 and their fish died.

\v 30 Their land swarmed with frogs,\x + \xo 105:30: \xt Exo 8:1-6.\x*
\q1 \add even\add* in the \add palace bedrooms\add*.

\q1 with fire flaming on their land.\f + \fr 105:32 \ft There was no fire mentioned in the Exodus plagues, hence some translations interpret this as lightning.\f*
\q1
\v 33 He \add destroyed\add* their grapevines and fig trees—

\q1
\v 34 He spoke \add out\add* and the locusts came\x + \xo 105:34-35: \xt Exo 10:12-15.\x*

\q1
\v 36 He \add killed\add* every \add eldest male\add* in their land—\x + \xo 105:36: \xt Exo 12:29.\x*
\q1 the \add star products\add* of their strength. STUD PRODUCTS???
\q1
\v 37 He brought \add his people\add* out \add carrying\add* gold and silver,\x + \xo 105:37-38: \xt Exo 12:33-36.\x*
\q1 No one among the tribes stumbled \add as they left\add*.
\q1
\v 38 Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add* was glad when they departed,

\q1
\v 39 He spread out a cloud for a covering\x + \xo 105:39: \xt Exo 13:21-22.\x*
\q1 and a fire to give light at night.
\q1
\v 40 \add They\add* asked, and he sent quail,\x + \xo 105:40: \xt Exo 16:2-15.\x*
\q1 and they filled up on bread from the heavens.

\q1 \add it\add* \add flowed\add* in the wilderness like a river,
\q1

\s1 Yahweh’s goodness

\q1
\v 2 Who can recount \add everything that\add* \add Yahweh’s done\add*?
\q1 Can anyone \add list\add* all his praises?
\q1
\v 3 Those who promote justice will be blessed,
\q1 as will those who always do what is right.
\q1
\v 4 When you help your people, Yahweh, remember me.
\q1 Help me when you rescue them.
\q2
\v 5 \add I want\add* to see your chosen \add people\add* \add prosper\add*—
\q1 be happy that your nation is happy
\q1 \add and\add* \add share the splendour\add* of your inheritance.
\q1
\v 6 We have \add disobeyed God\add* like our ancestors did.
\q1 We have done things that were wrong, and have acted wickedly.
\q1
\v 7 Our ancestors didn’t appreciate the miracles you did in Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add*.\x + \xo 106:7: \xt Exo 14:10-12.\x*
\q1 They \add just\add* forgot about your \add display\add* of loyal commitment,
\q1 and \add instead\add* they rebelled \add down there\add* at the Red Sea.
\q1
\v 8 \add However,\add* he saved them for \add the sake of his reputation\add*—
\q1 to make his incredible power known \add to the world\add*.
\q1
\v 9 He \add commanded the Red\add* Sea and it dried up,
\q1 then he led them through \add its\add* depths as if it was \add ordinary land\add*\x + \xo 106:9-12: \xt Exo 14:21-31.\x*
\q1
\v 10 and saved them from the \add forces\add* of those who hated them—
\q1 \add yes,\add* he rescued them from \add their\add* enemy’s \add power\add*.
\q1
\v 11 The \add water\add* \add came back over\add* their enemies—
\q1 there wasn’t a \add single\add* one of them left.
\q1
\v 12 Then they \add finally\add* believed his words,\x + \xo 106:12: \xt Exo 15:1-21.\x*
\q1 and they sang \add praises to him\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 13 But they soon forgot what he’d done.
\q1 They didn’t \add bother\add* \add waiting\add* for his advice.
\q1
\v 14 They had intense cravings \add for meat\add* in the wilderness,\x + \xo 106:14-15: \xt Num 11:4-34.\x*
\q1 and they challenged God \add right there\add* in the desert.
\q1
\v 15 \add So\add* he gave them what they asked for
\q1 \add but\add* he sent them a horrible disease \add with it\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 16 Then in the camp, they became jealous of Mosheh \add (Moses)\add*,\x + \xo 106:16-18: \xt Num 16:1-35.\x*
\q1 and Aharon \add (Aaron)\add*, Yahweh’s \add chosen priest\add*.
\q1
\v 17 The earth opened up and swallowed Datan,
\q1 and covered over Aviram’s followers.
\q1
\v 18 Then fire blazed among them,
\q1 and the flames burnt up the wicked \add people\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 19 They made a \add gold\add* calf at Horev,\x + \xo 106:19-23: \xt Exo 32:1-14.\x*
\q1 and worshipped \add the metal\add* \add statue\add* \add there\add*.
\q1
\v 20 They traded the splendour of their \add God\add*,
\q1 with a \add statue\add* image of a bull that eats \add grass\add*. ☺
\q1
\v 21 They forgot about their saviour God
\q1 who’d done incredible \add miracles\add* in Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add*,
\q1
\v 22 ≈\add had done\add* \add amazing feats\add* in the land of Ham \add (i.e., Egypt)\add*,
\q1 \add and\add* \add had demonstrated powerful forces\add* at the \add Red\add* Sea.
\q1
\v 23 So he said that he’d destroy them,
\q1 \add except that\add* his chosen \add servant\add* Mosheh stood \add as intermediary\add*,
\q1 to turn him away from his severe anger \add and plan\add* \add to destroy\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 24 Then they despised that desirable \add region—\add*\x + \xo 106:24-26: \xt Num 14:1-35.\x*
\q1 they didn’t believe his \add promise\add*.
\q1
\v 25 \add Instead\add* they grumbled in their tents
\q1 and didn’t listen to \add what Yahweh said\add*.
\q1
\v 26 \add So he made his decision against\add* them:
\q1 that they’d drop \add dead there\add* in the wilderness,
\q2
\v 27 and he’d disperse their descendants across many countries\x + \xo 106:27: \xt Lev 26:33.\x*
\q1 and scatter them in \add distant\add* lands.
\b
\q1
\v 28 They \add submitted\add* to the Baal of Peor,\x + \xo 106:28-31: \xt Num 25:1-13.\x*
\q1 and ate sacrifices \add that had been offered to\add* the dead.
\q1
\v 29 They provoked him to anger with their actions,
\q1 and a plague broke out among them.
\q1
\v 30 Then Pinehas \add took a stand\add* and intervened
\q1 and stopped the plague.
\q1
\v 31 That \add godly action\add* was credited to him,
\q1 \add for all the generations to come\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 32 They also made Yahweh angry at the Merivah springs,\x + \xo 106:32-33: \xt Num 20:2-13.\x*
\q1 and \add that led to trouble for\add* Mosheh \add (Moses)\add*,
\q1
\v 33 because they’d rebelled against his spirit,
\q1 and then he \add ended up\add* speaking rashly.
\b
\q1
\v 34 They didn’t destroy those people groups\x + \xo 106:34-36: \xt Jdg 2:1-3; 3:5-6.\x*
\q1 as Yahweh had \add told them to do\add*.
\q1
\v 35 \add Instead\add* they mingled with \add those\add* other groups,
\q1 and imitated their \add ungodly\add* activities
\q1
\v 36 and worshipped their idols
\q1 \add which then became the reason for their destruction\add*.
\q1
\v 37 They sacrificed their sons and daughters to the demons.\x + \xo 106:37: \xt 2Ki 17:17.\x*
\q1
\v 38 \add Yes,\add* they shed innocent blood—\x + \xo 106:38: \xt Num 35:33.\x*
\q1 the blood of their sons and daughters
\q1 that they sacrificed to the idols and polluted the land with blood.
\q1
\v 39 Their actions \add made them unacceptable to worship God\add*,
\q1 having prostituted themselves \add to other Gods\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 40 So Yahweh got angry with his \add own\add* people,\x + \xo 106:40-46: \xt Jdg 2:14-18.\x*
\q1 and he despised his own inheritance.
\q1
\v 41 He \add allowed other countries to control\add* them,
\q1 and those who hated them ruled over them.
\q1
\v 42 Their enemies oppressed them,
\q1 and subdued them under their \add control\add*.
\q1
\v 43 He rescued them many times,
\q1 but they kept rebelling in their \add minds\add*,
\q1 and were brought down by their \add own\add* sin.
\q1
\v 44 \add Nevertheless,\add* he \add paid attention\add* to their distress
\q1 when he heard their cry \add for help\add*.
\q1
\v 45 He \add thought about\add* his agreement with them,
\q1 and he relented because of the strength of his loyal commitment \add to them\add*.
\q1
\v 46 He \add caused\add* their conquerors to \add have pity\add* on them.
\b
\q1
\v 47 Save us Yahweh our God,\x + \xo 106:47-48: \xt 1Ch 16:35-36.\x*
\q1 and gather us \add back\add* from among \add other\add* nations
\q1 so that we can give thanks for your sacred reputation,
\q1 and \add praise you with real gladness\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 48 May Israel’s God Yahweh be praised \add throughout the ages\add*,
\q1 and all the people said, “\add Yes, let it be so\add*.”

\q1 Praise Yah.
