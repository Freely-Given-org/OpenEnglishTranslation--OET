\p
\v 1 Any person who doesn’t take advice from wicked people,
\q2 and doesn’t stand by the path that sinners use,
\q2 and doesn’t sit and join all the scoffers,
\q2 will reap the benefits.
\q1
\v 2 \add On the contrary,\add* they enjoy Yahweh’s instructions
\q2 and think about them day and night.
\q1
\v 3 Those people are like trees that are planted by a stream\x + \xo 1:3: \xt Jer 17:8.\x*
\q2 and which produce fruit in season.
\q1 Their leaves don’t wither,
\q2 and they prosper in everything they do.

\q1 they’re like straw that gets blown away by the wind.
\q1
\v 5 The wicked \add people\add* won’t be able to stand when \add God\add* judges \add them\add*,
\q1 and sinners won’t be able to join in the assembly of \add all the godly people\add*.

\v 6 Because Yahweh knows the path \add chosen by godly people\add*,
\q1 but the path of wicked \add people\add* will be destroyed.

\v 3 \add saying,\add* “Let’s break their \add chains off us\add*.
\q1 Let’s throw off their ropes.”
\q1
\v 4 \add The one who\add* sits in the heavens laughs.

\q1
\v 5 Then he’ll speak to them in his anger,
\q1 and terrify them in his fury.

\s1 David’s song of victory
\r (2 Sam. 22:1-51)
\d For the musical director: a song by Yahweh’s servant David, when he sang the words of this song to Yahweh on the day that Yahweh rescued him from Shaul \add (King Saul)\add* and all his \add other\add* enemies.
\q1
\v 1 He said:
\q1 I love you, Yahweh, my \add source of\add* strength.
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, \add the one who brings me to safety\add*.
\q1 He’s my God, my rock. I take refuge in him.
\q1 He’s my shield, the \add power that saves me\add*, my fortress.
\q1
\v 3 I will call \add for help from\add* Yahweh
\q2 who \add deserves all the praise he gets\add*,
\q1 and then I’ll be rescued from my enemies.
\q1
\v 4 \add I felt like I was about to die\add*,
\q1 and torrents of worthlessness overwhelmed me.
\q1
\v 5 The \add grave seemed to be putting its ropes around\add* me.
\q1 The snares of death trapped me.
\q1
\v 6 In my distress I called out to Yahweh.
\q1 I cried for help to my God.
\q1 He heard my voice from his temple.
\q1 My call for help entered his presence.
\q1 It \add reached\add* his ears.
\q1
\v 7 Then the earth quaked and shook.
\q1 The foundations of the mountains trembled
\q1 and were shaken because \add God\add* \add was angry\add*.
\q1
\v 8 Smoke went up from out of his nostrils,
\q1 and blazing fire came out of his mouth.
\q1 Coals were ignited by it.
\q1
\v 9 He opened the skies and came down,
\q1 and \add heavy\add* darkness was under his feet.
\q1
\v 10 He rode on a winged creature and flew.
\q1 He glided on the wings of the wind.
\q1
\v 11 He made darkness \add into\add* a tent around him—
\q1 heavy rain clouds in the skies.
\q1
\v 12 Hail and \add burning\add* coals fell from the brightness in front of him.
\q1
\v 13 Yahweh thundered from the heavens.
\q1 The voice of the highest \add one\add* shouted.\f + \fr 18:13 \ft ‘hail and burning coals’ has been omitted from this translation as the Hebrew words are assumed to have been accidentally copied from the previous verse.\f*
\q1
\v 14 He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies—
\q1 many lightning bolts, and \add forced them to disperse\add*.
\q1
\v 15 Then the water channels appeared.
\q1 The foundations of the world were exposed
\q2 at your rebuke, Yahweh—
\q1 at the blast of the breath from your nostrils.
\q1
\v 16 He reached down from above \add and\add* took hold of me.
\q1 He pulled me out of the surging waters.
\q1
\v 17 He rescued me from my powerful enemy—
\q1 from those who hated me,
\q1 because they were too strong for me.
\q1
\v 18 They confronted me \add when I was in\add* distress,
\q1 \add but\add* Yahweh was my support.
\q1
\v 19 He brought me out to a wide open place.
\q1 He saved me because he was pleased with me.
\q1
\v 20 Yahweh has rewarded me because \add I’ve done nothing wrong\add*.
\q1 He has restored me because \add I’m innocent\add*.

\v 21 because I’ve \add followed\add* Yahweh’s \add instructions\add*
\q1 and haven’t acted wickedly towards my God.
\q1
\v 22 \add I keep all his instructions in mind\add*,
\q1 and I haven’t \add refused to follow any of his rules\add*.
\q1
\v 23 I’ve \add done nothing that he could blame me for\add*
\q1 and I’ve kept myself from \add disobeying him\add*.
\q1
\v 24 \add So\add* Yahweh has restored me because of my \add obedience\add*,
\q1 because \add I was innocent in his sight\add*.
\q1
\v 25 To the faithful, you show yourself faithful.
\q1 To the blameless, you show yourself blameless.
\q1
\v 26 ≈To the pure, you show yourself pure,
\q1 but you’re shrewd towards anyone who’s crooked,

\v 27 because you save people \add who’re suffering\add*,
\q1 \add but\add* you bring down those with \add proud,\add* uplifted eyes.
\q1
\v 28 You give light to my lamp.
\q1 Yahweh my God lights up my darkness.
\q1
\v 29 \add With your help\add*, I \add can run forward into the invaders\add*.
\q1 \add With my God’s assistance\add*, I can leap over a wall.

\v 30 As for God, his \add ways are\add* perfect.
\q1 Yahweh’s message has been refined.
\q1 He is a shield to everyone who \add goes to him to stay safe\add*,
\q1
\v 31 because who is God except Yahweh?
\q1 Who is a \add reliable place of safety\add* except our God?
\q1
\v 32 It is God who puts strength onto me like a belt \add around me\add*—
\q1 who makes my path \add clear of obstacles\add*.
\q1
\v 33 He makes \add me sure-footed\add* like a deer,
\q1 and places me in the \add hills\add*.\x + \xo 18:33: \xt Heb 3:19.\x*
\q1
\v 34 He trains my hands for battle,
\q1 and my arms to bend a bronze bow.
\q1
\v 35 You \add protect and save me with your\add* shield.
\q1 You \add use your power to\add* support me,
\q1 and your favour has made me \add strong\add*.
\q1
\v 36 You’ve made the path for my feet \add wide\add* beneath me

\v 38 I smashed them so that they were unable to \add regroup\add*.
\q1 They have fallen under my feet.
\q1
\v 39 You put strength on me for battle \add like a belt around me\add*.
\q1 You made my enemies bow down to me.
\q1
\v 40 You \add allowed me to kill my enemies\add*.
\q1 I annihilated those who hated me.
\q1
\v 41 They called for help, but no rescuer \add came\add*.
\q1 \add They called out\add* to Yahweh, but he didn’t answer them.
\q1
\v 42 I \add hammered\add* them into fine pieces like dust in the wind.
\q1 I emptied them out like mud in the streets.
\q1
\v 43 You rescued me from people’s feuds.
\q1 You’ve made me the head over nations.
\q1 People serve me that I never knew \add before\add*.
\q1
\v 44 As soon as they heard \add about me\add*, they obeyed me.
\q1 Foreigners \add cower down\add* to me.

\v 47 He’s the God who executes vengeance \add on my behalf\add*—

\q1
\v 48 I’m set free from my enemies.
\q1 Indeed, you \add helped me stay ahead of those who opposed me\add*.
\q1 You rescued me from violent men.
\q1
\v 49 Therefore I’ll give thanks to you among the nations, Yahweh,

\s1 Staying close to God
\d A song by David when he was in the Yehudah wilderness.
\q1
\v 1 God, you’re my God. I’m \add eager to get to know\add* you.
\q1 My \add inner being\add* thirsts for you, and my body \add needs\add* you
\q1 in a dry and \add depressing\add* land where there’s no water,
\q1
\v 2 so I’ve been to the sanctuary to see you—
\q1 to see your power and your splendour
\q1
\v 3 because your loyal commitment is better than life \add itself\add*.
\q1 My lips will praise you.
\q1
\v 4 So I will \add use my life to\add* bless you.
\q1 I will lift up my hands \add to honour you\add*.
\q1
\v 5 \add My mind\add* will be satisfied as if \add it’s had a good meal\add*.
\q1 My mouth will gladly praise you
\q1
\v 6 on my bed as I \add think about\add* you.
\q1 I will meditate about you during the night
\q1
\v 7 because you have helped me.
\q1 \add Under your protection\add*, I sing with happiness
\q1
\v 8 \add I stay close to you\add*—
\q1 \add you use your power to support me\add*.
\q1
\v 9 Those who’re trying to destroy \add me\add*
\q1 will \add end up\add* down deep under the earth \add instead\add*.
\q1
\v 10 They’ll \add experience the wrong end of\add* the sword—
\q1 they’ll \add become food\add* for jackals.
\q1
\v 11 \add But\add* the king will \add express his happiness\add* about God.

\d For the musical director: a song by David.
\q1
\v 1 Hear my voice of complaint, God.
\q1 Save my from my enemies that I fear.
\q1
\v 2 Protect me from the secret plots of wicked people—
\q1 from the scheming of those who do evil.
\q1
\v 3 They have sharpened their tongues like swords.
\q1 They have targeted their bitter words \add like\add* aiming arrows
\q1
\v 4 to shoot at innocent people from their ambush—
\q1 they shoot suddenly and don’t fear \add any consequences\add*.
\q1
\v 5 They encourage \add each other\add* with their wicked \add plans\add*.
\q1 They talk about secretly laying their traps,
\q1 \add asking\add* who will \add notice\add* them.
\q1
\v 6 They plot crimes, conceiving the ‘perfect plan’.
\q1 Humankind’s inner \add thoughts\add* and \add desires run\add* deep.

\q1
\v 1 Save me, God, because the waters have reached my neck.
\q1
\v 2 I sink in deep mud where there’s nowhere to stand.
\q1 I have come into deep waters where the floods flow over me.
\q1
\v 3 I’m exhausted from my crying \add for help\add*—my throat is dry.
\q1 My eyes have failed while I’ve been waiting for my God.
\q1
\v 4 \add There’s more\add* \add people\add* who hate me \add without even knowing why\add*, than there are hairs on my head.
\q1 I have many enemies who want to destroy me, \add but\add* for no good reason.
\q1 I’m forced to ‘give back’ what I didn’t steal \add in the first place\add*.
\q1
\v 5 God, you know \add the silly things that I do\add*,
\q1 and none of my sins can be hidden from you.
\q1
\v 6 Don’t let those who hope in you be put to shame because of me, my master, army commander Yahweh.
\q1 Don’t let those who \add need your help\add* be humiliated because of me, God of Israel.
\q1
\v 7 I’ve \add been ridiculed for following you\add*—
\q1 shame has covered my face.
\q1
\v 8 I’ve become a stranger to my siblings—
\q1 \add yes,\add* a foreigner to my mother’s children
\q1
\v 9 because \add my\add* zeal for your \add temple\add* has eaten me up,
\q1 and the rebukes of those who rebuke you have fallen on me.
\q1
\v 10 When I wept and \add chose not to eat\add*,
\q1 \add they insulted\add* me.
\q1
\v 11 When I \add put on\add* \add rough\add* sackcloth,
\q1 \add they just turned me into a joke\add*.
\q1
\v 12 Those who sit around the \add community court\add* talk about me,
\q1 and \add drunkards sing about me\add*.
\q1
\v 13 \add Even so,\add* my prayer is to you, Yahweh,
\q1 \add when you’re feeling favourable towards me\add*.
\q1 \add From the strength of your loyal commitment\add*,
\q2 answer me \add for sure by rescuing me\add*.
\q1
\v 14 Pull me out of the mud, and don’t let me sink.
\q1 Rescue me from those who hate me, and from deep waters.
\q1
\v 15 Don’t let the floods of water overwhelm me,
\q2 or let the deep swallow me up.
\q1 Don’t let the pit close its mouth over me.
\q1
\v 16 Answer me, Yahweh, because your loyal commitment is good.
\q1 Turn to me because \add you’ve shown so much mercy towards me\add*.
\q1
\v 17 Don’t hide from \add me,\add* your servant.
\q1 Answer me quickly, because I’m in distress.
\q1
\v 18 Come to me and redeem me.
\q1 Ransom me because of my enemies.
\q1
\v 19 You know my rebuke, my shame, and my dishonour.
\q1 All my adversaries \add report my failings to\add* you.
\q1
\v 20 \add Their\add* \add insults\add* have broken my heart—I’m full of heaviness.
\q1 I looked for someone to take pity, but no one was there.
\q1 I looked for \add someone to encourage me\add*, but I didn’t find anyone.
\q1
\v 21 They gave me poison \add to eat\add*.
\q1 \add When I was thirsty\add*, they gave me vinegar to drink.
\q1
\v 22 Let their table become a snare \add to catch them in their own schemes\add*.
\q1 When they think they’re safe, let it become a trap.
\q1
\v 23 Let their eyes be darkened so they won’t be able to see anything,
\q1 and make their \add legs\add* continually shake.
\q1
\v 24 Pour your indignation out on them,
\q1 and let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.
\q1
\v 25 Let their place become unihabited.
\q1 Don’t let ayone live in their tents
\q1
\v 26 because they persecuted the one you struck down.
\q1 They multiplied the pain of those that you had \add already\add* wounded.
\q1
\v 27 Add sin after sin to their \add record\add*.
\q1 Don’t let them \add try to tell you about their ‘innocence’\add*.
\q1
\v 28 Let them be blotted out of the book of \add life\add*
\q1 and not have \add their names\add* written down along with \add the names of\add* the godly.
\q1
\v 29 As for me, I’m suffering and in pain.
\q1 \add Yes\add* God, protect me and rescue me.
\q1
\v 30 I’ll praise God with a song
\q1 and with thankfulness, I’ll \add tell about his goodness\add*.
\q1
\v 31 That will please Yahweh better than \add sacrificing\add* a cow,
\q1 or a \add physical\add* bull that has horns and hooves.
\q1
\v 32 Humble \add people\add* will see it and be glad.
\q1 You who \add want to obey\add* God, let your hearts live
\q1
\v 33 because Yahweh listens to the poor,
\q1 and he doesn’t despise his \add people when they’re imprisoned\add*.
\q1
\v 34 Let heaven and earth praise him,
\q1 \add including\add* the seas and everything in them that moves.
\q1
\v 35 For God will save Tsiyyon \add (Zion)\add*
\q1 and will rebuild the cities of Yehudah.
\q1 The people will live there and have it \add for their own\add*.
\q1
\v 36 The descendants of his people will inherit it,

\s1 Praising the creator
\q1
\v 1 Bless Yahweh, my \add own\add* inner being.
\q1 Yahweh my God, you are very powerful.
\q1 You are clothed with splendour and majesty.
\q1
\v 2 You wrap yourself in light as if it’s a robe.
\q1 You stretched out the heavens like a tent.
\q1
\v 3 The floor joists for your rooms are laid across the clouds.
\q1 You make the clouds your chariot—
\q1 you walk on the wings of the wind.
\q1
\v 4 He makes the winds his messengers,
\q1 \add and\add* \add makes\add* flames of fire his servants.\x + \xo 104:4: \xt Heb 1:7.\x*
\q1
\v 5 He laid the foundations of \add this planet\add*,
\q1 and it will never be shaken \add off\add*.
\q1
\v 6 You covered it with deep \add water\add* like a \add jacket\add*.
\q1 The waters stood above the mountains.
\q1
\v 7 \add Then\add* your rebuke made \add the waters\add* recede.
\q1 They hurried away at the thunderous sound \add of your voice\add*.
\q1
\v 8 The mountains rose up and the valleys sunk down—
\q1 \add all\add* into the \add places\add* that you’d established for them.
\q1
\v 9 You set a boundary that \add the waters\add* won’t cross again to cover the earth.
\q1
\v 10 \add Now\add* he sends springs to flow into the valleys,
\q1 \add and that\add* flow between the mountains.
\q1
\v 11 They \add supply water for\add* all the animals in the countryside—
\q1 the wild donkeys can break their thirst.
\q1
\v 12 The birds build their nests beside them.
\q1 They \add chirp away from among the greenery\add*.
\q1
\v 13 He waters the mountains from his rooms above.
\q1 The land becomes satisfied because of \add his\add* work.
\q1
\v 14 He makes the grass grow for the cattle,
\q1 and plants for people to cultivate,
\q1 in order to produce food from the land
\q1
\v 15 and wine that makes people’s hearts happy,
\q1 \add along with\add* oil that makes faces shine
\q1 and bread that sustains the \add people’s bodies\add*.
\q1
\v 16 Yahweh’s trees \add have everything they need to prosper\add*—
\q1 \add including\add* Lebanon’s cedars that he planted,
\q1
\v 17 where the birds make their nests.
\q1 The \add storks\add* make the cypress trees their \add homes\add*.
\q1
\v 18 The high hills are for the wild goats.
\q1 \add Their\add* crevices are a safe place for the rock badgers.
\q1
\v 19 He made the moon \add to mark\add* the \add months\add*.
\q1 The suns knows \add when it’s time to go down\add*.
\q1
\v 20 You make the darkness at night,
\q1 when all the animals in the forest move around.
\q1
\v 21 The young lions roar for their prey,
\q1 and \add expect God to supply\add* their food.
\q1
\v 22 They \add slink away\add* when the sun \add comes up\add*

\q1
\v 24 Yahweh, \add you’ve made so many different kinds of things\add*.
\q1 You \add used your wisdom when you made them\add*.
\q1 \add Now\add* the earth is full with your \add various\add* creatures.
\q1
\v 25 The ocean is \add wide\add* and huge—

\v 26 Ships \add travel across it\add*.
\q1 The sea dragon that you formed plays in it.\x + \xo 104:26: \xt Yob 41:1; Psa 74:14; Isa 27:1.\x*
\q1
\v 27 All of them look to you

\q1
\v 28 They gather what you give to them.
\q1 When you open your hand, they’re satisfied.
\q1
\v 29 When you hide your face, they’re upset.
\q1 If you take away their breath, they die and return to dust.
\q1
\v 30 When you send out your spirit, they’re created,
\q1 and you renew the ground’s surface.
\q1
\v 31 May Yahweh’s splendour last forever.
\q1 May Yahweh \add find pleasure in everything he’s made and done\add*.
\q1
\v 32 He \add just\add* looks at the world and it trembles.
\q1 He touches the mountains and they \add start\add* smoking.
\q1
\v 33 I will sing to Yahweh all my life.
\q1 I will sing praises to my God as long as I have \add breath\add*.
\q1
\v 34 May my \add thoughts please\add* him.
\q1 I’m happy about Yahweh.
\q1
\v 35 May sinners be destroyed from the world,

\q1
\v 12 \add That was\add* when they were few in number—

\q1
\v 13 They wandered from country to country
\q1 \add and\add* from one kingdom to another.
\q1
\v 14 He didn’t allow \add others\add* to oppress them.
\q1 He \add even\add* scolded kings on their account.\x + \xo 105:14-15: \xt Gen 20:3-7.\x*
\q1
\v 15 He told them not to touch his chosen \add leaders\add*,

\q1
\v 16 He called for a famine in that land—\x + \xo 105:16: \xt Gen 41:53-57.\x*
\q1 \add all food supply chains\add* were broken.
\q1
\v 17 He sent a man on ahead of them,\x + \xo 105:17: \xt Gen 37:28; 45:5.\x*

\q1
\v 18 His feet were \add shackled together\add*.\x + \xo 105:18-19: \xt Gen 39:20–40:23.\x*

\q1
\v 20 \add Then\add* the king sent servants to release him.\x + \xo 105:20: \xt Gen 41:14.\x*
\q1 The people’s ruler set him free.
\q1
\v 21 He made him the master of his \add household\add*,\x + \xo 105:21: \xt Gen 41:39-41.\x*
\q1 and the ruler over all his possessions—
\q1
\v 22 to instruct his officials at his pleasure,

\q1
\v 23 Then Israel went to Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add*,\x + \xo 105:23: a \xt Gen 46:6; \xo b \xt Gen 47:11.\x*
\q1 \add yes,\add* Yaakov \add (Jacob)\add* \add lived for a time\add* in the land of Ham.
\q1
\v 24 Then Yahweh made his people \add have large families\add*,
\q1 and \add made them\add* much more powerful than their enemies.
\q1
\v 25 He \add caused them\add* to hate his people—

\q1
\v 26 He sent his servant Mosheh \add (Moses)\add*,\x + \xo 105:26: \xt Exo 3:1–4:17.\x*
\q1 \add and\add* Aharon \add (Aaron)\add* who he’d chosen

\q1
\v 27 They demonstrated signs \add from Yahweh\add* \add while\add* with \add the Egyptians\add*,

\q1
\v 28 He sent darkness and \add the place\add* \add went\add* dark.\x + \xo 105:28: \xt Exo 10:21-23.\x*

\q1
\v 29 He turned their water into blood,\x + \xo 105:29: \xt Exo 7:17-21.\x*

\q1
\v 37 He brought \add his people\add* out \add carrying\add* gold and silver,\x + \xo 105:37-38: \xt Exo 12:33-36.\x*
\q1 No one among the tribes stumbled \add as they left\add*.
\q1
\v 38 Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add* was glad when they departed,

\q1
\v 4 When you help your people, Yahweh, remember me.

\v 5 \add I want\add* to see your chosen \add people\add* \add prosper\add*—
\q1 be happy that your nation is happy
\q1 \add and\add* \add share the splendour\add* of your inheritance.
\q1
\v 6 We have \add disobeyed God\add* like our ancestors did.
\q1 We have done things that were wrong, and have acted wickedly.
\q1
\v 7 Our ancestors didn’t appreciate the miracles you did in Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add*.\x + \xo 106:7: \xt Exo 14:10-12.\x*
\q1 They \add just\add* forgot about your \add display\add* of loyal commitment,
\q1 and \add instead\add* they rebelled \add down there\add* at the Red Sea.
\q1
\v 8 \add However,\add* he saved them for \add the sake of his reputation\add*—
\q1 to make his incredible power known \add to the world\add*.
\q1
\v 9 He \add commanded the Red\add* Sea and it dried up,

\q1
\v 10 and saved them from the \add forces\add* of those who hated them—

\q1
\v 11 The \add water\add* \add came back over\add* their enemies—
\q1 there wasn’t a \add single\add* one of them left.
\q1
\v 12 Then they \add finally\add* believed his words,\x + \xo 106:12: \xt Exo 15:1-21.\x*
\q1 and they sang \add praises to him\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 13 But they soon forgot what he’d done.
\q1 They didn’t \add bother\add* \add waiting\add* for his advice.
\q1
\v 14 They had intense cravings \add for meat\add* in the wilderness,\x + \xo 106:14-15: \xt Num 11:4-34.\x*
\q1 and they challenged God \add right there\add* in the desert.
\q1
\v 15 \add So\add* he gave them what they asked for
\q1 \add but\add* he sent them a horrible disease \add with it\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 16 Then in the camp, they became jealous of Mosheh \add (Moses)\add*,\x + \xo 106:16-18: \xt Num 16:1-35.\x*
\q1 and Aharon \add (Aaron)\add*, Yahweh’s \add chosen priest\add*.
\q1
\v 17 The earth opened up and swallowed Datan,
\q1 and covered over Aviram’s followers.
\q1
\v 18 Then fire blazed among them,
\q1 and the flames burnt up the wicked \add people\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 19 They made a \add gold\add* calf at Horev,\x + \xo 106:19-23: \xt Exo 32:1-14.\x*
\q1 and worshipped \add the metal\add* \add statue\add* \add there\add*.
\q1
\v 20 They traded the splendour of their \add God\add*,
\q1 with a \add statue\add* image of a bull that eats \add grass\add*. ☺
\q1
\v 21 They forgot about their saviour God
\q1 who’d done incredible \add miracles\add* in Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add*,
\q1
\v 22 ≈\add had done\add* \add amazing feats\add* in the land of Ham \add (i.e., Egypt)\add*,
\q1 \add and\add* \add had demonstrated powerful forces\add* at the \add Red\add* Sea.
\q1
\v 23 So he said that he’d destroy them,
\q1 \add except that\add* his chosen \add servant\add* Mosheh stood \add as intermediary\add*,
\q1 to turn him away from his severe anger \add and plan\add* \add to destroy\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 24 Then they despised that desirable \add region—\add*\x + \xo 106:24-26: \xt Num 14:1-35.\x*
\q1 they didn’t believe his \add promise\add*.
\q1
\v 25 \add Instead\add* they grumbled in their tents
\q1 and didn’t listen to \add what Yahweh said\add*.
\q1
\v 26 \add So he made his decision against\add* them:
\q1 that they’d drop \add dead there\add* in the wilderness,
\q2
\v 27 and he’d disperse their descendants across many countries\x + \xo 106:27: \xt Lev 26:33.\x*
\q1 and scatter them in \add distant\add* lands.
\b
\q1
\v 28 They \add submitted\add* to the Baal of Peor,\x + \xo 106:28-31: \xt Num 25:1-13.\x*
\q1 and ate sacrifices \add that had been offered to\add* the dead.
\q1
\v 29 They provoked him to anger with their actions,
\q1 and a plague broke out among them.
\q1
\v 30 Then Pinehas \add took a stand\add* and intervened
\q1 and stopped the plague.
\q1
\v 31 That \add godly action\add* was credited to him,
\q1 \add for all the generations to come\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 32 They also made Yahweh angry at the Merivah springs,\x + \xo 106:32-33: \xt Num 20:2-13.\x*
\q1 and \add that led to trouble for\add* Mosheh \add (Moses)\add*,
\q1
\v 33 because they’d rebelled against his spirit,
\q1 and then he \add ended up\add* speaking rashly.
\b
\q1
\v 34 They didn’t destroy those people groups\x + \xo 106:34-36: \xt Jdg 2:1-3; 3:5-6.\x*
\q1 as Yahweh had \add told them to do\add*.
\q1
\v 35 \add Instead\add* they mingled with \add those\add* other groups,
\q1 and imitated their \add ungodly\add* activities
\q1
\v 36 and worshipped their idols
\q1 \add which then became the reason for their destruction\add*.
\q1
\v 37 They sacrificed their sons and daughters to the demons.\x + \xo 106:37: \xt 2Ki 17:17.\x*
\q1
\v 38 \add Yes,\add* they shed innocent blood—\x + \xo 106:38: \xt Num 35:33.\x*
\q1 the blood of their sons and daughters
\q1 that they sacrificed to the idols and polluted the land with blood.
\q1
\v 39 Their actions \add made them unacceptable to worship God\add*,
\q1 having prostituted themselves \add to other Gods\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 40 So Yahweh got angry with his \add own\add* people,\x + \xo 106:40-46: \xt Jdg 2:14-18.\x*
\q1 and he despised his own inheritance.
\q1
\v 41 He \add allowed other countries to control\add* them,
\q1 and those who hated them ruled over them.
\q1
\v 42 Their enemies oppressed them,
\q1 and subdued them under their \add control\add*.
\q1
\v 43 He rescued them many times,
\q1 but they kept rebelling in their \add minds\add*,
\q1 and were brought down by their \add own\add* sin.
\q1
\v 44 \add Nevertheless,\add* he \add paid attention\add* to their distress
\q1 when he heard their cry \add for help\add*.
\q1
\v 45 He \add thought about\add* his agreement with them,
\q1 and he relented because of the strength of his loyal commitment \add to them\add*.
\q1
\v 46 He \add caused\add* their conquerors to \add have pity\add* on them.
\b
\q1
\v 47 Save us Yahweh our God,\x + \xo 106:47-48: \xt 1Ch 16:35-36.\x*
\q1 and gather us \add back\add* from among \add other\add* nations
\q1 so that we can give thanks for your sacred reputation,
\q1 and \add praise you with real gladness\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 48 May Israel’s God Yahweh be praised \add throughout the ages\add*,
\q1 and all the people said, “\add Yes, let it be so\add*.”
