\is1 Introduction
\ip This collection of \bk Songs\bk* includes songs, poems, chants, and prayers that the Hebrews used in their meditation and worship, and then those eventually got added to this collection. We have chosen not to use the name ‘Psalms’ which comes from the Greek word ‘ψαλμός’ which means ‘a song sung to the harp’, because most English readers don’t even know that meaning. The title ‘Songs’ isn’t perhaps ideal, but does at least suggest that they were sung, read, or chanted with music.
\ip There are many classes of the songs for believers in God: there are songs of praising and worshipping God, there are prayers for requesting help, and of meaning/salvation, requesting of forgiveness, song of thanking of blessing of God, and requests curse their enemies. These prayers all for of each person and for of entire place; the other, migpakita of peg-ealig of person, the other, explained of me it’s necessary and loving of all people of God.
\ip Seven of these songs/poems are acrostic poems, i.e., the first verse starts with the first Hebrew letter (alef) and the second with the second Hebrew letter (beyt), etc. We have chosen to display those Hebrew letters to help the English reader understand that there is that acrostic background to the poem. The seven songs are Song 25, Song 34, Song 37, Song 111, Song 112, the longest Song 119, and Song 145.
\ip Yeshua (Jesus) and other contributors to \bk The Messianic Update\bk* (The New Testament) used these songs, and intumpisan e this collection of worshipping of church of believers from the beginning.
\ip The one hundred and fifty songs are divided into five sub-collections.
\iot Main components of this collection

Used their that of worshipping ran there to most, and there to eglunsud-lunsud just worshipping. The other here, used their of time still of King David, what if he indeed the writer here. And/Now the other, and maybe it’s written at the completion of David’s kingdom. And/Now the that songs and praying, important still today used of worshipping of Hebrew believers. These songs reveal the inner emotions of the person, like anger, egpangkus of happiness, anger, egpangkus of trusting and sorrow egpangkus of hope.

\s1 Wicked and godly roads
\p
\v 1 Any person who doesn’t take advice from wicked people,
\q2 and doesn’t stand by the path that sinners use,
\q2 and doesn’t sit and join all the scoffers,
\q2 will reap the benefits.
\q1
\v 2 \add On the contrary,\add* they enjoy Yahweh’s instructions
\q2 and think about them day and night.
\q1
\v 3 Those people are like trees that are planted by a stream\x + \xo 1:3: \xt Jer 17:8.\x*
\q2 and which produce fruit in season.
\q1 Their leaves don’t wither,
\q2 and they prosper in everything they do.\x + \xo 1:3 \xt Gen 29:2-3.\x*
\b
\q1
\v 4 \add But\add* wicked \add people\add* won’t \add prosper\add*—
\q1 they’re like straw that gets blown away by the wind.
\q1
\v 5 The wicked \add people\add* won’t be able to stand when \add God\add* judges \add them\add*,
\q1 and sinners won’t be able to join in the assembly of \add all the godly people\add*.
\q1
\v 6 Because Yahweh knows the path \add chosen by godly people\add*,
\q1 but the path of wicked \add people\add* will be destroyed.
\c 2
\s1 God’s chosen king
\q1
\v 1 Why do nations make plans,\x + \xo 2:1-2: \xt Acts 4:25-26.\x*
\q2 and people groups devise empty schemes?
\q1
\v 2 The kings of \add this\add* world take their stand
\q2 and the rulers collaborate against Yahweh and his chosen \add one\add*,
\q1
\v 3 \add saying,\add* “Let’s break their \add chains off us\add*.
\q1 Let’s throw off their ropes.”
\q1
\v 4 \add The one who\add* sits in the heavens laughs.
\q1 The master ridicules them.
\q1
\v 5 Then he’ll speak to them in his anger,
\q1 and terrify them in his fury.
\q1
\v 6 \add Yahweh says,\add* “I myself have placed my king on Tsiyyon \add (Zion)\add*—
\q2 the hill \add I’ve chosen to be my holy place\add*.”
\q1
\v 7 I’ll explain Yahweh’s decree.\x + \xo 2:7: \xt Acts 13:33; Heb 1:5; 5:5.\x*
\q1 He told me, “You’re my son. Today I’ve \add become your father\add*.
\q1
\v 8 Ask me and I’ll give the nations to you for your inheritance.
\q1 The whole world will \add be owned by\add* you.
\q1
\v 9 You’ll break those nations with an iron bar.\x + \xo 2:9: \xt Rev 2:26-27; 12:5; 19:15.\x*
\q1 You’ll smash them to pieces like a clay pot.”
\b

\q1 Be warned \add all\add* you rulers of the earth.
\q1
\v 11 Serve Yahweh with fear.
\q1 Be happy \add for his goodness but\add* tremble \add because of his power\add*.
\q1

\q1
\v 2 Many \add people\add* are talking about me,
\q1 \add saying that\add* God won’t help me. \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Many older translations place the word ‘Selah’ (the transliteration of the Hebrew word ‘סֶֽלָה’ which we’re not completely sure of the meaning of) here, but that’s meaningless to most modern-English readers so the \+em OET\+em* makes an informed attempt at a translation. ‘Pause and reflect’ would also have been a likely meaning. For more information, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selah.\f*

\q1
\v 4 \add How come that you even notice humankind\add*?\f + \fr 8:4 \ft It’s important to use singular nouns in this verse, otherwise it would fail to match the singular in the next verse.\f*

\q1
\v 3 Yahweh, cut off all \add those\add* flattering lips,

\v 5 Yahweh says, “I’ll \add take action\add*

\s1 David’s song of victory
\r (2 Sam. 22:1-51)
\d For the musical director: a song by Yahweh’s servant David, when he sang the words of this song to Yahweh on the day that Yahweh rescued him from Shaul \add (King Saul)\add* and all his \add other\add* enemies.
\q1
\v 1 He said:
\q1 I love you, Yahweh, my \add source of\add* strength.
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, \add the one who brings me to safety\add*.
\q1 He’s my God, my rock. I take refuge in him.
\q1 He’s my shield, the \add power that saves me\add*, my fortress.
\q1
\v 3 I will call \add for help from\add* Yahweh
\q2 who \add deserves all the praise he gets\add*,
\q1 and then I’ll be rescued from my enemies.
\q1
\v 4 \add I felt like I was about to die\add*,
\q1 and torrents of worthlessness overwhelmed me.
\q1
\v 5 The \add grave seemed to be putting its ropes around\add* me.
\q1 The snares of death trapped me.
\q1
\v 6 In my distress I called out to Yahweh.
\q1 I cried for help to my God.
\q1 He heard my voice from his temple.
\q1 My call for help entered his presence.
\q1 It \add reached\add* his ears.
\q1
\v 7 Then the earth quaked and shook.
\q1 The foundations of the mountains trembled
\q1 and were shaken because \add God\add* \add was angry\add*.
\q1
\v 8 Smoke went up from out of his nostrils,
\q1 and blazing fire came out of his mouth.
\q1 Coals were ignited by it.
\q1
\v 9 He opened the skies and came down,
\q1 and \add heavy\add* darkness was under his feet.
\q1
\v 10 He rode on a winged creature and flew.
\q1 He glided on the wings of the wind.
\q1
\v 11 He made darkness \add into\add* a tent around him—
\q1 heavy rain clouds in the skies.
\q1
\v 12 Hail and \add burning\add* coals fell from the brightness in front of him.
\q1
\v 13 Yahweh thundered from the heavens.
\q1 The voice of the highest \add one\add* shouted.\f + \fr 18:13 \ft ‘hail and burning coals’ has been omitted from this translation as the Hebrew words are assumed to have been accidentally copied from the previous verse.\f*
\q1
\v 14 He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies—
\q1 many lightning bolts, and \add forced them to disperse\add*.
\q1
\v 15 Then the water channels appeared.
\q1 The foundations of the world were exposed
\q2 at your rebuke, Yahweh—
\q1 at the blast of the breath from your nostrils.
\q1
\v 16 He reached down from above \add and\add* took hold of me.
\q1 He pulled me out of the surging waters.
\q1
\v 17 He rescued me from my powerful enemy—
\q1 from those who hated me,
\q1 because they were too strong for me.
\q1
\v 18 They confronted me \add when I was in\add* distress,
\q1 \add but\add* Yahweh was my support.
\q1
\v 19 He brought me out to a wide open place.
\q1 He saved me because he was pleased with me.
\q1
\v 20 Yahweh has rewarded me because \add I’ve done nothing wrong\add*.
\q1 He has restored me because \add I’m innocent\add*.

\q1 and haven’t acted wickedly towards my God.

\v 23 I’ve \add done nothing that he could blame me for\add*
\q1 and I’ve kept myself from \add disobeying him\add*.

\v 25 To the faithful, you show yourself faithful.

\v 33 He makes \add me sure-footed\add* like a deer,
\q1 and places me in the \add hills\add*.\x + \xo 18:33: \xt Heb 3:19.\x*
\q1
\v 34 He trains my hands for battle,

\v 35 You \add protect and save me with your\add* shield.
\q1 You \add use your power to\add* support me,

\q1
\v 36 You’ve made the path for my feet \add wide\add* beneath me

\q1
\v 42 I \add hammered\add* them into fine pieces like dust in the wind.

\q1 You didn’t \add actually\add* want burnt-offerings or sin-offerings.
\q1
\v 7 Then said I, “See, I’ve come.
\q1 I’m written about in the scroll of the document.
\q1
\v 8 I enjoy doing what you want, my God.
\q1 Your instructions are \add on my mind\add*.”
\q1
\v 9 I have \add told everyone\add* in the \add national\add* assembly \add about how you always do what is right\add*.
\q1 Yahweh, you know that \add I haven’t shied back\add* from doing that.
\q1
\v 10 I haven’t hidden your righteousness away in my heart—
\q1 I’ve declared your faithfulness and \add how you saved me\add*.
\q1 I haven’t concealed your loyal commitment or your trustworthiness from the \add national\add* assembly.
\q1
\v 11 Don’t \add stop being merciful towards\add* me, Yahweh.
\q1 Let your loyal commitment and your trustworthiness always preserve me.
\q1
\v 12 More troubles surround me than I can even count.
\q1 My disobedience has caught up with me so that I’m no longer able to see \add anything else\add*.
\q1 They’re more than the hairs on my head, and my heart fails me.
\q1
\v 13 Be pleased, Yahweh, to rescue me.
\q1 Hurry to help me, Yahweh.
\q1
\v 14 Let \add those who chase me to take\add* my life be ashamed and completely disappointed.
\q1 Let those who delight in hurting me be turned back and brought to dishonour.
\q1
\v 15 Let those who \add cheer because of my fate\add* be shocked because of their shame.

\q1
\v 1 \add People\add* who’re concerned for the weak will be blessed—

\q1
\v 2 Yahweh will protect \add them\add* and keep \add them\add* alive,

\v 3 Yahweh will support \add them\add* on the bed of suffering.
\q1 You’ll make \add their\add* bed of sickness into a bed of healing.
\b
\q1
\v 4 I said, “Yahweh, have mercy on me.
\q1 Heal my soul, because I’ve sinned against you.”
\q1
\v 5 My enemies speak evil against me, saying,
\q1 ‘When will he die and \add be forgotten\add*?’
\q1
\v 6 If \add my enemy\add* comes to see me, he speaks \add hollow words\add*.
\q1 \add He plots in his mind how to destroy me\add*.
\q1 When he leaves me, he tells \add others about it\add*.
\q1
\v 7 All who hate me, whisper together against me.
\q1 They plot \add how to make\add* trouble for me.
\q1
\v 8 They say, “An evil disease \add has badly affected\add* him.
\q1 Now that he’s \add down flat\add*, he’ll \add never get up again\add*.”
\q1
\v 9 Indeed, even my own close friend who I trusted,

\q1 has \add betrayed me\add*.
\q1
\v 10 But Yahweh, you have mercy on me and \add help\add* me up

\q1
\v 11 Because my enemy doesn’t defeat me,
\q1 that’s how I know that you’re pleased with me.
\q1
\v 12 As for me, you support me in my integrity
\q1 and will keep me \add in your mind\add* forever.
\q1
\v 13 May Israel’s God Yahweh be praised from everlasting to everlasting.

\q1
\v 1 As a deer thirsts for streams of water,

\q1
\v 2 My soul thirsts for God—for the living God.
\q1 When will I go and appear before God?
\q1
\v 3 My tears are my food day and night,
\q1 as people are \add asking\add* me every day, “Where’s your God?”
\q1
\v 4 These things I remember, and I pour out my soul within myself.
\q1 I travelled with the crowd and accompanied them to God’s residence
\q1 with shouts of joy and praise—a multitude celebrating a festival.
\q1
\v 5 Why are you bowed down, my soul,

\q1 Put your hope in God, because I’ll praise him again—
\q1 \add praise him for\add* \add how my God’s presence leads to my being saved\add*.
\q1
\v 6 My soul is bowed down within me,

\q1 and \add Mt.\add* Hermon’s \add heights\add* and from Mt. Mizar.
\q1
\v 7 Deep is calling to deep with the \add roar\add* of your waterfalls;

\q1
\v 8 During the day, Yahweh \add exercises\add* his loyal commitment,
\q1 and in the night, his song is with me—
\q1 a prayer to the God \add who gave me\add* life.
\q1
\v 9 I’ll \add ask\add* God, my \add place of safety\add*, “Why have you forgotten me?
\q1 Why do I walk around mourning because of an enemy’s oppression?”
\q1
\v 10 When those who’re hostile to me rebuke me, \add asking\add* me all day long, “Where’s your God?”
\q1 \add it feels like my bones are crushed\add*.
\q1
\v 11 My soul, why are you bowed down?

\d For the musical director: a song\f + \fr 44:0 \ft In Hebrew, ‘maskil’ is perhaps the name of this class of song.\f* by Korah’s descendants.
\q1
\v 1 God, we have listened with our ears.
\q1 Our ancestors have told us about \add the miracles\add* you did in their \add time\add*—in the old days.
\q1
\v 2 You drove out the \add other\add* nations \add with your power\add*, but you planted \add our ancestors\add*.
\q1 You \add caused suffering for other people groups\add*afflicted the peoples, but you sent \add our ancestors\add*.
\q1
\v 3 \add Yes,\add* they didn’t take over the land with their \add swords\add*, and their \add power\add* didn’t save them,
\q1 ^but \add it was your power and your direction\add*, because you were pleased with them.
\q1
\v 4 God, you are my king \add who\add* \add plans victories\add* for Yakob’s \add descendants\add*.
\q1
\v 5 Through you we will \add destroy\add* our adversaries.
\q1 In your name we will trample those who \add come\add* against us,
\q1
\v 6 because I won’t trust in my bow,
\q1 and my sword won’t save me.
\q1
\v 7 \add Yes,\add* you have saved us from our enemies,
\q1 and have \add humiliated\add* those who hate us.
\q1
\v 8 We’ve boasted in God every day,
\q1 and we will praise your name forever. \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*
\q1
\v 9 Yet you’ve rejected and humiliated us,
\q1 and you don’t go out with our armies.
\q1
\v 10 You made us turn back from the enemy,
\q1 and those who hate us take plunder for themselves.
\q1
\v 11 You’ve made us like sheep \add to be eaten\add*,
\q1 and you scattered us among the nations.
\q1
\v 12 You’ve sold your people for \add virtually nothing\add*—
\q1 You haven’t profitted from their sale.
\q1
\v 13 You’ve made us a reproach to our neighbours—
\q1 a contempt and a scorn to those around us.
\q1
\v 14 You made us an insult among the \add other\add* nations—
\q1 a shaking of the head among the peoples.
\q1
\v 15 My dishonour is \add on my mind\add* all day,
\q1 and my shame has overwhelmed me
\q1
\v 16 because of \add hearing those who\add* taunt and insult me—
\q1 facing those vengeful enemies.

\v 17 All of this has come against us,

\q1
\v 18 Our heart hasn’t turned back.
\q1 Our steps \add haven’t\add* strayed from your way.
\q1
\v 19 \add But\add* you’ve crushed us \add out\add* \add where the jackals live\add*,
\q1 and you’ve covered over us with dark blackness.
\q1
\v 20 If we’d forgotten the name of our God
\q1 and spread out our hands towards a foreign god,
\q2
\v 21 wouldn’t God have discovered that
\q1 because he \add even\add* knows our hearts’ secrets?
\q1
\v 22 Indeed, because of you we’re killed all day \add long\add*—
\q1 we’re considered to be like sheep to be slaughtered.
\q1
\v 23 My master, wake up. Why are you sleeping?
\q1 \add Do something\add*—don’t reject us forever.
\q1
\v 24 Why do you hide \add away\add*
\q1 and forget our oppression and suffering?
\q1
\v 25 \add Yes,\add* our life has sunk down into the dust—
\q1 \add it just as if\add* \add we’re lying face down\add* on the ground.

\v 26 \add Take action\add* as our helper
\q1 and \add buy our freedom for\add* us because of your loyal commitment.

\d For the musical director: a song by David from when the prophet Natan had gone to him after David had committed adultery with Bat-Sheva.
\q1
\v 1 Have mercy on me, God, because of your loyal commitment.
\q1 Blot out my disobedience, \add because you’re so merciful\add*.
\q1
\v 2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity
\q1 and make me clean from my sin
\q1
\v 3 because I’m \add aware of\add* my transgressions,
\q1 and my sin is always \add on my mind\add*.
\q1
\v 4 It’s you and only you that I’ve sinned against,
\q1 and done what’s evil in your sight.
\q1 You are right when you speak.
\q1 You are correct when you judge.
\q1
\v 5 \add Yes\add*, I was born in iniquity.
\q1 As soon as my mother conceived me, I was in sin.
\q1
\v 6 You desire \add integrity\add* in my inner self,
\q1 and you teach me wisdom in the secret place within.
\q1
\v 7 Purify me with \add blood (applied to the doorway with a sprig of\add* hyssop), and I’ll be clean.
\q1 Wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.
\q1
\v 8 Let me hear joy and gladness
\q1 →so that the bones that you’ve broken can be happy \add again\add*.
\q1
\v 9 \add Look away\add* from my sins
\q1 and blot out all my iniquities.
\q1
\v 10 Create a clean heart in me, God,
\q1 and renew an unwwavering spirit within me.
\q1
\v 11 Don’t drive me away from your presence,
\q1 and don’t take your holy spirit away from me.
\q1
\v 12 Restore to me the joy of your salvation,
\q1 and sustain me with a willing spirit.
\q1
\v 13 Then I’ll teach \add other\add* transgressors your ways,
\q1 and sinners will be converted to you.
\q1
\v 14 God of my salvation, forgive me for shedding blood,
\q1 →and I’ll \add happily shout about how good and righteous you are\add*.
\q1
\v 15 Open my lips, my master,
\q1 and my mouth will express praise to you
\q1
\v 16 because \add a sacrifice wouldn’t make you happy\add* or I would give it.
\q1 You get no pleasure from burnt offerings.
\q1
\v 17 The sacrifices \add that God wants\add* are a broken spirit—
\q1 a humbled and repentant heart won’t be despised by you, God.
\q1
\v 18 Express your pleasure at Tsiyyon \add (Zion)\add* by doing good \add to us\add*.
\q1 \add Re\add*build Yerushalem’s walls.
\q1
\v 19 Then you’ll delight in the sacrifices of righteousness,
\q1 in burnt offerings and completely burnt offerings.
\q1 Then \add our people\add* will offer bulls on your altar.

\s1 God’s judgement and mercy
\d For the musical director: a song\f + \fr 52:0 \ft In Hebrew, ‘maskil’ is perhaps the name of this class of song.\f* by David written when Doeg the Edomite reported to \add King\add* Shaul that, “David went there to Ahimilik.”
\q1
\v 1 Why are you proud of making trouble, \add you\add* powerful \add man\add*?
\q1 God’s loyal commitment comes every day.
\q1
\v 2 Your tongue plans destruction—
\q1 working deceitfully like a sharp razor.
\q1
\v 3 You love evil more than good
\q1 and lying rather than speaking \add the truth\add*. \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*
\q1
\v 4 You love \add saying anything that destroys other people\add*, \add you\add* deceitful tongue,
\q1
\v 5 ≈\add so\add* God will also destroy you forever.
\q1 He’ll snatch you up and pluck you out of your tent
\q1 and root you out of the land of the living. \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*
\q1
\v 6 \add Godly\add* \add people\add* will also see it and fear.
\q1 They’ll laugh at him \add and say\add*,
\q2
\v 7 “Look, that’s a man who didn’t \add rely on God for his protection\add*,
\q1 \add but\add* \add instead\add* trusted in the abundance of his wealth,
\q1 \add and\add* he was strong when he destroyed \add others\add*.”
\q1
\v 8 But as for me, I’m like a flourishing olive tree in God’s house.
\q1 I’ll trust in God’s loyal commitment forever.
\q1
\v 9 I’ll continually thank you for what you’ve done.
\q1 I’ll \add rely on your reputation\add*, because it’s good,

\q1 They are corrupt and have done disgusting acts of evil.
\q1 There’s no one who does good.\x + \xo 53:1-3: \xt Rom 3:10-12.\x*
\q1
\v 2 God looks down from heaven on the children of humanity
\q1 to see if there are any with insight—
\q1 who \add strive to obey\add* him.
\q1
\v 3 They’ve all turned away.
\q1 Together they have become corrupt.
\q1 There’s not one who does good, not even one.
\q1
\v 4 Do those who \add do evil\add* have no understanding—
\q1 those who devour my people as if they were eating bread,
\q1 and \add it’s not God that they trust in to help them\add*?
\q1
\v 5 They were \add very worried even though it was quite irrational\add*
\q1 because God will scatter the bones of \add any army that comes to attack\add* you.
\q1 \add Those people\add* will be put to shame because God has rejected them.
\q1
\v 6 If only Yisrael’s rescue would come from Tsiyyon.
\q1 When God brings his people back from the captivity,
\q1 then Yakov will celebrate
\q1 and Yisrael will be glad.

\q1 and \add use your power to declare me innocent\add*.
\q1
\v 2 Hear my prayer, God.
\q1 \add Listen to what I’m saying\add*
\q1
\v 3 because strangers have \add acted\add* against me,
\q1 and pitiless men have \add tried to eliminate me\add*.
\q1 They \add don’t have any respect for\add* God. \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*
\q1
\v 4 \add But yes\add*, God is my helper.
\q1 My master is the one who supports me.

\q1
\v 3 because of \add what my enemy is saying\add*.
\q1 \add Yes,\add* because of the oppression by wicked \add people\add*—
\q1 because they bring trouble on me and angrily persecute me.
\q1
\v 4 My \add stomach has gone into a knot\add*,
\q1 and \add thoughts of\add* death \add terrify\add* me.
\q1
\v 5 Fearfulness and trembling have \add hit\add* me,
\q1 and horror has overwhelmed me.
\q1
\v 6 I said, “Oh, if only I had wings like a dove
\q1 →then I’d fly away and \add find a peaceful place\add*.
\q1
\v 7 See, then I would wander far away.
\q1 I would stay in the wilderness. \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*
\q1
\v 8 I would hurry to a safe spot,
\q1 \add away\add* from the stormy wind and tempest.”
\q1
\v 9 Confuse them, my master, \add so their words don’t make sense\add*,
\q1 because I’ve seen violence and strife in the city.
\q1
\v 10 Day and night they \add wander around\add* \add the city\add* walls.
\q1 Wickedness and trouble are in the middle of it.
\q1
\v 11 Destruction is \add right there among\add* it,
\q1 and oppression and deceit never leave its marketplace,
\q1
\v 12 because it wasn’t an enemy who taunted me. (Then I could have borne it.)
\q1 It wasn’t my opponent who set himself up against me. (Then I would have hidden myself from him.)
\q1
\v 13 But it was you—a man \add of similar status\add* to myself.
\q1 My companion and close friend.
\q1
\v 14 We’d had \add good times\add* together.
\q1 We’d walked among the crowd in God’s residence.
\q1
\v 15 Let death \add hit\add* them suddenly.
\q1 Let them go down alive to Sheol,
\q1 because wickedness is where they live, right among them.
\q1
\v 16 As for me, I’ll \add trust God to help me\add*,
\q1 and Yahweh will save me.
\q1
\v 17 I complain and moan morning, noon, and evening.
\q1 →He will hear my voice.
\q1
\v 18 He’ll peacefully \add rescue\add* my life from \add those who\add* approach me,
\q1 because there’s many \add who fight\add* \add against\add* me.
\q1
\v 19 God, the one who’s \add ruled\add* from eternity, will hear them and answer them \add with what they deserve\add*. \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*
\q1 They never change, and they don’t \add respect\add* God.
\q1
\v 20 \add My friend\add* \add took action\add* against those who were at peace with him.
\q1 He hasn’t respected the agreement that \add we\add* had.
\q1
\v 21 His mouth was as smooth as butter, \add but\add* his heart was hostile.
\q1 His words were softer than oil, \add but\add* they were actually drawn swords.
\q1
\v 22 \add Give your problems to\add* Yahweh, and he’ll sustain you.
\q1 He’ll never allow a righteous person to \add be toppled\add*.
\q1
\v 23 \add But\add* you, God, will send the wicked down into the pit of destruction.
\q1 Bloodthirsty and deceitful people won’t live even half as long as others,
\q1 \add but\add* I will trust in you.

\q1
\v 1 God, you’re my God. I’m \add eager to get to know\add* you.
\q1 My \add inner being\add* thirsts for you, and my body \add needs\add* you
\q1 in a dry and \add depressing\add* land where there’s no water,
\q1
\v 2 so I’ve been to the sanctuary to see you—
\q1 to see your power and your splendour
\q1
\v 3 because your loyal commitment is better than life \add itself\add*.
\q1 My lips will praise you.
\q1
\v 4 So I will \add use my life to\add* bless you.
\q1 I will lift up my hands \add to honour you\add*.
\q1
\v 5 \add My mind\add* will be satisfied as if \add it’s had a good meal\add*.
\q1 My mouth will gladly praise you
\q1
\v 6 on my bed as I \add think about\add* you.
\q1 I will meditate about you during the night
\q1
\v 7 because you have helped me.
\q1 \add Under your protection\add*, I sing with happiness
\q1
\v 8 \add I stay close to you\add*—
\q1 \add you use your power to support me\add*.
\q1
\v 9 Those who’re trying to destroy \add me\add*
\q1 will \add end up\add* down deep under the earth \add instead\add*.
\q1
\v 10 They’ll \add experience the wrong end of\add* the sword—
\q1 they’ll \add become food\add* for jackals.
\q1
\v 11 \add But\add* the king will \add express his happiness\add* about God.
\q1 Everyone who trusts in \add God\add* will boast,
\q1 but \add he won’t allow liars to say anything\add*.

\s1 Trusting God for protection
\d For the musical director: a song by David.
\q1
\v 1 Hear my voice of complaint, God.
\q1 Save my from my enemies that I fear.
\q1
\v 2 Protect me from the secret plots of wicked people—
\q1 from the scheming of those who do evil.
\q1
\v 3 They have sharpened their tongues like swords.
\q1 They have targeted their bitter words \add like\add* aiming arrows
\q1
\v 4 to shoot at innocent people from their ambush—
\q1 they shoot suddenly and don’t fear \add any consequences\add*.
\q1
\v 5 They encourage \add each other\add* with their wicked \add plans\add*.
\q1 They talk about secretly laying their traps,
\q1 \add asking\add* who will \add notice\add* them.
\q1
\v 6 They plot crimes, conceiving the ‘perfect plan’.
\q1 Humankind’s inner \add thoughts\add* and \add desires run\add* deep.
\q1
\v 7 But God will shoot them—
\q1 suddenly they’ll be wounded by arrows.
\q1
\v 8 Their own tongues will bring them to ruin.
\q1 Everyone who sees them will \add just\add* shake \add their heads\add*.
\q1
\v 9 All of humankind will fear God
\q2 and talk about what he’s done.
\q1 \add Yes,\add* they’ll ponder \add what happened\add*.
\q1
\v 10 \add Those who do what is right\add* will be glad about Yahweh
\q2 and take shelter in him.
\q1 Every \add godly person will praise him\add*.

\q1
\v 10 You generously water its \add ploughed\add* furrows—
\q1 \add your rain\add* flattens down the ridges \add between them\add*.
\q1 You make \add the soil\add* soft with rain showers
\q1 \add then\add* you bless what grows there.
\q1
\v 11 You crown the \add yearly harvest\add* with your bounty,

\v 8 Be a blessing to God, you people groups.

\q1
\v 9 He maintains us among the living,

\q1
\v 10 For you, God, have tested us.
\q1 You’ve purified us like refined silver.
\q1
\v 11 You led us \add like fish\add* into a net.
\q1 You \add made us carry a heavy load\add* on our backs.
\q1
\v 12 You let \add enemy horse\add*men ride over our heads.
\q1 We went through fire and through water,
\q1 \add but\add* you brought us out to a \add wide-open\add* place.
\q1
\v 13 I will enter your \add temple\add* with burnt offerings.
\q1 I will \add give the amount that I promised\add*

\s1 A song of victory
\d For the musical director: a song by David.
\q1
\v 1 Let God \add take action so\add* his enemies get scattered.
\q1 Let those who hate him flee away from him
\q1
\v 2 like smoke is driven away.
\q1 Drive them away like wax melts \add beside a flame\add*,

\q1
\v 5 A father of the fatherless,
\q1 a \add protector\add* of the widows,
\q1 is God in the \add sin-free\add* place where he lives.
\q1
\v 6 God puts solitary \add people\add* into homes.
\q1 He brings out the prisoners \add to live in\add* prosperity,
\q1 but those who’re rebellious live in a dry, barren land.
\q1
\v 7 God, when you went out \add ahead of\add* your people,
\q1 you marched through the wilderness. \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*
\q1
\v 8 The earth trembled \add and\add* the skies also dropped rain in God’s presence—
\q1 in the presence of God at Sinai,
\q1 in the presence of Israel’s God.
\q1
\v 9 You sent plentiful rain around.
\q1 You strengthened your inheritance when it was famished.
\q1
\v 10 Your people lived in \add that land\add*.
\q1 You, God, gave to the poor out of your goodness.
\q1
\v 11 My master gave \add an order\add*
\q1 and a large army proclaimed it.
\q1
\v 12 Kings of armies flee—\add they take off\add*—
\q1 she who waits at home divides out the loot.
\q1
\v 13 Although you lie down \add out there\add* among the sheepfolds,
\q1 you’ll be like the wings of a dove covered with silver,
\q1 and her feathers \add covered\add* with yellow gold
\q1
\v 14 The powerful \add one\add* scattered kings there.
\q1 It was as when it snowed on Mt. Zalmon.
\q1
\v 15 Mt. Bashan is \add one of\add* God’s large \add mountains\add*.
\q1 The hill country of Bashan has many mountain peaks.
\q1
\v 16 Why do you look in envy, you high hill country,

\q1 Indeed, Yahweh will live \add in it\add* forever.
\q1
\v 17 God has \add many\add* thousands of chariots—thousands of thousands.
\q1 My master is among them in the sacred place,
\q2 like he was at Sinai.
\q1
\v 18 You have ascended on high.
\q1 You have led away captives.
\q1 You have received gifts from among men,
\q1 even from those who were rebellious,

\q1
\v 22 My master said, “I’ll bring my enemies back from Bashan.
\q1 I’ll bring them back from the depths of the ocean
\q2
\v 23 so that you can crush your enemies—dipping your foot in blood,
\q1 and so that your dogs’ tongues can have their share \add too\add* from your enemies.”
\q1
\v 24 People have seen your processions, God—
\q1 the processions of my God, my King, into the sacred place.
\q1
\v 25 The singers went first \add with the musicians behind them\add*,
\q1 and the girls playing tambourines were in the middle.
\q1
\v 26 Bless God in the large congregation.
\q1 Praise Yahweh, you who are from the fountain of Israel.
\q1
\v 27 First there’s Benyamin, the smallest tribe,
\q1 then the leaders of Yehudah with their large numbers,
\q1 \add then\add* the leaders of Zebulun and the leaders of Naphtali.
\q1
\v 28 \add Israel\add*, your God has predetermined your strength.
\q1 Reveal your power to us, God, as you have done in times past
\q1
\v 29 because of your temple in Yerushalem,
\q1 where kings bring \add gifts\add* to you.
\q1
\v 30 Shout in battle against the wild animals in the reeds,
\q1 against the peoples, that multitude of bulls and calves.
\q1 Humiliate them and make them bring you gifts.
\q1 Scatter the \add people groups\add* who love to \add attack other countries\add*.
\q1

\s1 A request for help
\d For the musical director: \add a song\add* by David \add to be sung to the tune of\add* ‘Lilies’.
\q1
\v 1 Save me, God, because the waters have reached my neck.
\q1
\v 2 I sink in deep mud where there’s nowhere to stand.
\q1 I have come into deep waters where the floods flow over me.
\q1
\v 3 I’m exhausted from my crying \add for help\add*—my throat is dry.
\q1 My eyes have failed while I’ve been waiting for my God.
\q1
\v 4 \add There’s more\add* \add people\add* who hate me \add without even knowing why\add*, than there are hairs on my head.
\q1 I have many enemies who want to destroy me, \add but\add* for no good reason.
\q1 I’m forced to ‘give back’ what I didn’t steal \add in the first place\add*.
\q1
\v 5 God, you know \add the silly things that I do\add*,
\q1 and none of my sins can be hidden from you.
\q1
\v 6 Don’t let those who hope in you be put to shame because of me, my master, army commander Yahweh.
\q1 Don’t let those who \add need your help\add* be humiliated because of me, God of Israel.
\q1
\v 7 I’ve \add been ridiculed for following you\add*—
\q1 shame has covered my face.
\q1
\v 8 I’ve become a stranger to my siblings—
\q1 \add yes,\add* a foreigner to my mother’s children
\q1
\v 9 because \add my\add* zeal for your \add temple\add* has eaten me up,
\q1 and the rebukes of those who rebuke you have fallen on me.
\q1
\v 10 When I wept and \add chose not to eat\add*,
\q1 \add they insulted\add* me.
\q1
\v 11 When I \add put on\add* \add rough\add* sackcloth,
\q1 \add they just turned me into a joke\add*.
\q1
\v 12 Those who sit around the \add community court\add* talk about me,
\q1 and \add drunkards sing about me\add*.
\q1
\v 13 \add Even so,\add* my prayer is to you, Yahweh,
\q1 \add when you’re feeling favourable towards me\add*.
\q1 \add From the strength of your loyal commitment\add*,
\q2 answer me \add for sure by rescuing me\add*.
\q1
\v 14 Pull me out of the mud, and don’t let me sink.
\q1 Rescue me from those who hate me, and from deep waters.
\q1
\v 15 Don’t let the floods of water overwhelm me,
\q2 or let the deep swallow me up.
\q1 Don’t let the pit close its mouth over me.
\q1
\v 16 Answer me, Yahweh, because your loyal commitment is good.
\q1 Turn to me because \add you’ve shown so much mercy towards me\add*.
\q1
\v 17 Don’t hide from \add me,\add* your servant.
\q1 Answer me quickly, because I’m in distress.
\q1
\v 18 Come to me and redeem me.
\q1 Ransom me because of my enemies.
\q1
\v 19 You know my rebuke, my shame, and my dishonour.
\q1 All my adversaries \add report my failings to\add* you.
\q1
\v 20 \add Their\add* \add insults\add* have broken my heart—I’m full of heaviness.
\q1 I looked for someone to take pity, but no one was there.
\q1 I looked for \add someone to encourage me\add*, but I didn’t find anyone.
\q1
\v 21 They gave me poison \add to eat\add*.
\q1 \add When I was thirsty\add*, they gave me vinegar to drink.
\q1
\v 22 Let their table become a snare \add to catch them in their own schemes\add*.
\q1 When they think they’re safe, let it become a trap.
\q1
\v 23 Let their eyes be darkened so they won’t be able to see anything,
\q1 and make their \add legs\add* continually shake.
\q1
\v 24 Pour your indignation out on them,
\q1 and let the fierceness of your anger overtake them.
\q1
\v 25 Let their place become uninhabited.
\q1 Don’t let anyone live in their tents
\q1
\v 26 because they persecuted the one you struck down.
\q1 They multiplied the pain of those that you had \add already\add* wounded.
\q1
\v 27 Add sin after sin to their \add record\add*.
\q1 Don’t let them \add try to tell you about their ‘innocence’\add*.
\q1
\v 28 Let them be blotted out of the book of \add life\add*
\q1 and not have \add their names\add* written down along with \add the names of\add* the godly.
\q1
\v 29 As for me, I’m suffering and in pain.
\q1 \add Yes\add* God, protect me and rescue me.
\q1
\v 30 I’ll praise God with a song
\q1 and with thankfulness, I’ll \add tell about his goodness\add*.
\q1
\v 31 That will please Yahweh better than \add sacrificing\add* a cow,
\q1 or a \add physical\add* bull that has horns and hooves.
\q1
\v 32 Humble \add people\add* will see it and be glad.
\q1 You who \add want to obey\add* God, let your hearts live
\q1
\v 33 because Yahweh listens to the poor,
\q1 and he doesn’t despise his \add people when they’re imprisoned\add*.
\q1
\v 34 Let heaven and earth praise him,
\q1 \add including\add* the seas and everything in them that moves.
\q1
\v 35 For God will save Tsiyyon \add (Zion)\add*
\q1 and will rebuild the cities of Yehudah.
\q1 The people will live there and have it \add for their own\add*.
\q1
\v 36 The descendants of his people will inherit it,
\q1 and those who love him will live there safely.

\q1
\v 9 Don’t throw me away in my time of old age.
\q1 Don’t abandon me when my strength fails,
\q1
\v 10 because my enemies are talking about me.
\q1 Those who watch for my life are plotting together.
\q1
\v 11 They say, “God’s abandoned him \add now\add*.
\q1 Pursue him and capture him, because there’s no one to rescue him.”
\q1

\q1 your power to everyone who is to come.
\q1
\v 19 \add Your justice and fairness is unable to be challenged\add*.
\q1 You who’ve done great things, God, who \add else\add* is like you?

\v 11 Indeed, may all kings \add bow down to\add* him.
\q1 May all nations serve him
\q1
\v 12 because he helps \add any\add* needy person who cries out
\q1 and the poor person who has no other helper.
\q1
\v 13 He has pity on the poor and needy,
\q1 and he saves the lives of needy people.
\q1
\v 14 He redeems their lives from oppression and violence.
\q1 Their \add life\add* is precious \add to him\add*.
\q1
\v 15 May he live—may Sheba’s gold be given to him.
\q1 May people always pray for him.
\q1 May God bless him all day \add long\add*.
\q1
\v 16 May there be abundance of grain in the land—on the mountaintops may their crops wave.

\s1 The need for justice
\d A song by Asaf.
\q1
\v 1 Surely God is good to Yisrael—
\q1 to those with pure \add motives\add*
\q1
\v 2 but as for me, my feet almost slipped.
\q1 My steps were caused to nearly \add slide out from under me\add*
\q1
\v 3 because I was envious of arrogant \add people\add*
\q1 when I saw \add how wicked people prosper\add*,
\q1
\v 4 because they \add live without pains\add*
\q1 and their \add bodies are strong and healthy\add*.
\q1
\v 5 They are free from \add normal human struggles\add*,
\q1 and they \add don’t suffer along with everyone else\add*.
\q1
\v 6 Therefore pride is a necklace for them—
\q1 violence covers them \add like a coat\add*.
\q1
\v 7 Their eyes bulge out from their fatness.
\q1 \add Their heads are full of imaginative\add* \add schemes\add*.
\q1
\v 8 They mock and speak with oppressive evil.
\q1 They speak from an elevated place.\f + \fr 73:8 \ft It’s not clear from the Hebrew, if this refers to somewhere physical, or to an attitude like ‘arrogance’.\f*
\q1
\v 9 They set their mouth in the heavens,
\q1 and their tongue goes through the earth.\f + \fr 73:9 \ft Left literal because meaning/application is unclear.\f*
\q1
\v 10 Therefore his people turn here,
\q1 and full waters are drained in/by them.\f + \fr 73:10 \ft Left literal because meaning/application is unclear.\f*
\q1
\v 11 Then they say, “How does God know?
\q1 \add Does the highest one notice what’s going on\add*?”
\q1
\v 12 Look at these wicked \add people\add*.
\q1 They’re always at ease—increasing in wealth.
\q1
\v 13 Surely \add I wasted my time keeping my mind pure\add*
\q1 and washing my hands in innocence,
\q1
\v 14 because I’ve been stricken throughout the day,
\q1 and punished every morning.
\b
\q1
\v 15 If I’d said that I’d speak like that,
\q1 wow, I would have betrayed your children’s generation.
\q1
\v 16 And when I thought about how to understand this,
\q1 \add it was very difficult for me to figure it out\add*
\q1
\v 17 until I went into God’s sanctuaries,
\q1 then I discerned their end.
\b
\q1
\v 18 Surely you put them onto slippery places.
\q1 You make them fall to destruction.
\q1
\v 19 How they are \add brought down\add* to \add nothing\add* as in a moment.
\q1 They’re finished—they come to a terrifying end
\q1
\v 20 My master, when you rouse yourself, you’ll despise their image,
\q1 like a dream after \add the person wakes up\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 21 When my heart was embittered,
\q1 and \add my organs felt like they had a knife in them\add*,
\q1
\v 22 I was stupid and \add ignorant\add*.
\q1 I \add acted\add* toward you \add like\add* an animal.
\q1
\v 23 Yet I’m with you continuously—
\q1 you take hold of my right hand.
\q2
\v 24 You guide me with your counsel,
\q1 and afterward you’ll receive me with honour.
\q1
\v 25 Who \add else\add* do I have I in heaven \add to help me\add* other than you?
\q1 And there’s nothing on the earth that I desire \add more than\add* you.
\q1
\v 26 My \add muscles\add* and my heart fail,
\q1 but God is the \add strength\add* of my heart and my \add fulfilment\add* forever.
\q1
\v 27 \add Yes, listen\add*, those who’re far from you \add must\add* die.
\q1 You destroy every one who’s unfaithful to you.
\q1
\v 28 As for me, approaching God is good for me.
\q1 I have made my master Yahweh my \add safe place\add*
\q1 so that I can tell \add everyone\add* \add about what you’ve done\add*.
\c 74
\s1 Requesting God’s help
\d A song\f + \fr 74:0 \ft In Hebrew, ‘maskil’, is perhaps the name of this class of song.\f* by Asaf.
\q1
\v 1 Why God, have you rejected \add us\add* forever?
\q1 Why \add are you so angry at\add* the sheep in your pasture?
\q1
\v 2 Remember your congregation that you aquired in times \add past\add*,
\q1 which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance.
\q1 This Mt. Tsiyyon \add (Zion)\add*, where you’ve lived.
\q1
\v 3 \add Take\add* your feet \add to see\add* the perpetual ruins.
\q1 All the \add damage\add* that the enemy has done to the sanctuary.
\q1
\v 4 Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your meeting place.
\q1 They’ve set up their banners as signs.
\q1
\v 5 \add They acted like men chopping down a forest with\add* axes.
\q1
\v 6 And now, with axe and hammers,
\q1 they \add smash up\add* all its \add carved\add* \add panels\add*.
\q1
\v 7 They have \add burnt\add* your sanctuary to the ground.
\q1 They have profaned the place \add where your name is attached\add*.
\q1
\v 8 They said in their hearts, “We’ll \add totally crush\add* them.”
\q1 They’ve burnt all of the meeting places of God in the \add country\add*.
\q1
\v 9 \add There aren’t any signs for us to watch\add*.
\q1 There’s no longer any prophet,
\q1 and there’s no one among us who knows how long this will last.
\q1
\v 10 \add How much longer\add*, God, will the enemy \add be able to mock for\add*?
\q1 Will the enemy \add be able to\add* treat your name with contempt forever?
\q1
\v 11 Why do you withdraw your hand \add of power\add*?
\q1 Take it \add out of your pocket\add* and destroy them.
\q1
\v 12 Yet God is my king from times \add past\add*,
\q1 \add rescuing us in a range of locations\add*.
\q1
\v 13 You divided the sea by your strength.
\q1 You smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.
\q1
\v 14 You crushed the sea dragon’s heads.\x + \xo 74:14 \xt Job 41:1-34.\x*
\q1 You fed him to those living in the wilderness.
\q1
\v 15 You broke open springs and streams.
\q1 You dried up flowing rivers.
\q1
\v 16 The day is yours, and the night is also yours.
\q1 You set the sun and \add moon\add* in place.
\q1
\v 17 You have set all the borders of the earth.
\q1 You have made summer and winter.
\q1
\v 18 Call to mind how the enemy hurled insults at you, Yahweh,
\q1 and that a foolish nation has \add belittled\add* your name.
\q1
\v 19 Don’t \add just allow a wild animal to take your dove’s life\add*.
\q1 Don’t forget the life of your oppressed people forever.
\q1
\v 20 Remember your \add promises as part of our\add* agreement,
\q1 because the dark regions of the \add country\add* are full of places of violence.
\q1
\v 21 Don’t let the oppressed be turned back in shame.
\q1 Let the poor and oppressed \add have good reason to\add* praise \add you\add*.
\q1
\v 22 \add Take action\add*, God; defend your own honour.
\q1 \add Take notice of\add* how fools insult you all day \add long\add*.
\q1
\v 23 Don’t forget the voice of your enemies
\q1 or the uproar of those who continually defy you.

\s1 God the judge
\d For the musical director: a song by Asaf to be sung to the tune of ‘Don’t destroy’.
\q1
\v 1 We give thanks to you, God.
\q1 We thank \add you\add* \add because you reveal your presence\add*.
\q1 People \add talk about the amazing things you’ve done\add*.
\q1
\v 2 At the appointed time I will judge fairly.
\q1
\v 3 Although the earth and all \add its\add* inhabitants shake in fear,
\q1 I’ll steady the earth’s \add foundations\add*. \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*
\q1
\v 4 I told the arrogant, “Stop bragging,”
\q1 and the wicked, “Don’t \add blow your own trumpet\add*.
\q1
\v 5 Don’t \add raise your head\add* \add ready to charge\add*.
\q1 Don’t speak with \add your nose in the air\add*.”
\q1
\v 6 It’s not from the east or from the west,
\q1 and it is not from the wilderness that lifting up comes
\q2
\v 7 because God is the judge.
\q1 He brings one down one and lifts up another
\q1
\v 8 because Yahweh has a full cup of foaming wine mixed with spices
\q1 that he holds in his hand and pours it out.
\q1 Surely all the wicked \add people\add* across the earth will drink it to the last drop.
\q1
\v 9 \add But\add* I will continually talk about what you’ve done;
\q1 I’ll sing praises to Yakov’s God.
\q1
\v 10 He says, “I’ll \add destroy the power\add* of the wicked,
\q1 but will \add increase the strength\add* of the righteous.”
\c 76
\s1 God is victorious
\d For the musical director: a song by Asaf \add to be accompanied by\add* stringed instruments.
\q1
\v 1 God has made himself known in Yehudah \add (Judah)\add*.
\q1 His \add reputation\add* is great in Yisrael \add (Israel)\add*.
\q1
\v 2 His tent is in Salem.
\q1 His residence is in Tsiyyon \add (Zion)\add*.
\q1
\v 3 There he broke the arrows that were for the bow,
\q1 the shield, the sword, and the other weapons of war. \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*
\q1
\v 4 You shine brightly and reveal your \add splendour\add*,
\q1 above the hills \add where you killed your victims\add*.
\q1
\v 5 The brave \add warriors\add* were plundered.
\q1 They slept their \add last\add* sleep.
\q1 All the \add warriors\add* were \add helpless\add*.
\q1
\v 6 At your rebuke, God of Yakov,
\q1 both rider and horse fell asleep.
\q1
\v 7 You, yes you, are to be feared.
\q1 Who can stand in your sight when you are angry?
\q1
\v 8 You made your judgement heard from heaven.
\q1 The earth was afraid and silent
\q2
\v 9 when you, God, \add took action\add* to execute judgement
\q1 and to save all oppressed \add people\add* \add across the world\add*. \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*
\q1
\v 10 Surely your angry judgement against humanity will bring you praise.
\q1 You \add cloak\add* yourself with what’s left of your anger.
\q1
\v 11 Make promises to your God Yahweh, then keep them.
\q1 May all who surround him bring gifts to him who \add expects to be obeyed\add*.
\q1
\v 12 He humbles the spirit of the princes.
\q1 He’s feared by the kings \add across the world\add*.
\c 77
\s1 God’s leadership
\d For the musical director: a song for Yedutun by Asaf.
\q1
\v 1 I will call out to God with my voice.
\q1 I’ll call with my voice to God, and my God will hear me.
\q1
\v 2 \add When I had troubles\add*, I \add asked my master for help\add*.
\q1 At night I stretched my hands out, and they didn’t get tired.
\q1 \add The knot in my stomach wouldn’t go away\add*.
\q1
\v 3 I thought of God as I groaned.
\q1 I thought about him as I grew faint. \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*
\q1
\v 4 You held my eyes open.
\q1 I was too troubled to speak.
\q1
\v 5 I thought about the days of old,
\q1 about times long past.
\q1
\v 6 I call my song to remembrance in the night.
\q1 I meditate within my heart,
\q1 and my spirit makes searches around diligently.
\q1
\v 7 Will my master reject me forever?
\q1 Will he never again show me favour?
\q1
\v 8 Was his loyal commitment gone forever?
\q1 Had his promise failed forever?
\q1
\v 9 Had God forgotten to be gracious?
\q1 Had his anger \add masked\add* his compassion? \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*
\q1
\v 10 I said, “This is \add what saddens me\add*:
\q1 →the highest \add one\add* \add no longer using his power\add* \add to help\add* us.”
\q1
\v 11 \add But\add* I will call to mind \add what you’ve done previously\add*, Yahweh.
\q1 I will think about \add the wonderful things that you did in the past\add*.
\q1
\v 12 I will ponder all your activities
\q1 and will reflect on them.
\q1
\v 13 Your way, God, is \add without imperfection\add*.
\q1 What god compares to our \add terrrific\add* God?
\q1
\v 14 You are the God who does miracles.
\q1 You’ve revealed your strength among the peoples.
\q1
\v 15 You gave your people victory by \add use of\add* your great power—
\q1 the descendants of Yakov and Yosef. \qs (Instrumental break.)\qs*
\q1
\v 16 The waters saw you, God.
\q1 The waters saw you, and they were afraid.
\q1 The \add ocean\add* depths trembled.
\q1
\v 17 The clouds poured down water.
\q1 The cloudy skies also emitted \add a thunderous\add* sound.
\q1 Your arrows \add of lightning\add* flew about.
\q1
\v 18 Your thunderous voice was heard in the wind.
\q1 The lightning lit up the world.
\q1 The earth trembled and shook.
\q1
\v 19 Your path went through the sea
\q1 and your trail through the surging waters,
\q1 but your footprints couldn’t be seen.
\q1
\v 20 You led your people like a flock
\q1 \add under the supervision\add* of Mosheh and Aharon \add (Moses and Aaron)\add*.
\c 78
\s1 God’s past goodness
\d A song\f + \fr 78:0 \ft In Hebrew, ‘maskil’ is perhaps the name of this class of song.\f* by Asaf.
\q1
\v 1 Hear my teaching, my people.
\q1 Listen to \add what I’m saying\add*.
\q1
\v 2 I will \add speak out\add* in parables;
\q1 I will sing about hidden things about the past.
\q2
\v 3 These are things that we have heard and learnt—
\q1 things that our ancestors have told us.
\q1
\v 4 We won’t keep them from their descendants.
\q1 We’ll tell the next generation about Yahweh’s praiseworthy actions,
\q1 his strength, and the \add miracles\add* that he has done.
\q1
\v 5 \add Also\add* he established a rule in Yakov
\q1 and appointed a law in Yisrael.
\q1 He commanded our ancestors
\q1 →that they were to teach them to their children.
\q1
\v 6 He commanded this so that the generation to come might know his decrees—
\q1 the children not yet born who should tell them in turn to their own children.
\q1
\v 7 Then they would place their hope in God
\q1 and not forget \add what he’s done\add*
\q1 but \add obey\add* his commands.
\q1
\v 8 Then they would not be like their ancestors,
\q1 \add who were\add* a stubborn and rebellious generation—
\q1 a generation who \add didn’t control their\add* hearts,
\q1 and whose spirits were not committed and faithful to God.
\q1
\v 9 The Efraimites had \add many\add* archers,
\q1 but they turned back on the day of battle.
\q1
\v 10 They didn’t keep \add their\add* agreement with God,
\q1 and they refused to \add obey\add* his law.
\q1
\v 11 They forgot \add about what he’d done\add*—
\q1 the wonderful things that he had shown them.
\q1
\v 12 They forgot the marvellous things that he’d done
\q1 in the sight of their ancestors in Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add* in the Tsoan region.
\q1
\v 13 He divided the sea and led them across it.
\q1 He made the \add water on each side\add* stand up like walls.
\q1
\v 14 In the daytime he led them with a cloud,
\q1 ^and \add throughout\add* the night with the light from fire.
\q1
\v 15 He split the rocks in the wilderness,
\q1 and he gave them \add plenty of\add* water—\add enough to fill the ocean\add*.
\q1
\v 16 He made streams flow out of the rock
\q1 and made the water flow like rivers.
\q1
\v 17 \add Yet\add* they continued to sin against him,
\q1 rebelling against the highest \add one\add* in the wilderness.
\q1
\v 18 They challenged God in their hearts
\q1 by asking for food to satisfy their appetites.
\q1
\v 19 They spoke against God, saying,
\q1 “Can God really lay out \add food on\add* a table for us in the wilderness?
\q1
\v 20 See, when he struck the rock, \add water\add* gushed out
\q1 and streams overflowed.
\q1 But can he give food also?
\q1 Will he provide meat for his people?”
\q1
\v 21 When Yahweh heard that, he was angry
\q1 and his fire burned against Yakov.
\q1 His anger attacked Yisrael,
\q1
\v 22 because they didn’t believe in God
\q1 and didn’t trust \add that he would save them\add*.
\q1
\v 23 Yet he commanded the skies above
\q1 and opened the doors in the sky.
\q2
\v 24 He rained down manna for them to eat.
\q1 He gave them the grain from heaven.
\q1
\v 25 People ate angels’ bread.
\q1 He sent them plenty of food.
\q1
\v 26 He caused the east wind to blow in the sky,
\q1 and by his power he guided the south wind.
\q1
\v 27 He rained meat down on them like dust—
\q1 →birds as numerous as the sand \add on the seashore\add*.
\q1
\v 28 They fell in the middle of their camp—
\q1 all around their tents.
\q1
\v 29 So they ate and were full.
\q1 He gave them what they craved.
\q1
\v 30 \add But\add* they hadn’t filled \add their stomachs\add* yet—
\q1 their food was still in their mouths
\q2
\v 31 and then God’s anger attacked them
\q1 and killed the strongest of them.
\q1 He brought down Yisrael’s young men.
\q1
\v 32 Despite that, they continued to sin
\q1 and \add wouldn’t trust in the wonderful things he would do\add*.
\q1
\v 33 \add So\add* their days were ended uselessly.
\q1 Their years were filled with terror.
\q1
\v 34 Whenever God afflicted them, they would start to search for him,
\q1 and they would return and earnestly look for him.
\q1
\v 35 They would call to mind that God was their \add security\add*
\q1 and that the highest God was their rescuer.
\q1
\v 36 But they’d flatter him with their mouth,
\q1 and lie to him with their words.
\q1
\v 37 Their hearts weren’t firmly fixed on him,
\q1 and they weren’t faithful to his agreement.
\q1
\v 38 Yet he, being merciful, forgave their \add disobedience\add* and didn’t destroy them.
\q1 \add Yes,\add* many times he held back his anger
\q1 and didn’t stir up all his rage.
\q1
\v 39 He called to mind that they were \add only\add* made of flesh—
\q1 a \add breath of\add* wind that passes away and doesn’t return.
\q1
\v 40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,
\q1 and grieved him in \add those\add* barren regions.
\q1
\v 41 Again and again they \add challenged\add* God
\q1 and offended the holy \add one\add* of Israel.
\q1
\v 42 They didn’t think about his power,
\q1 \add or\add* \add about\add* how he’d rescued them from \add their\add* enemy,
\q1
\v 43 when he performed his miracles in Egypt
\q1 and his wonders in the Tsoan region.
\q1
\v 44 He turned the Egyptians’ rivers into blood
\q1 so that they couldn’t drink from their streams.
\q1
\v 45 He sent swarms of flies that \add bit\add* them
\q1 and frogs that overran their land.
\q1
\v 46 He gave their crops to the \add grasshoppers\add*
\q1 and \add the results of\add* their labour to the \add locusts\add*.
\q1
\v 47 He destroyed their grapevines with hail
\q1 and their sycamore fig trees with frost.
\q1
\v 48 He rained hail on their cattle
\q1 and hurled lightning bolts at their livestock.
\q1
\v 49 The fierceness of his anger lashed out against them.
\q1 He sent rage, fury, and trouble
\q1 like agents to bring disaster.
\q1
\v 50 He leveled a path for his anger.
\q1 He didn’t spare them from death
\q1 but gave them over to the plague.
\q1
\v 51 He killed all the firstborn in Egypt—
\q1 the firstborn of their \add reproductive\add* strength in Ham’s tents.
\q1
\v 52 He led his own people out like sheep
\q1 and guided them through the wilderness like a flock.
\q1
\v 53 He led them secure and unafraid,
\q1 \add but\add* the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
\q1
\v 54 Then he brought them to the border of his holy land—
\q1 to this mountain that he acquired \add with his power\add*.
\q1
\v 55 He drove out the nations ahead of them
\q1 and assigned them their inheritance.
\q1 He settled the Israeli tribes in their tents.\x + \xo 78:55: \xt Josh 11:16-23.\x*
\q1
\v 56 \add Yet\add* they challenged and defied the highest God
\q1 and didn’t \add obey\add* his solemn commands.
\q1
\v 57 They were unfaithful and acted treacherously like their ancestors.
\q1 They were as unreliable as a faulty bow.
\q1
\v 58 They made him angry with their \add hilltop shrines\add*
\q1 and provoked him to jealous anger with their idols.
\q1
\v 59 When God heard this, he was angry
\q1 and completely rejected Israel.
\q1
\v 60 He abandoned the sanctuary at Shiloh—
\q1 the tent where he had lived among people.\x + \xo 78:60: \xt Josh 18:1; Jer 7:12-14; 26:6.\x*
\q1
\v 61 He allowed his strength\f + \fr 78:61 \ft Probably referring to the sacred chest containing the tablets with the Sinai agreement written on them. But there’s also connotations of Shimshon’s/Samson’s capture in this line.\f* to be captured
\q1 and gave \add control of his splendour to the enemy\add*.
\q1
\v 62 He handed his people over to the sword,
\q1 and he was angry with his heritage.
\q1
\v 63 Fire devoured their young men,
\q1 and their young women had no wedding songs.
\q1
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword,
\q1 and their widows \add had no opportunity to\add* weep.
\q1
\v 65 Then my master awakened like someone who’d been asleep—
\q1 like a warrior who shouts because \add he’s been drinking\add*.
\q1
\v 66 He drove his opponents back.
\q1 He put them to perpetual shame.
\q1
\v 67 He rejected Yosef’s tent,
\q1 and he didn’t chose the tribe of Efraim.
\q1
\v 68 He chose the tribe of Yehudah

\v 1 God, foreign nations have come into \add the land you gave as an\add* inheritance.
\q1 They have defiled your holy temple.
\q1 They have turned Yerushalem \add (Jerusalem)\add* into a heap of ruins.
\q1
\v 2 They have given the dead bodies of your servants as food to the birds in the skies—
\q1 the bodies of your faithful ones to the animals on the ground.
\q1
\v 3 They’ve shed their blood around Yerushalem like water,
\q1 and there wasn’t anyone to bury them.
\q1
\v 4 We have become a reproach for our neighbours—
\q1 mocked and scorned by those around us.
\q1
\v 5 How long, Yahweh? Will you stay angry forever?
\q1 For how long will your jealous anger burn like fire?
\q1
\v 6 Pour out your rage on the nations that don’t know you
\q1 and on the kingdoms that don’t \add pray to you\add*,
\q1
\v 7 because they’ve devoured Yakov \add (Jacob/Israel)\add*
\q1 and destroyed his villages.
\q1
\v 8 Don’t hold the sins of our ancestors against us.
\q1 May \add we experience your acts of mercy\add*, because we’re very \add discouraged\add*.
\q1
\v 9 Help us, God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of your name.
\q1 Save us and forgive our sins for the sake of your \add reputation\add*.
\q1
\v 10 Why should the nations say, “Where is their God?”
\q1 Let your servants’ blood that was shed
\q1 be avenged on the nations before our eyes.
\q1
\v 11 May the groans of the prisoners come before you.
\q1 Keep \add those condemned to\add* death alive with the greatness of your power.
\q1
\v 12 Pay back seven times as much into the laps of our neighbouring countries
\q1 as \add repayment for\add* the insults with which they have insulted you, Lord.
\q1
\v 13 So we your people, and sheep of your pasture,
\q1 will give you thanks forever.

\q1 and its shoots to the \add Euphrates\add* River.
\q1

\q1 →so that all who pass by along the road pick its fruit?
\q1

\q1 and the animals in the countryside feed on it.

\q1
\v 38 But you have refused and rejected—
\q1 you’ve been angry with your anointed king.
\q1
\v 39 You have renounced the agreement with your servant.
\q1 You have desecrated his crown in the dust.
\q1
\v 40 You have broken down all his walls.

\q1
\v 41 Everyone who goes past on the road rob him.
\q1 He’s become an object of disgust to his neighbours.
\q1
\v 42 You have \add given strength to\add* his enemies;

\q1
\v 1 My master, you’ve been our \add protection\add*
\q1 throughout all generations.
\q1
\v 2 Before the mountains were formed or you formed the earth and the world,
\q1 from \add the entire past through to all the future\add*, you are God.
\q1
\v 3 You return man to dust,
\q1 and you say, “Return, you descendants of humanity,”
\q1
\v 4 because a thousand years in your sight
\q1 are \add just\add* like yesterday when it’s over,
\q1 and like a watch \add of several hours\add* in the night.
\q1
\v 5 You sweep them away as with a flood and they sleep.
\q1 In the morning they are like the grass that sprouts up:
\q1
\v 6 In the morning it blooms and grows up,
\q1 \add but\add* by the evening, it has withered and dried up.
\q1
\v 7 Certainly we’re consumed in your anger,
\q1 and in your rage we’re terrified.
\q1
\v 8 You’ve placed our \add disobedience in front of\add* you—
\q1 our hidden sins in the light of your presence,
\q1
\v 9 because our life passes away under your rage—
\q1 our years pass quickly like a sigh \add does\add*.
\q1
\v 10 \add We might reach the age of\add* seventy,
\q1 or even eighty if we’re healthy,
\q1 but even our best years are marked by trouble and sorrow.
\q1 Yes, they pass quickly, then we ‘fly away’.
\q1
\v 11 Who knows the intensity of your anger,
\q1 and your rage that’s equal to the \add respect that we should have had for\add* you?
\q1
\v 12 So teach us to consider \add the fragility of\add* our \add lives\add*
\q1 so that we might live wisely.
\q1
\v 13 Turn back, Yahweh.
\q1 How long will \add this last\add*?
\q1 Have pity on your servants.

\v 14 Satisfy us in the morning with your loyal commitment
\q1 so that we can celebrate and be glad for the rest of our lives.

\q1
\v 16 Let your servants see your \add actions\add*,
\q1 and let our children \add see\add* your splendour.

\q1
\v 6 \add You won’t be afraid\add* of the \add forces\add* that \add roam around\add* in the darkness,

\q1
\v 7 A thousand \add warriors\add* might fall \add dead\add* at your side,

\q1 they didn’t believe his \add promise\add*.
\q1
\v 25 \add Instead\add* they grumbled in their tents
\q1 and didn’t listen to \add what Yahweh said\add*.
\q1
\v 26 \add So he made his decision against\add* them:
\q1 that they’d drop \add dead there\add* in the wilderness,
\q2
\v 27 and he’d disperse their descendants across many countries\x + \xo 106:27: \xt Lev 26:33.\x*
\q1 and scatter them in \add distant\add* lands.
\b
\q1
\v 28 They \add submitted\add* to the Baal of Peor,\x + \xo 106:28-31: \xt Num 25:1-13.\x*
\q1 and ate sacrifices \add that had been offered to\add* the dead.
\q1
\v 29 They provoked him to anger with their actions,
\q1 and a plague broke out among them.
\q1
\v 30 Then Pinehas \add took a stand\add* and intervened
\q1 and stopped the plague.
\q1
\v 31 That \add godly action\add* was credited to him,
\q1 \add for all the generations to come\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 32 They also made Yahweh angry at the Merivah springs,\x + \xo 106:32-33: \xt Num 20:2-13.\x*
\q1 and \add that led to trouble for\add* Mosheh \add (Moses)\add*,
\q1
\v 33 because they’d rebelled against his spirit,
\q1 and then he \add ended up\add* speaking rashly.
\b
\q1
\v 34 They didn’t destroy those people groups\x + \xo 106:34-36: \xt Jdg 2:1-3; 3:5-6.\x*
\q1 as Yahweh had \add told them to do\add*.
\q1
\v 35 \add Instead\add* they mingled with \add those\add* other groups,
\q1 and imitated their \add ungodly\add* activities
\q1
\v 36 and worshipped their idols
\q1 \add which then became the reason for their destruction\add*.
\q1
\v 37 They sacrificed their sons and daughters to the demons.\x + \xo 106:37: \xt 2Ki 17:17.\x*
\q1
\v 38 \add Yes,\add* they shed innocent blood—\x + \xo 106:38: \xt Num 35:33.\x*
\q1 the blood of their sons and daughters
\q1 that they sacrificed to the idols and polluted the land with blood.
\q1
\v 39 Their actions \add made them unacceptable to worship God\add*,
\q1 having prostituted themselves \add to other Gods\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 40 So Yahweh got angry with his \add own\add* people,\x + \xo 106:40-46: \xt Jdg 2:14-18.\x*
\q1 and he despised his own inheritance.
\q1
\v 41 He \add allowed other countries to control\add* them,
\q1 and those who hated them ruled over them.
\q1
\v 42 Their enemies oppressed them,
\q1 and subdued them under their \add control\add*.
\q1
\v 43 He rescued them many times,
\q1 but they kept rebelling in their \add minds\add*,
\q1 and were brought down by their \add own\add* sin.
\q1
\v 44 \add Nevertheless,\add* he \add paid attention\add* to their distress
\q1 when he heard their cry \add for help\add*.
\q1
\v 45 He \add thought about\add* his agreement with them,

\q1
\v 46 He \add caused\add* their conquerors to \add have pity\add* on them.
\b
\q1
\v 47 Save us Yahweh our God,\x + \xo 106:47-48: \xt 1Ch 16:35-36.\x*

\s1 Thanking for God’s goodness
\q1
\v 1 Give thanks to Yahweh, because he’s good,
\q1 and his loyal commitment endures forever.
\q1
\v 2 Let \add the people who’ve been redeemed by\add* Yahweh speak out—
\q1 those he’s rescued from the enemy’s \add control\add*.
\q1
\v 3 He has gathered them \add back from\add* foreign lands,
\q1 from the east and from the west,
\q1 from the north and from the south.
\q1
\v 4 They wandered through the wilderness on a desert road
\q1 and found no city \add that they could settle in\add*.
\q1
\v 5 They were hungry and thirsty—
\q1 \add fading away\add* \add from exhaustion\add*.
\q1
\v 6 Then they called out to Yahweh in their \add time of\add* trouble,
\q1 →and he rescued them out of their distress.
\q1
\v 7 He led them by a direct path
\q1 so that they could go to a city to live in.
\q1
\v 8 Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his loyal commitment
\q1 and for the amazing things he’s done for humanity,
\q1
\v 9 because he satisfies \add the longings of those who thirst\add*,
\q1 and the desires of those who hunger, he fills up with good things.
\q1
\v 10 Some sat in darkness and in gloom—
\q1 prisoners chained up and experiencing suffering.
\q1
\v 11 This was because they had rebelled against God’s messages
\q1 and rejected the highest \add one’s\add* instructions.
\q1
\v 12 He \add used hardships to humble them\add*.
\q1 They stumbled and there wasn’t anyone to help them up.
\q1
\v 13 Then they called out to Yahweh in their \add time of\add* trouble,
\q1 and he rescued them out of their distress.
\q1
\v 14 He broke off their chains
\q1 and brought them out of darkness and gloom.
\q1
\v 15 Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his loyal commitment
\q1 and for the amazing things he’s done for humanity,
\q1
\v 16 because he’s broken the bronze gates
\q1 and cut through the iron bars.
\q1
\v 17 They were foolish in their rebellious ways
\q1 and \add made to suffer\add* because of their sins.
\q1
\v 18 They lost their desire to eat any food,
\q1 and they came close to death’s gates.
\q1
\v 19 Then they called out to Yahweh in their \add time of\add* trouble,
\q1 and he rescued them out of their distress.
\q1
\v 20 He sent his message and healed them,
\q1 and he rescued them from their destruction.
\q2
\v 21 Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his loyal commitment
\q1 and for the amazing things he’s done for humanity.
\q1
\v 22 Let them offer thanksgiving sacrifices
\q1 and \add write songs about what he’s done\add*.
\q1
\v 23 Some travel across the ocean in ships
\q1 and do business overseas.
\q1
\v 24 Those \add people\add* saw Yahweh’s activities
\q1 and his miracles on the oceans,
\q1
\v 25 because he \add spoke\add* \add out his command\add*
\q1 and aroused the windstorm that stirred up the waves.
\q1
\v 26 \add Their ships\add* \add reached\add* up to the sky,
\q1 \add then\add* they \add sunk\add* down \add into the troughs\add*.
\q1 Their \add courage\add* melted away in anguish.
\q1
\v 27 They swayed and staggered like drunkards
\q1 and \add had run out of sensible ideas\add*.
\q1
\v 28 Then they called out to Yahweh in their \add time of\add* trouble,
\q1 and he rescued them out of their distress.
\q1
\v 29 He calmed the storm,
\q1 and the waves were stilled.
\q1
\v 30 Then they celebrated because \add it had quietened down\add*,
\q1 so he brought them to their desired harbour.
\q1
\v 31 Oh that people would praise Yahweh for his loyal commitment
\q1 and for the amazing things that he’s done for humanity.
\q1
\v 32 Let them \add speak about his goodness to\add* the people’s assembly
\q1 and praise him at the council of the elders.
\q1
\v 33 He turns rivers into wilderness,
\q1 and springs of water into dry land,
\q1
\v 34 and a prosperous land into a barren place
\q1 because of the wickedness of those who live there.
\q1
\v 35 He turns the wilderness into a pool
\q1 and dry land into springs of water.
\q1
\v 36 He settles the hungry there,
\q1 and they build a city to live in.
\q1
\v 37 They sow fields and plant vineyards,
\q1 so that they can bring in a \add profitable\add* harvest.
\q1
\v 38 He blesses them so they are very numerous.
\q1 He doesn’t let their cattle decrease in number.
\q1
\v 39 They \add became less in number and status\add*
\q1 \add through\add* painful distress and suffering.
\q2
\v 40 He pours contempt on the leaders
\q1 and makes them wander in the wilderness where there’s no roads,
\q1
\v 41 but he protects the needy from affliction
\q1 and cares for his families like a \add shepherd with his\add* flock.
\q1
\v 42 The godly \add people\add* will see that and celebrate,
\q1 and all wicked \add people\add* \add will be shamed into silence\add*.
\q1
\v 43 Whoever is wise should take note of those things
\q1 and meditate about Yahweh’s acts of loyal commitment.

\q1
\v 6 \add Use your power\add* to answer me
\q1 so that those you love will be rescued.
\q1
\v 7 God has spoken from his sanctuary, “I will celebrate.
\q1 I will divide up Shekem and apportion out the Sukkot Valley.
\q1
\v 8 Gilead is mine, and Menashsheh is mine.
\q1 Efraim is my helmet \add and\add* Yehudah is my scepter.
\q1
\v 9 Moab is my washbasin.

\q1 I’ll shout in triumph over Philistia.

\v 10 Who will bring me into the fortified city?
\q1 Who will lead me to Edom?”
\q1
\v 11 \add It seems that you’ve\add* rejected us, God?
\q1 You don’t go into battle with our armies.

\s1 My God help me
\d A song by David for the choir director.
\q1
\v 1 \add You’re the \add* God that I praise—
\q1 don’t be silent
\q1
\v 2 because the wicked and deceitful attack me.
\q1 They tell lies about me.
\q1
\v 3 They say hateful things \add all around\add* me,
\q1 and they attack me \add for no reason\add*.
\q1
\v 4 They \add pay back my love with accusations\add*,
\q1 but I pray for them.
\q1
\v 5 They repay me evil for good,
\q1 and they hate my love.
\q1
\v 6 Appoint a wicked man to be over him,
\q1 then appoint an accuser to stand on his right.
\q1
\v 7 When he’s judged, may he be found guilty,
\q1 and may his prayer \add for mercy\add* be considered sinful.
\q1
\v 8 May his days be few—
\q1 may \add someone else\add* take his office.
\q1
\v 9 May his children become fatherless,
\q1 and may his wife become a widow.
\q1
\v 10 May his children wander around and beg—
\q1 asking for handouts as they leave their ruined home.
\q1
\v 11 May the creditor take all he owns.
\q1 May strangers plunder what he earns.
\q1
\v 12 May no one extend any kindness to him.
\q1 May no one have pity on his fatherless children.
\q1
\v 13 May his children be \add eliminated\add*—
\q1 may their \add names\add* be blotted out in the next generation.
\q1
\v 14 May his ancestors’ sins be mentioned to Yahweh,
\q1 and may the sin of his mother not be forgotten.
\q1
\v 15 May their guilt always be \add on Yahweh’s mind\add*.
\q1 May Yahweh \add cause their history to be totally forgotten\add*.
\q1
\v 16 May Yahweh do this because this man never bothered to show any loyal commitment,
\q1 ^but instead harassed the oppressed, the needy, and the disheartened to death.
\q1
\v 17 He loved cursing—may it come back upon him.
\q1 He had no desire to bless \add others\add*—may no blessing come to him.
\q1
\v 18 He wrapped himself with cursing like a cloak,
\q1 and his curse entered his inner being like water—
\q1 like oil into his bones.
\q1
\v 19 May his curses \add cling\add* to him like the clothes he wears to cover himself—
\q1 like the belt he always wears.

\q1
\v 21 Yahweh my Lord, deal kindly with me for your \add reputation’s\add* sake.
\q1 Because your loyal commitment is good, save me,
\q1
\v 22 because I’m oppressed and needy,

\q1
\v 23 I’m fading away like a shadow \add in the late afternoon\add*.
\q1 I’m shaken off like a locust.
\q1
\v 24 My knees are weak from fasting.
\q1 My \add body is frail from not eating enough\add*.

\v 25 I’m scorned by my accusers.

\q1
\v 28 Though they curse me, please bless me.
\q1 When they attack, may they be put to shame,

\q1
\v 29 May my opponents be clothed with shame.
