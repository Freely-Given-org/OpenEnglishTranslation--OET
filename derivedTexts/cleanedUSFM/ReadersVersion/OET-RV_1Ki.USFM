\mt2 The first summary of the
\mt1 Kings of Israel and Yehudah
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk The first summary of the kings of Israel and Yehudah\bk* is a continuation of the account about the kingdom of Israeli started in the account by \bk Shemuel\bk*. It’s divided into three main parts: 1.) Shelomoh (Solomon) takes over as king of the nation of Israel after the death of his father David. 2.) Shelomoh’s kingdom and his prosperity, especially his construction of the temple in Yerushalem. 3.) The kingdom of Israel becoming split into two: the northern kingdom (which goes on to continue to be called Israel), and the southern kingdom (named Yehudah after the largest of its two tribes), and the accounts about the kings who led them through until around 950 B.C.
\ip Here in the first of the two \bk Summaries of the kings of Israel and Yehudah\bk*, each leader is evaluated according to their obedience of God’s instructions, and the prosperity of their entire nations depends of that. Worshipping of false gods and the disobedience of God’s instructions would lead to destruction. The northern kings failed this testing and didn’t prosper, whereas the southern kingdom did have some good leaders and so had times of prosperity.
\ip Also revealed in \bk The first summary of the kings of Israel and Yehudah\bk*, are God’s prophets who brought messages from Yahweh—often warning them against the worshipping of false gods and against disobeying God. The most famous of those in this document is Eliyyah (Elijah) and the account about his opposition to Baal’s prophets (chapter 18).

\s1 David in his old age
\p
\v 1 \add Now\add* King David had become very old, and \add he couldn’t keep warm even when covered with blankets\add*,
\v 2 \add so\add* his servants \add suggested\add*, “\add Allow us search for a young woman who can wait on you and take care of your needs. She can sleep beside you and keep our\add* master, the king, warm.”
\v 3 \add So\add* they searched \add throughout\add* Israel and found a beautiful young woman called Avishag (a Shunammite) and brought her to the king.
\v 4 \add She\add* was incredibly beautiful and she \add took care of\add* the king, but \add he\add* didn’t \add have sexual relations\add* with her.
\s1 Adoniyyah tries to become king
\p
\v 5 Then \add David and\add* Haggit’s son Adoniyyah \add promoted himself\add* saying, “I, myself, will reign.” He \add acquired\add* a chariot and horsemen and fifty men who ran \add along in front\add*.\x + \xo 1:5: \xt 2Sam 3:4.\x*
\v 6 \add Haggit\add* had given birth to him after Avshalom. He was \add a good-looker\add*, \add but\add* his father \add had never disciplined\add* him \add or ever\add* asked, “Why did you do that?”
\v 7 \add He had spoken\add* with Tseruyah’s son Yoav and the priest Evyatar and they had \add both\add* \add agreed to support\add* \add him\add*.
\v 8 \add But\add* the priest Tsadok and Yehoyada’s son Benayah, the prophet Natan, Shimei and Rei, and \add David’s top warriors\add* were \add all\add* \add against\add* Adoniyyah.
\p
\v 9 Then Adoniyyah sacrificed sheep and cattle and fattened calves near the Zohelet stone (which is beside Eyn-Rogel), and he \add invited\add* all his brothers (the king’s sons), and all the men of Yehudah \add including\add* the king’s servants.
\v 10 \add However\add*, he didn’t invite the prophet Natan, Benayah, the \add top warriors\add*, or his brother Shelomoh.
\s1 Shelomoh is made king
\p
\v 11 Then Natan \add asked\add* Shelomoh’s mother Batsheva, “Haven’t you heard that Haggit’s son Adoniyyah \add has made himself king\add*, and our master David doesn’t \add even\add* \add realise\add*?\x + \xo 1:11: \xt 2Sam 12:24.\x*
\v 12 \add So\add* please let me advise you now \add so that you can save your own life and that of your son Shelomoh\add* \add (Solomon)\add*.
\v 13 Go and \add ask\add* King David, ‘My master the king, didn’t you promise your female servant, saying, “Surely your son Shelomoh will reign after me, and he will sit on my throne?” \add So why has Adoniyyah become king\add*?’
\v 14 Then while you’re still there talking to the king, I’ll come in behind you and \add confirm what you said\add*.”
\p
\v 15 \add So\add* Batsheva \add went to the king’s bedroom where\add* Avishag (the Shunammite) was attending \add him\add* \add in his old age\add*.
\v 16 Batsheva bowed \add low to show respect\add* to the king, and he \add asked her what she wanted\add*.
\p
\v 17 “My master,” she \add replied\add*, “you yourself \add promised\add* to your female servant \add in front of\add* your God Yahweh that your son Shelomoh \add would be the one to reign after you and sit on your\add* throne.
\v 18 \add But\add* now, listen, Adoniyyah \add has become king\add* \add instead\add*, and you \add haven’t even been told about it\add*.
\v 19 He’s sacrificing \add many\add* oxen and calves and sheep, and he invited the priest Evyatar, and Yoav the commander of the army, and all your sons \add except for\add* your servant Shelomoh.
\v 20 \add So\add* \add now\add* \add everyone’s waiting to see what you’ll do\add*, my master the king. \add They want you to make it clearly known who’ll be the king on the throne after you\add*.
\v 21 \add Otherwise\add*, as soon as my master the king \add passes on\add* \add to join his ancestors\add*, my son Shelomoh and I will be \add considered to be ‘in the way’\add*.”
\p
\v 22 \add Just\add* then, while she was still talking with the king, the prophet Natan \add appeared\add*
\v 23 and \add his arrival\add* was announced to the king. He went \add into the room and knelt in front of the king and bowed his face\add* to the floor.
\v 24 Then \add he\add* \add asked\add*, “My master the king, \add did you announce that Adoniyyah will reign after you and sit on your\add* throne?
\v 25 \add I ask\add* because today he sacrificed plenty of oxen and calves and sheep. He’d \add invited\add* all your sons and army commanders, and Evyatar the priest. They’re \add all\add* eating and drinking with him and saying, ‘\add Long live\add* King Adoniyyah!’
\v 26 But as for me, I’m \em your\em* servant, and \add nor did he invite\add* Tsadok the priest or Yehoyada’s son Benayah, or Shelomoh your servant.
\v 27 Did my master the king \add organise that without telling\add* your servants who will sit on the throne of my master the king after him?”
\p
\v 28 Then King David said, “Call Batsheva \add back in\add*.” \add So\add* she came \add back\add* into the king’s \add room\add* and stood in front of \add him\add*.
\v 29 Then the king \add promised\add*, “As Yahweh lives \add and has rescued me from every danger\add*,
\v 30 I promise you \add in front of\add* Israel’s God Yahweh that your son Shelomoh will reign after me and will sit on my throne in my place. \add I’ll put it in action today\add*.”
\p
\v 31 Batsheva \add knelt down and bowed her face to the floor\add* and said, “May my master, the king David live \add forever\add*.”
\p
\v 32 Then King David \add called out\add*, “\add Summon\add* Tsadok the priest for me, and Natan the prophet, and Yehoyada’s son Benayah.” \add So\add* they came \add into the king’s room\add*.
\v 33 “Take some of \add my\add* servants,” the king \add instructed\add* them. “and put my son Shelomoh on my mule and lead him to the Gihon \add Spring\add*.
\v 34 Then \add you two,\add* Tsadok and Natan, must anoint him there as king over Israel. Then blow the horn and \add shout\add*, ‘Let King Shelomoh live!’
\v 35 Then \add follow him back here where he must\add* come and sit on my throne. Then he’ll reign in my place as ruler of Israel and Yehudah.”
\p
\v 36 “\add Certainly\add*,” Benayah replied. “Just as Yahweh, the God of my master the king has instructed.
\v 37 Just as Yahweh has been with my master the king, so may he be with Shelomoh. And may \add his rule be\add* \add even\add* greater than \add that\add* of my master, the king David.”
\p
\v 38 \add So\add* Tsadok the priest and Natan the prophet and Yehoyada’s son Benayah and the \add kings bodyguards\add* went and put Shelomoh on the king’s mule, and took him to Gihon.
\v 39 Tsadok the priest took the horn of oil from the sacred tent and anointed Shelomoh \add with it\add*, and they blew the horn and all the people \add shouted\add*, “Let King Shelomoh live!”
\v 40 Then all the people \add followed\add* him \add back\add* uphill \add to the city\add*, and the people were playing flutes and were \add so exuberant in their celebrations that the ground shook with the noise\add*.
\p
\v 41 \add When\add* Adoniyyah and all \add his invited guests\add* had finished eating, they heard the noise, and Yoav heard the sound of the horn and \add asked\add*, “\add What’s all that commotion in\add* the city?”
\v 42 He was still speaking when Yonatan the son of Evyatar the priest \add suddenly turned up\add*, and Adoniyyah \add called\add* \add him\add*, “Come \add over here\add* because you’re a \add good fellow\add* and you’ll bring good news.”
\p
\v 43 “\add Actually, no,\add*” Yonatan answered. “Our master the king David has \add just\add* made Shelomoh \add king\add*.
\v 44 The king sent Tsadok the priest and Natan the prophet and Yehoyada’s son Benayah and the \add king’s bodyguards\add*, and they placed \add Shelomoh\add* on the king’s mule.
\v 45 Then Tsadok and Natan anointed him as king at Gihon. \add Now\add* they’ve \add gone back\add* from there \add cheering\add* \add all the way\add*, and the \add whole\add* city is \add happily\add* \add celebrating\add*. That’s the noise that you’re all hearing.
\v 46 \add What’s more\add*, Shelomoh’s sitting on the royal throne \add right now\add*.
\v 47 \add As well as that\add*, the king’s servants \add went in\add* to bless our master the king David, saying, ‘May God make Shelomoh’s \add reputation\add* \add even\add* better than yours, and may he make his \add reign\add* \add even\add* greater than yours.’ Then the king in his bed, bowed down
\v 48 and said, ‘Blessed be Israel’s God Yahweh who has \add provided\add* \add a son\add* to sit on my throne today, and \add I’ve been able to see it\add* \add before my death\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 49 Then all Adoniyyah’s invited guests started trembling, and they all got up and \add quietly slipped back to their homes\add*.
\v 50 Adoniyyah \add himself\add* was now afraid of what Shelomoh would do, \add so\add* he went \add to the sacred tent\add* and held on to the horns of the altar.
\v 51 Shelomoh was told, “Listen, Adoniyyah \add is afraid of the new king because\add* he’s grabbed the horns of the altar and said, ‘Let Shelomoh the king promise me as soon as \add possible\add*, that he won’t \add execute\add* his servant with the sword.’ ”
\p
\v 52 “If he \add shows himself as a loyal subject\add*,” Shelomoh \add responded\add*, “\add then he’ll be able to keep his head\add*. \add But\add* if \add he’s found to be a traitor\add*, then he’ll die.”
\v 53 \add So\add* King Shelomoh sent \add for Adoniyyah\add*, and they brought him down from beside the altar. He came and bowed down to Shelomoh the king and Shelomoh told him, “Go \add home\add*.”
\c 2
\s1 David’s final words to Shelomoh
\p
\v 1 \add When David knew that his death was close, he instructed\add* his son Shelomoh,
\v 2 “I’ll soon be \add coming to my end, but\add* \add you must be\add* strong and \add sensible\add*.
\v 3 You \add must maintain\add* your God Yahweh’s charge to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, his commands, his judgments, and his testimonies, according to what is written in Mosheh’s instructions, so that you’ll \add be wise\add* in everything you do and everywhere that you turn,
\v 4 so that Yahweh’s promise to me that he’d keep one of my descendants on Israel’s throne, will stand because he gave the condition, ‘If your descendants will \add obey me and worship me\add* in truth with all their \add hearts\add* and with all their \add souls\add*.’
\p
\v 5 “Also you’re \add aware of\add* what Tseruyah’s son Yoav did to me—what he did to two of the commanders of Israel’s armies—to Ner’s son Abner and to Yeter’s son Amasa. He murdered them, \add shedding blood in peace\add -time\add* as if it was in a war\add*, and \add the blood guilt is on him from head to toe\add*.\x + \xo 2:5: a \xt 2Sam 3:27; \xo b \xt 2Sam 20:10.\x*
\v 6 \add So use your own wisdom, but don’t let \add Yoav\add* get old and die peacefully\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add However,\add* return loyal kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and \add invite them to join you\add* at your table because they \add helped\add* me when I was fleeing from your brother Abshalom.\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 2Sam 17:27-29.\x*
\p
\v 8 Then there’s Gera’s son Shimei, the Benyamite from Bahurim. He cursed me \add horribly when I was\add* going to Mahanaim. Then he went down to meet me at the Yordan, and I promised him by Yahweh that I wouldn’t \add execute\add* him,\x + \xo 2:8: \xt 2Sam 16:5-13; 19:16-23.\x*
\v 9 \add so\add* don’t leave him unpunished now. You’re a wise man and you’ll know \add how to handle\add* him. \add Although he’s old, make sure he has a bloody death\add*.
\s1 David’s death
\p
\v 10 Then David \add breathed his last\add* and was buried in the City of David.
\v 11 \add He\add* had reigned over Israel for forty years—seven years from Hebron and thirty-three years from Yerushalem.\x + \xo 2:11: \xt 2Sam 5:4-5; 1Ch 3:4.\x*
\v 12 Shelomoh \add replaced\add* his father David on the throne, and his \add authority\add* was established \add with firmness\add*.\x + \xo 2:12: \xt 1Ch 29:23.\x*
\s1 Adoniyyah’s provocation and death
\p
\v 13 Then Haggit’s son Adoniyyah came to Shelomoh’s mother Batsheva and she \add asked\add* \add him\add*, “Is your coming peaceful?”
\p “\add It is\add*,” he \add replied\add*.
\v 14 “\add Can I ask you something?\add*”
\p “\add Go ahead\add*,” she answered.
\p
\v 15 “You yourself know that the kingship was for me \add as the oldest son\add*,” he said, “and all Israel \add wanted\add* me to reign. \add But then Yahweh decided that it was for my brother, and then everything got\add* turned around.
\v 16 \add So\add* now, I \add have only one thing to request from you—please don’t refuse me\add*.”
\p “Go on,” she said.
\p
\v 17 He said, “Please speak to Shelomoh the king because he wouldn’t \add refuse you\add*. \add Ask him\add* to give me Avishag the Shunammite as my wife.”\x + \xo 2:17: \xt 1Ki 1:3-4.\x*
\p
\v 18 “\add Okay\add*,” Batsheva \add agreed\add*, “I’ll \add personally\add* speak to the king for you.”
\p
\v 19 \add So\add* Batsheva went to King Shelomoh to speak to him \add on Adoniyyah’s behalf\add*. The king rose to meet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat on his throne and he had a throne placed on his right for his mother to sit on.
\v 20 Then she said, “I have one small request for you. \add Please\add* \add don’t say you won’t do it\add*”
\p “\add What’s your\add* request, my mother,” the king \add responded\add*, “because I \add couldn’t refuse you\add*.”
\p
\v 21 “Let Avishag the Shunammite,” she said, “be given to your brother Adoniyyah as a wife.”
\p
\v 22 King Shelomoh answered his mother, “You’re requesting Avishag the Shunammite for Adoniyyah! \add You might as well\add* request the \add throne\add* for him, because he’s my brother and he’s older than I am! And then \add he’ll want\add* Evyatar the priest and Tseruyah’s son Yoav!”
\v 23 Then Shelomoh promised by Yahweh, “May God do to me \add whatever he wants\add*, unless Adoniyyah \add pays with his life for saying that\add*.
\v 24 And now as Yahweh \add lives\add*, the one who established me and caused me to sit on the throne of my father David, and who \add promised David’s descendants to continue reigning\add*, Adoniyyah will certainly be put to death today.”
\p
\v 25 \add So\add* King Shelomoh \add instructed\add* Yehoyada’s son Benayah and he \add went and\add* struck \add Adoniyyah\add* down and he died.
\s1 Evyatar’s banishment and Yoav’s death
\p
\v 26 Then concerning Evyatar the priest, the king told \add him\add*, “Go to your fields at Anatot because you’re \add marked for\add* death, but I won’t \add do it today\add* because you carried my master Yahweh’s \add sacred\add* box \add ahead of\add* my father David, and because you \add suffered through\add* all that my father \add suffered\add*.”\x + \xo 2:26: a \xt 2Sam 15:24; \xo b \xt 1Sam 22:20-23.\x*
\v 27 \add That was how\add* Shelomoh \add banished\add* Evyatar from being a priest to Yahweh. \add It was done\add* to fulfill what Yahweh had said at Shiloh said about \add removing\add* \add Eli’s descendants\add*.\x + \xo 2:27: \xt 1Sam 2:27-36.\x*
\p
\v 28 \add When\add* the \add news of that reached\add* Yoav, he fled to Yahweh’s tent and held onto the horns of the altar, because \add he\add* had \add supported\add* Adoniyyah (even though he hadn’t \add supported\add* Avshalom).
\v 29 \add Someone\add* told King Shelomoh that Yoav had fled to Yahweh’s tent and was \add there\add* beside the altar, \add so\add* Shelomoh \add instructed\add* Yehoyada’s son Benayah, “Go \add and strike him down\add*.”
\v 30 \add So\add* Benayah entered Yahweh’s tent and he told \add Yoav\add*, “The king said for you to come out.”
\p “No, I’ll die here,” he \add replied\add*.
\p \add So\add* Benayah \add went back to the king and reported both sides of the conversation\add*
\v 31 and the king told him, “Just do \add what he said\add*. \add Kill\add* him and bury him, and \add in that way\add* you’ll remove \add the blood guilt from me and my descendants\add* for the blood that Yoav shed without cause.
\v 32 Yahweh will return his blood onto his \add own\add* head, because he attacked two men more righteous and better than himself: Ner’s son Abner, the commander of Israel’s army, and Yeter’s son Amasa, the commander of Yehudah’s army. He killed them with the sword and my father David didn’t \add have anything to do with it\add*.
\v 33 Their shed blood will return onto Joav’s head and on the \add heads\add* of his \add descendants forever\add*. But for David and his \add family\add* and his \add descendants\add* and his throne, \add Yahweh will give\add* peace \add forever\add*.”
\p
\v 34 \add So\add* Yehoyada’s son Benayah went and \add struck\add* \add Yoav\add* \add at the altar\add* and \add killed\add* him. Then he was buried on his \add property\add* in the wilderness.
\v 35 The king \add appointed\add* Benayah \add as army commander to replace\add* \add Yoav\add*, and \add appointed\add* Tsadok as priest in place of Evyatar.
\s1 The killing to Shimei
\p
\v 36 Then the king \add summoned\add* Shimei and told him, “Build yourself a house \add here\add* in Yerushalem and live there. \add But\add* don’t go \add anywhere else\add*
\v 37 \add because\add* the day that you \add leave and cross\add* the Kidron valley, you can be certain that you’ll die. Your blood will be on your \add own\add* head.”
\p
\v 38 “My master the king,” Shimei \add responded\add*, “\add your decision is good and your servant will do just what you said\add*.”
\p
\v 39 \add However,\add* three years \add later\add*, two of Shimei’s slaves fled to Maacah’s son, King Akish of Gat, and Shimei was told \add where they’d gone\add*.
\v 40 \add So\add* Shimei saddled his donkey and \add rode it\add* to Akish at Gat to \add try to find\add* his slaves and \add he\add* \add was able to recover them\add*
\v 41 \add But\add* Shelomoh was told that Shimei \add left\add* Yerushalem and gone to Gath and then returned.
\v 42 \add So\add* the king \add summoned\add* Shimei and \add asked\add* him, “Didn’t I \add get you to promise\add* by Yahweh \add that you heard me say that whenever\add* you leave here, you’ll certainly die? And didn’t you tell me that it \add was a good decision\add*?
\v 43 \add So\add* why didn’t you keep the \add promise by\add* Yahweh and \add obey\add* \add what I instructed\add* you?
\v 44 You yourself know \add all the evil things that you did\add* to my father David, \add so now\add* Yahweh will return your evil on your head.
\v 45 \add But\add* \add despite what you yelled out,\add*\x + \xo 2:45 \xt 2Sa 16:5-8.\x* \add Yahweh\add* \add will bless me as king, and David’s throne will be established forever in front\add* of Yahweh.”
\p
\v 46 Then the king commanded Yehoyada’s son Benayah, and he went out and put \add Shimei\add* \add to death\add*.
\p \add In those ways,\add* \add Shelomoh established his control of the kingdom\add*.
\c 3
\s1 Shelomoh requests wisdom
\p
\v 1 Shelomoh made himself the son-in-law of Egypt’s king Far-oh \add by taking Far-oh’s daughter as a wife\add* and bringing her into the city of David (\add where she stayed\add* until \add the completion of the construction of his palace and of Yahweh’s temple\add*, and the wall around Yerushalem).
\v 2 \add However,\add* the people were sacrificing \add on various hills\add* because \add at that time\add*, a \add temple\add* hadn’t \add yet\add* been built for Yahweh.
\v 3 Shelomoh \add demonstrated his\add* \add love for\add* Yahweh by \add obeying the instructions\add* of his father David. \add However,\add* he would \add offer\add* sacrifices and burn incense \add on various hills\add*.
\p
\v 4 \add One time,\add* the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, because it was the \add most popular\add* high place. Shelomoh offered up a thousand burnt up \add sacrifices\add* on that altar,
\v 5 and that night in Gibeon, Yahweh appeared to Shelomoh in a dream and \add asked\add*, “What would you like me to give you?”
\p
\v 6 Shelomoh \add replied\add*, “You yourself \add showed incredible loyalty to\add* your servant David, my father, because he walked in faithfulness and obedience \add in front of you\add*, and \add did what he believed you wanted\add*. And you’ve \add maintained this loyalty towards\add* him and you \add allowed him to have\add* a son sitting on his throne as \add I am today\add*.
\v 7 \add So\add* now, Yahweh my God, you yourself have caused your servant to reign in place of my father David, but I’m \add still young—I don’t really know much about anything\add*.
\v 8 \add Yet\add* your servant is among your chosen people—a numerous people who can’t be counted because \add there’s so many\add* \add of us\add*.
\v 9 \add So please\add* give your servant \add the ability to listen to your people and to judge them well\add*—discerning between good and evil, because who’s able to judge your people—\add that’s a heavy task\add*.”
\p
\v 10 \add Yahweh was very pleased that Shelomoh had requested that\add*
\v 11 and told him, “Because you requested that and didn’t request a long life or riches for yourself, or requested the \add lives\add* of your enemies, but you requested discernment for yourself \add when listening and dispensing\add* justice,
\v 12 then I’ve done \add what you requested\add*. Listen, I’ve given you a wise and discerning \add mind unlike anyone who’s lived before you or who will live in the future\add* after you.
\v 13 \add So\add* I’ve also given you what you didn’t request: both riches and honour—there’ll be \add no other king like you for as long as you live\add*,
\v 14 and if you’ll \add obey\add* my statutes and commands like your father David did, then I’ll \add also\add* lengthen your \add life\add*.”
\p
\v 15 Then Shelomoh \add woke up\add*, and wow, it had been a dream, and he went \add into\add* Yerushalem and stood \add in front of the sacred chest\add*. Then he offered up burnt offerings and made peace offerings, and he \add held\add* a feast for all his servants.
\s1 Shelomoh judges a difficult case
\p
\v 16 \add One day\add* two prostitutes came to the king and stood \add in front of\add* him,
\v 17 and one of them said, “Please, my master, \add us two women live in the same\add* house, and \add while she was there\add* in the house, I gave birth \add to a baby\add*.
\v 18 \add Three days later\add*, this woman also gave birth \add to her baby\add*. \add Only the two of us were there\add* in the house—no \add one else was around\add*.
\v 19 \add But\add* then in the night, \add her\add* son died because she \add rolled over onto\add* him.
\v 20 \add So\add* she \add got up\add* in the middle of the night and took my son from beside me, as your female servant was asleep. She \add left her dead son with me, and took my son to her bed\add*.
\v 21 \add When\add* I woke up in the morning \add ready\add* to breastfeed my son, \add to my horror\add* he was dead. \add However\add* when I examined him closely in the light, more shock, it wasn’t \add actually\add* my son!”
\p
\v 22 “No, my son is the living one,” the other woman said, “and your son is the dead one.”
\p “No, \em your\em* son is the dead one,” the first woman \add countered\add*, “and \em my\em* son is the living one!”
\p Then they \add continued to\add* \add argue in front of\add* the king.
\p
\v 23 The king spoke, “\add So both of you are claiming that your baby is the one that’s alive and that the dead one belongs to the other\add*.”
\v 24 Then \add he\add* \add ordered\add*, “Get me a sword.” \add So\add* they brought a sword to the king.
\v 25 Then the king \add commanded\add*, “\add Cut\add* the living child into two pieces and give \add them half each\add*.”
\p
\v 26 \add But\add* the \add mother of the surviving baby\add* felt compassion for her son and \add yelled\add*, “Please, my master, give the baby to her—you certainly mustn’t \add kill\add* him!”
\p \add Meanwhile the other woman\add* was saying, “\add Well then, neither of us will have him. Cut him in half\add*!”
\p
\v 27 The king \add spoke up\add*, “Don’t harm the baby. Give the living child to the \add first\add* woman—she’s his mother.”
\p
\v 28 All Israel \add eventually\add* heard \add about this case\add* that the king had judged, and they \add felt an awesome respect for\add* \add him\add* because they saw that he had God’s wisdom to do justice within him.

\s1 Shelomoh’s officials
\p
\v 1 \add So\add* Shelomoh was king over all Israel,
\v 2 and these were his officials:
\q1 Tsadok’s son Azaryahu was the priest.
\q1
\v 3 Shisha’s sons Elihoref and Ahiyyah were secretaries.
\q1 Ahilud’s son Yehoshafat was the recorder.
\q1
\v 4 Yehoyada’s son Benayah was the army commander.
\q1 Tsadok and Evyatar were priests.
\q1
\v 5 Natan’s son Azaryahu was supervisor of the governors,
\q1 and his son Zavud was a priest and adviser to the king.
\q1
\v 6 Ahishar was in charge of the palace,
\q1 and Avda’s son Adoniram \add supervised\add* the forced labourers.
\p
\v 7 Shelomoh \add appointed twelve governors\add* over all Israel, and they \add sent in\add* food for the palace—each \add governor\add* was responsible for one month of the year.
\v 8 Their names were:
\q1 Ben-Hur in the hill country of Efraim,
\q1
\v 9 Ben-Deker in Makats, Shaalvim, Beyt-Shemesh, and Eylon-Beyt-Hanan,
\q1
\v 10 Ben-Hesed in Arubot, Sokoh, and all the land of Hefer,
\q1
\v 11 Ben-Avindav (who was married to Shelomoh’s daughter Tafat) in Nafat-Dor,
\q1
\v 12 Ahilud’s son Baana in Taanak and Megiddo and all Beyt-Shan next to Tsaretan below Yezreel, from Beyt-Shan to Abel-Meholah, as far as the other side of Yokmeam,
\q1
\v 13 Ben-Geber in Ramot-Gilead, including the villages of Manashsheh’s son Yair that were in Gilead, as well as the Argov area in the Bashan region, and including sixty large cities with walls and bronze \add gate\add* bars.
\q1
\v 14 Iddo’s son Ahinadav in Mahanayim.
\q1
\v 15 Ahimaats (who had married Shelomoh’s daughter Basemat) in Naftali,
\q1
\v 16 Hushai’s son Baana in Asher and Bealot,
\q1
\v 17 Paruah’s son Yehoshafat in Yissashkar,
\q1
\v 18 Ela’s son Shimei in Benyamin,
\q1
\v 19 Uri’s son Geber in the Gilead region, \add including\add* the lands of the Amorite King Sihon and King Og of the Bashan.
\p \add There was also one district governor over Yehudah\add*.
\s1 Shelomoh’s prosperity
\p
\v 20 \add Now\add* Yehudah and Israel had become as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They \add had plenty\add* to eat and drink and they were contented.
\v 21 Shelomoh \add controlled\add* all the kingdoms from the \add Euphrates\add* River to the land of the Philistines and as far as the Egyptian border, \add so they\add* brought tribute to \add him\add* and \add followed his orders\add* \add during his lifetime\add*.\x + \xo 4:21: \xt Gen 15:18; 2Ch 9:26.\x*
\p
\v 22 The \add daily requirements for the palace included\add* five tonnes of fine flour and eleven tonnes of coarse flour,
\v 23 ten fattened cattle, twenty pasture cattle, one hundred sheep, \add wild game including\add* deer, gazelle, and roebuck, and fattened fowls.
\p
\v 24 He \add controlled all the kingdoms west of the Euphrates\add* from Tifsah \add in the north-east\add* to Gaza \add in the south-west\add*, and there was peace with all \add his neighbours\add*.
\v 25 \add So\add* all Yehudah and Israel lived peacefully, from Dan \add in the north\add* to Beersheva \add in the south\add*—\add everyone focusing on their own property\add*.
\p
\v 26 Shelomoh had forty thousand stalls for his chariot horses, and twelve thousand horsemen.\x + \xo 4:26: \xt 1Ki 10:26; 2Ch 1:14; 9:25.\x*
\v 27 \add The district governors provided supplies for the palace—one governor for each\add* month. They ensured that nothing was lacking for the king and \add his visitors\add*.
\v 28 They also provided the barley and straw for the \add chariot horses and the other horses\add*, \add delivered to the designated locations\add*.
\s1 Shelomoh’s wisdom
\p
\v 29 God gave Shelomoh wisdom and incredible understanding, and the breadth \add of his interests seemed without limit\add*.
\v 30 \add He\add* \add was wiser than anyone in the countries east of Israel or in\add* Egypt.
\v 31 He was wiser than \add anyone else\add*, including Eytan the Ezrahite and Mahol’s son Heman and Kalkol and Darda, and his \add reputation spread to\add* all the surrounding countries.\x + \xo 4:31: \xt Psa 89 header.\x*
\v 32 He \add could tell\add* three thousand proverbs and he \add composed\add* over a thousand songs.\x + \xo 4:32: \xt Prv 1:1; 10:1; 25:1; Song 1:1.\x*
\v 33 He \add could lecture on plant life\add* from the cedars in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows on walls. He \add taught\add* about animals, birds, reptiles, and fish.
\v 34 People \add from all around\add* came to listen to Shelomoh’s wisdom—\add many having been sent by other kings who’d heard about him\add*.
\c 5
\s1 The preparation of Shelomoh of making the temple
\r (2 Chr. 2:1-18)
\p
\v 1 Then King Hiram of Tsor \add (Tyre)\add* sent his servants to Shelomoh when he heard that he’d been anointed as king to replace his father, because Hiram \add had always been a friend of\add* David.
\v 2 Shelomoh \add replied\add* to Hiram,
\v 3 “You yourself knew David my father, \add and you knew\add* that he wasn’t able to build a temple for his God Yahweh his God because of the \add constant state\add* of warfare until Yahweh \add would allow us to defeat all our enemies\add*.
\v 4 \add But\add* now, my God Yahweh has \add enabled us to have peace\add* from all around. \add We have no enemy, and there’s no threat of danger\add*.
\v 5 \add So\add* listen, I’m \add planning\add* to build a residence for my God Yahweh, just as Yahweh spoke to my father David, ‘Your son who I’ll put in your place on your throne, he’ll \add be the one to\add* build the house \add to honour me\add*.’\x + \xo 5:5: \xt 2Sam 7:12-13; 1Ch 17:11-12.\x*
\v 6 \add So\add* now, \add please give the\add* command to fell cedars for me from the Lebanon \add forest\add*. Let my servants \add accompany\add* your servants and I’ll \add pay\add* your servants’ wages \add whatever amount you set\add*, because you yourself know that there are no \add other workers who know\add* how to fell trees like the Tsidonians.”
\p
\v 7 \add When Hiram got Shelomoh’s message, he was very happy\add* and said, “Blessed be Yahweh today, who has given David a wise son \add to rule\add* over that great \add nation\add*.”
\v 8 \add He\add* sent \add this message back\add* to Shelomoh, “I’ve \add received the message\add* that you sent me and I myself will \add supervise everything you want including\add* cedar and cypress \add logs\add*.
\v 9 My servants will \add transport them down from the forest\add* to the ocean, and I’ll \add get them tied into\add* rafts \add and float them to the place you specify and disassemble the rafts\add*. \add Then it’ll be up to you to get them where you need them\add*. \add All I ask for, is food for my family and workers\add*.”
\p
\v 10 \add So\add* Hiram \add supplied\add* all the cedar and cypress \add logs\add* that Shelomoh \add ordered\add*
\v 11 and each year Shelomoh \add supplied\add* Hiram with \add three thousand tonnes\add* of wheat and \add four hundred thousand litres of pure\add* \add olive\add* oil.
\v 12 Yahweh gave Shelomoh wisdom just like \add he’d said he would\add*, and there was peace between Hiram and Shelomoh and the two of them \add made a treaty with each other\add*.
\p
\v 13 King Shelomoh \add forced thirty thousand men from all over Israel to become his workers\add*,
\v 14 and each month he sent \add a group of\add* ten thousand of them to \add work in\add* Lebanon. \add Each group\add* \add would spend\add* a month in Lebanon and then two months \add at home\add* \add again\add*. Adoniram was \add put in charge of all that\add*.\x + \xo 5:14: \xt 1Ki 12:18.\x*
\v 15 Shelomoh \add also\add* \add forced eighty thousand men to cut stones in the hill country and seventy thousand men to haul loads\add*.
\v 16 Then besides Shelomoh’s chief officers who were \add in charge of\add* the work, there were \add another\add* three thousand three hundred supervisors of the workers.
\v 17 The king commanded \add them to quarry large, valuable blocks of dressed stone for the temple foundations\add*.
\v 18 Shelomoh’s and Hiram’s workers and the Gebalites shaped the stones and prepared the timber for building the temple.
\c 6
\s1 Shelomoh begins temple construction
\p
\v 1 \add So it was that\add* four hundred and eighty years after the Israelis left Egypt, in the second month of the fourth year of Shelomoh’s reign over Israel, he began the construction of Yahweh’s residence.
\v 2 \add It would be\add* twenty-seven metres long, nine metres wide, and fourteen metres high.\f + \fr 6:2 \ft About the height of a modern five-storey building (and the same height as Noah’s barge).\f*
\v 3 \add The five-metre wide porch on the front was the same length as the temple width, so nine metres long\add*.
\v 4 The window \add openings\add* narrowed \add towards the outer edge of the wall\add*.
\v 5 \add Against the outside of the back wall and the two sides\add*, he built \add three-storey (but lower than the wall)\add* side rooms.
\v 6 \add The lowest level was just over two metres wide, the middle level was half a metre wider, and the top level the same again\add* \add (because the temple wall got thinner as it went up)\add*. \add The temple walls had ledges built into them for the beams to sit on, so they wouldn’t have to go through\add* the walls.
\p
\v 7 While the temple was being built, all of the \add huge\add* stones were dressed at the quarry \add site\add*, so there was no noise from any hammer or axe or iron tool \add at the construction site\add*.
\p
\v 8 The \add entrance to the bottom level of siderooms was on the south side of the temple, then from there, stairs went up to the middle level, and more stairs to the top level\add*.
\v 9 \add So\add* he built the temple \add walls\add*, then \add it was roofed with cedar beams and planks\add*,
\v 10 and he built the \add siderooms—each level just over two metres high and attached\add* to the temple with cedar \add beams\add*.
\p
\v 11 Then Yahweh \add had this message sent\add* to Shelomoh,
\v 12 “This residence that you’re building, if you \add comply with my regulations and follow my judgements and obey\add* all my commands, then I’ll \add ensure that everything I promised your father David will come to pass\add*.
\v 13 I will live among \add you\add* Israelis and I’ll never abandon my people Israel.”
\s1 The temple furnishings
\r (2 Chr. 3:8-14)
\p
\v 14 \add So\add* Shelomoh finished the construction of the temple,
\v 15 and on the inside he made walls of cedar boards. The floor was made with cypress boards, and the walls were panelled from the floor to the ceiling.
\v 16 Inside the temple, nine metres at the rear \add were closed off\add* to make an inner room called ‘the very holy place’. That too had walls made of cedar boards.\x + \xo 6:16: \xt Exo 26:33-34.\x*
\v 17 That left the main temple room as eighteen metres long,
\v 18 and it had cedar boards on the walls \add decorated with\add* carvings of buds and flowers \add in blossom\add*. \add All the internal walls were covered with cedar so none of the large stones were visible\add*.
\p
\v 19 The inner room at the back was to house the box containing Yahweh’s agreement,
\v 20 and the room (nine metres long and wide and high) was overlaid with pure gold and equipped with an \add incense\add* altar overlaid with cedar.
\v 21 Then Shelomoh overlaid the \add main room\add* with pure gold, and he \add hung\add* gold chains crossing across the entrance to the inner room that was overlaid with gold.
\v 22 He overlaid \add the interior of\add* the entire temple with gold until it was all finished, including overlaying the altar belonging to the inner room with gold.\x + \xo 6:22: \xt Exo 30:1-3.\x*
\p
\v 23 In the inner room, he made two winged creatures that were five metres high and made of olive wood.\x + \xo 6:23-28: \xt Exo 25:18-20.\x*
\v 24 Each wing was over two metres long, \add giving each one a total wingspan\add* of four and a half metres.
\v 25 \add Both creatures were the same size and shape\add*,
\v 26 \add and\add* \add they were both five metres high\add*.
\v 27 The \add two\add* winged creatures \add were placed across the inner room where their wingtips touched each other in the centre and their outer wings touched the walls\add*.
\v 28 \add Both of\add* the \add wooden carvings\add* were overlaid with gold.
\p
\v 29 He \add had\add* all the \add interior\add* walls of the temple engraved with winged creatures and palm trees and flowers \add in bloom\add*,
\v 30 and he overlaid the floor \add of both rooms\add* with gold.
\p
\v 31 He made doors and doorposts for the inner room with olive wood,
\v 32 and \add both\add* doors were \add decorated\add* with carvings of winged creatures and palm trees and flowers \add in bloom\add*, then they were overlaid with gold that was hammered over the carvings.
\v 33 He made the doorposts for the main temple entrance with olive wood,
\v 34 and the two folding doors themselves each had two folding sections made of cypress.
\v 35 \add These doors were also decorated with\add* carvings of winged creatures and palm trees and flowers \add in bloom\add*, and then overlaid with gold smoothed down over the carvings.
\p
\v 36 He built the inner courtyard with three rows of dressed stones and a row of cedar beams.
\p
\v 37 The foundation for Yahweh’s residence was laid in the second month of the fourth year of Shelomoh’s reign,
\v 38 and it was completed in the eighth month of his eleventh year—meeting all his specifications and requirements. So it took \add over\add* seven years to build it.
\c 7
\s1 Shelomoh’s palace
\p
\v 1 Shelomoh \add also\add* spent thirteen years getting his own palace finished.
\v 2 He built the ‘Lebanon Forest Hall’ that was forty-six metres long, twenty-three metres wide, and fourteen metres high, with four rows of cedar pillars and cedar beams sitting across the pillars.
\v 3 It was roofed with cedar boards on forty-five supports set out into three rows of fifteen.
\v 4 There were three rows of window gaps arranged in sets of three.
\v 5 All the entrances and doorposts were made \add with wood\add* \add planed with square sides\add*, and they were arranged in sets of three.
\p
\v 6 He made \add his\add* covered porch with pillars. It was twenty-three metres long and fourteen metres wide.
\p
\v 7 He made a \add hall\add* for \add his\add* throne where he would judge \add cases\add*—\add called\add* ‘The Judgement Hall’. It was covered with cedar from floor to ceiling.
\p
\v 8 His actual residence \add behind\add* the hall was constructed in a similar way. Shelomoh also built a house for his wife who was Far-oh’s daughter.\x + \xo 7:8: \xt 1Ki 3:1.\x*
\p
\v 9 All these buildings were constructed with expensive stones that had been cut to size and trimmed with saws inside and out. They went from the foundation up to the eaves, and from the outside across to the great courtyard.
\v 10 These large, costly stones in the foundations \add were cut\add* \add in two sizes, with the largest almost five metres\add* \add long\add*.
\v 11 On top of those were other costly stones \add of various sizes\add*, and then cedar \add beams\add*.
\v 12 The largest courtyard had three rows of dressed stones and one row of cedar beams, as did the inner temple courtyard and the \add palace hall\add*.
\s1 Huram comes to work
\p
\v 13 King Shelomoh sent for \add a craftsman \add* in Tsor \add (Tyre) called\add* Huram.\f + \fr 7:13 \ft Sometimes (including this passage) his named is spelt ‘Hiram’, but we’ve opted to consistently name him ‘Huram’ (as per 2 Chr. 4:11) to conveniently avoid confusion with King Hiram (also from Tsor/Tyre).\f*
\v 14 His mother was a widow with Naftali ancestry, and his father had been a bronze engraver in Tsor. He was \add very knowledgeable and skilled in everything to do\add* with bronze, and \add so\add* he came to work for King Shelomoh.
\s1 The two bronze pillars
\r (2 Chr. 3:15-17)
\p
\v 15 He cast two \add hollow\add* bronze pillars—each being just over eight metres tall and measuring over five metres around.
\v 16 Then he made two decorative bronze caps for those pillars—each over two metres high.
\v 17 To hang over them, he made ornamental chains and wreaths—seven sets over the cap on each pillar.
\v 18 Then he made two rows of \add decorative bronze\add* pomegranates to go around each of the two caps.
\v 19 The two caps were each shaped like lilies that were nearly two metres high
\v 20 and there were two hundred \add bronze\add* pomegranates in rows around each cap. NEED A DIAGRAM
\p
\v 21 \add Huram\add* \add stood\add* the \add two\add* pillars at the temple entrance porch. (The lefthand pillar got \add nicknamed\add* ‘Yakin’ and the one on the right, ‘Boaz’.)
\v 22 The two bronze caps shaped like lilies \add were placed on\add* top of the pillars and so the pillar construction was completed.
\s1 The bronze water tank
\r (2 Chr. 4:2-5)
\p
\v 23 \add Huram\add* also cast a very large round basin \add nicknamed\add* ‘The sea’ that was five metres across (so a circumference of fourteen metres) and over two metres high.
\v 24 \add Part of the same casting was two rows of decorative buds that went around it under the lip of the basin. There were about eighteen buds for each metre of circumference\add*.
\v 25 \add Twelve bronze cattle had also been cast and the large basin was sitting on their backs. The cattle were facing outwards with three facing towards each of the four compass points\add*.
\v 26 \add The basin was about 8cm thick and it had a lip around the outside like a lily blossom. It could contain around forty-four thousand litres\add* \add of water\add*.
\s1 The bronze basin holders
\p
\v 27 Then \add Huram\add* cast ten bronze carts \add for individual water basins\add*. Each one was nearly two metres long and two metres wide and just over a metre tall,
\v 28 and they had frames on the sides with panels between them.
\v 29 There were bronze lions, oxen, and winged creatures \add in relief\add* on the panels, and above and below those, wreaths were inset into the bronze.
\v 30 Each cart had two bronze axles with four bronze wheels attached to them. At each of the top four corners, there were bronze supports to hold a \add wash\add* basin, and these were also cast with \add decorative\add* wreaths.
\v 31 Inside \add those supports there was a round frame that protruded half a metre upwards and was inset by a quarter of a metre. It also had engravings on it inside square frames\add*.
\v 32 The axles were part of the main casting, and the four 70cm \add bronze\add* wheels were below the panels.
\v 33 The design of the wheels was similar to chariot wheels, \add but\add* with their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs all cast \add from bronze\add*.
\v 34 Each cart had four handles as part of the casting—one projecting from each corner.
\v 35 There was a 25cm \add bronze\add* band around the top of each cart as well as supports and frames—all part of the main casting.
\v 36 He engraved winged creatures, lions, and palm trees on the flat areas of the carts wherever there was space, and \add engraved\add* wreaths around them.
\v 37 So that’s how he made the ten carts—all the same shape and size using the same mold.
\p
\v 38 \add Huram\add* also cast ten bronze \add wash\add* basins for the ten carts—each one was almost two metres across and could hold 900 litres \add of water\add*.\x + \xo 7:38: \xt Exo 30:17-21.\x*
\v 39 He put five \add basins on\add* carts on each side of the temple (north and south \add of the east-facing temple\add*), and he put the huge basin \add on its bronze cattle\add* near the south-east corner.
\v 40 Huram \add also\add* made the basins and the \add ash\add* shovels and the bowls.
\s1 The list of things/objects there to temple
\r (2 Chr. 4:11–5:1)
\p \add So\add* Huram finished everything that King Shelomoh had requested him to make for Yahweh’s residence:
\v 41 two \add massive\add* pillars with \add large\add* decorated caps and then networks of chain over the caps,
\v 42 the four hundred pomegranates with each pillar having two strings of one hundred of them placed over them,
\v 43 the ten carts and the ten basins on them,
\v 44 the \add huge\add* water tank and the twelve cattle supporting it,
\v 45 and the pots and shovels and bowls and all the other containers.
\p All the above was made from polished bronze by Huram for King Shelomoh for Yahweh’s residence.
\v 46 The king \add had them\add* cast in the clay in the Yordan valley between Sukkot and Tsaretan.
\v 47 \add None of the above was weighed, because bronze was so plentiful that it didn’t matter\add*.
\p
\v 48 Shelomoh also had the gold items made for Yahweh’s residence, including the gold \add incense\add* altar and the gold table for the \add sacred\add* bread,\x + \xo 7:48: a \xt Exo 30:1-3; \xo b \xt Exo 25:23-30.\x*
\v 49 the ten pure gold lampstands that were placed five on each side of the entrance to the inner room, along with the gold flowers, lamps, and tongs,\x + \xo 7:49: \xt Exo 25:31-40.\x*
\v 50 the pure gold cups, trimmers, bowls, dishes, and firepans, and \add also\add* the gold door sockets for the inner holiest room and the main room of the temple.
\p
\v 51 \add Finally\add* all the work that King Shelomoh did for Yahweh’s residence was completed, and \add he\add* \add had\add* all the holy things from his father David, including the silver and the gold and the containers, taken into the storerooms of the \add temple\add*.\x + \xo 7:51: \xt 2Sam 8:11; 1Ch 18:11.\x*
\c 8
\s1 The sacred box is taken to the temple
\r (2 Chr. 5:2–6:2)
\p
\v 1 \add So\add* Shelomoh assembled the Israeli leaders, and the tribal and \add clan\add* heads, in Yerushalem \add to celebrate\add* the arrival of the box containing Yahweh’s agreement coming from David’s city, i.e., Tsiyyon/Zion.\x + \xo 8:1: \xt 2Sam 6:12-16; 1Ch 15:25-29.\x*
\v 2 \add This all happened\add* during the Celebration \add in Shelters\add* in the seventh month of Etanin.\x + \xo 8:2: \xt Lev 23:34.\x*
\v 3 The Israeli elders and the priests lifted the \add sacred\add* box
\v 4 and \add carried\add* it \add to the temple\add*. \add Other\add* priests and Levites brought all the \add sacred objects\add* from the \add sacred\add* tent.
\v 5 King Shelomoh and all the \add Israelis\add* who were there, \add walked\add* ahead of the box, sacrificing \add more\add* sheep and cattle than could be counted, because there were so many.
\p
\v 6 Then the priests brought the box containing the agreement into the inner room in the temple (the very holy place), and \add placed it\add* beneath the wings of the \add two wooden\add* winged creatures,
\v 7 The two creatures had their wings stretched out \add and touching in the middle of the room\add* where the sacred box was placed, so their wings covered over the top of the box and its \add carrying\add* poles.
\v 8 The poles were \add very\add* long and the ends of \add them\add* could be seen from the entrance to that inner room, \add but\add* \add otherwise\add* they couldn’t be seen from the outside, and they’re still there to this day.
\v 9 There was nothing in the box except for the two stone slabs that Mosheh \add (Moses)\add* had put inside at \add Mt. Sinai (also called Horev) \add* where Yahweh made the agreement with the Israelis after \add he’d brought them out\add* of Egypt.\x + \xo 8:9: \xt Deu 10:5.\x*
\p
\v 10 When the priests came back out of the holy place, a cloud filled Yahweh’s residence\x + \xo 8:10-11: \xt Exo 40:34-35.\x*
\v 11 and the priests were unable to stand to minister because of the cloud, because Yahweh’s \add presence\add* had filled his temple.
\v 12 Then Shelomoh said, “Yahweh stated that he would dwell in the cloudy darkness.\x + \xo 8:12: \xt Psa 18:11; 97:2.\x*
\v 13 Actually, I’ve built a raised house for you—where you can live forever.”
\s1 Shelomoh’s address to the people
\r (2 Chr. 6:3-11)
\p
\v 14 Then while all the people stood there, the king turned around and \add pronounced a blessing\add* on all Israel,
\v 15 saying, “Blessed is Yahweh, the God of Israel, who spoke \add audibly to\add* my father David, and then put into action the promise he’d given,
\v 16 ‘From the day when I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I didn’t choose a city from \add among\add* all the tribes of Israel to build a house \add in\add* so that my name would be \add established\add* there. \add Instead\add* I chose David to \add lead\add* my people Israel.’ ”\x + \xo 8:16: \xt 2Sam 7:4-11; 1Ch 17:3-10.\x*
\p
\v 17 \add Shelomoh continued,\add* “My father David wanted to build a temple to confirm Yahweh’s \add power and authority here\add*.\x + \xo 8:17-18: \xt 2Sam 7:1-3; 1Ch 17:1-2.\x*
\v 18 \add However, Yahweh told him that it was good that he wanted to build a temple for him\add*,
\v 19 however he wouldn’t be the one to build it, because it would be his \add biological\add* son who would do it.\x + \xo 8:19: \xt 2Sam 7:12-13; 1Ch 17:11-12.\x*
\p
\v 20 \add Now\add* Yahweh has \add put his promise into action\add*, and I’m here now having succeeded my father David—sitting on Israel’s throne just as Yahweh said, and I’ve been the one to build the residence for Israel’s God Yahweh.
\v 21 I’ve included a place for the box containing \add the two stone tablets with\add* the agreement that Yahweh made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt.”
\s1 Shelomoh’s prayer of dedication
\r (2 Chr. 6:12-42)
\p
\v 22 Then Shelomoh stood \add between\add* Yahweh’s altar and all the \add gathered Israelis\add*, and \add held his arms up towards the sky\add*
\v 23 and \add prayed\add*, “Yahweh, the God of Israel, there’s no God like you in the heavens above or \add here\add* on the earth below, keeping the agreement and \add showing\add* loyal affection to your servants, the ones who \add serve you with honest devotion\add*.
\v 24 \add You have done what you told your servant David, my father, that you said you’d do\add*—you said it with your mouth and then put it into action with your hands as \add we can see\add* today.
\v 25 Now, Yahweh, the God of Israel, \add do the other things\add* for your servant David my father, \add when you told him that there’ll always be one of his descendants on Israel’s throne, provided they follow you like he did\add*.\x + \xo 8:25: \xt 1Ki 2:4.\x*
\v 26 \add So\add* now, God of Israel, \add show that you’re faithful to do what you say, by doing what you told\add* your servant David, my father.
\p
\v 27 “\add But\add* would God really reside on the earth? The sky and the heavens \add aren’t big enough for you\add* so how could this building I’ve constructed \add contain you\add*?\x + \xo 8:27: \xt 2Ch 2:6.\x*
\v 28 \add But still,\add* please give attention to your servant’s prayer and my request for favour, Yahweh my God. \add Please\add* listen to my \add humble\add* prayer that your servant is praying \add to you today\add*
\v 29 that your eyes be on this house night and day—the place that you’ve said \add will be associated with your name\add*. \add May you answer\add* the \add prayers\add* that your servant will pray \add towards\add* this place.\x + \xo 8:29: \xt Deu 12:11.\x*
\v 30 Listen to your servant’s plea for favour, and \add the prayers that\add* your people Israel will pray toward this place. \add Keep listening from where you live in\add* the heavens, and hear and forgive.
\p
\v 31 “When someone \add is accused of\add* sinning against his neighbour and says on oath \add that the accusation is false\add*, and makes that oath in front of your altar here in this temple,
\v 32 then you should listen from the heavens and judge your people Israel, so that wicked people will be condemned \add and bear the appropriate punishment\add*, and innocent people should be \add declared not guilty and dealt with appropriately\add*.
\p
\v 33 When your people Israel are defeated by an enemy because they’ve sinned against you, and they turn back to you and confess your name and pray, and plead for favour toward you in this temple,
\v 34 then you should listen from the heavens and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them back to this land that you gave to our ancestors.
\p
\v 35 “\add Or when\add* the rain \add is held back in\add* the sky because \add your people\add* have sinned against you, and then they pray towards this place and \add acknowledge you\add* and turn away from the \add disobedience that caused the problem\add*,
\v 36 then \add listen to them from\add* the heavens and forgive the sin of your servants and your people Israel, because you’ll direct \add them towards the right way to conduct themselves\add*. Then you’ll \add send\add* rain onto your land that you gave to your people as an inheritance.
\p
\v 37 “Suppose that there was a drought in the land, or \add diseases like\add* blight or mildew, or \add swarms of\add* locusts or grasshoppers, or if an enemy \add besieges them in a gated city\add*, or some other trouble or calamity,
\v 38 \add then if anyone from\add* your people Israel who knows \add about their own disobedience\add* would spread out their palms toward this temple,
\v 39 then \add listen to them from your heavenly abode\add* and forgive their sin, and give them \add what they need\add*. You and you alone are the only one who knows \add what’s inside a human heart\add*.
\v 40 \add Then\add* \add the people\add* will \add want to obey\add* you \add as long as they’re alive\add* \add here\add* in the land that you gave to our ancestors.
\p
\v 41 “Also the foreigners who’re not \add descendants of\add* Israel and who came from distant countries because of your \add reputation\add*
\v 42 (when they heard about your \add nature\add* and \add saw your power in action\add*), and they come and pray toward this temple,
\v 43 \add then\add* listen \add to them\add* from your abode in the heavens and \add do what that foreigner begged of you\add*, so that all the countries will know your \add reputation and respect\add* you like your people Israel do. Then they’ll know that your \add authority is connected with\add* this residence that I’ve built.
\p
\v 44 “\add When\add* your people go out to battle against the enemy, and on the road where you sent them they pray to \add you\add* Yahweh, in this city that you’ve chosen, with this house that I’ve built for your \add honour\add*,
\v 45 Then listen from the heavens to their prayer and their request, and \add help their situation\add*.
\p
\v 46 “If they disobey you (because everyone sins) and you’re angry with them and \add cause them to be defeated by their enemies\add*, and then they get taken prisoner and led away to the enemy’s country (even a far away country),
\v 47 and then they \add have a change of mind\add* in the land where they were taken to as captives, and while they’re still living in that land, they turn back and beg for your favour and confess, ‘We’ve disobeyed and done wrong—we’ve behaved wickedly,’
\v 48 and they return to you with all their \add hearts\add* and all their \add souls\add* in the land of their enemies where they were taken captive, and they pray to you toward the direction of their country which you gave to their fathers, the city that you chose, and the residence that I’ve built for your \add honour\add*,
\v 49 then \add listen to\add* their \add prayers\add* and \add requests\add* from your abode in the heavens, and \add help their situation\add*.
\v 50 Forgive your people who’ve \add disobeyed\add* you and \add forgive\add* the \add wicked things\add* that they’ve \add done\add*. \add Help their captors to be compassionate to\add* them,
\v 51 because \add they’re\add* your people and your \add special possession\add* who you brought out from Egypt—from the middle of the iron-smelting furnace.
\p
\v 52 “May \add you notice\add* the plea for favour from your servant and from your people Israel—to listen to them in all their crying out to you.
\v 53 For you yourself separated them for yourself as a \add special possession\add* out of all the people groups in the world, just as you said through your servant Mosheh when you brought our ancestors out from Egypt, my master Yahweh.”
\s1 Shelomoh blesses the people
\p
\v 54 Once Shelomoh was finished praying this prayer and request for favour to Yahweh, he stood up from bowing on his knees with his palms spread out toward the heavens in front of Yahweh’s altar,
\v 55 then stood \add there\add* and blessed all the Israeli \add people\add*, saying,
\v 56 “Blessed be Yahweh, who has given \add peace to\add* his people Israel \add like he said he would\add*. \add He didn’t fail to do even one part out of all the good things that he told his servant Mosheh that he’d do\add*.\x + \xo 8:56: \xt Deu 12:10; Josh 21:44-45.\x*
\v 57 May our God Yahweh be with us, just as he was with our ancestors. May he not leave us \add or\add* abandon us,
\v 58 \add help us to want to follow him and\add* walk on all his paths and \add obey\add* his commands and statutes and judgments \add that he gave\add* our ancestors.
\v 59 May \add this prayer\add* of mine pleading for Yahweh’s favour, be \add remembered by\add* our God Yahweh day and night—to \add protect\add* \add both\add* his servant and his people Israel \add as each day requires\add*,
\v 60 so that all the \add people groups in the worlds\add* would know that Yahweh is the God—there’s no \add other\add* besides \add him\add*.
\v 61 And \add you people\add*, may your \add purpose be to completely follow\add* our God Yahweh, by \add obeying\add* his statutes, and by keeping his commands \add like you’re doing today\add*.”
\s1 The temple dedication
\r (2 Chr. 7:4-10)
\p
\v 62 Then the king and all the \add Israelis offered\add* sacrifices to Yahweh,
\v 63 and King Shelomoh sacrificed peace offerings to Yahweh (twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep) and the king and the \add Israelis\add* dedicated Yahweh’s residence.
\v 64 On that day the king \add reserved\add* the middle of the courtyard that was \add in front of the temple\add*, because \add that was where\add* he made the burnt up offerings and the grain offerings and the fat pieces of the peace offerings. \add This was\add* because the bronze altar was too small to \add handle all those offerings\add*.
\p
\v 65 Then Shelomoh and \add Israelis from all over the country\add* celebrated in front of Yahweh at that time—\add people\add* from Lebo-Hamat \add in the far north\add* \add down to the Egyptian border\add* \add in the far south\add*—one week, then a second week—\add a total of\add* fourteen days.
\v 66 The \add next\add* day, he \add instructed\add* the people \add to go home\add*, and they blessed the king, then \add went home feeling happy and encouraged\add* because of all the \add good things\add* that Yahweh had done for his servant David\add ’s family\add* and for his people Israel.
\c 9
\s1 Yahweh speaks to Shelomoh again
\r (2 Chr. 7:11-22)
\p
\v 1 \add Once\add* Shelomoh had finished the construction of the \add temple and his palace, and various other projects of his\add*,
\v 2 Yahweh appeared a second time to \add him\add*, \add similar to his appearance\add* at Gibeon\x + \xo 9:2: \xt 1Ki 3:5; 2Ch 1:7.\x*
\v 3 and said, “I’ve heard your prayer and your plea for favour \add requested from me\add*. I’ve \add declared that\add* this residence that you built \add is holy\add* by \add associating my name with it forever\add*, and my eyes and my heart will \add constantly\add* be there.\f + \fr 9:3 \ft ‘my eyes and my heart’: many translations have something like ‘my presence’, but we’ve left it literal here for the reader to interpret rather than oversimplifying what we don’t necessarily understand.\f*
\v 4 And as for you, if you’ll \add behave with godliness\add* just like your father David \add lived with total dedication and honesty\add*, by \add following everything\add* that I’ve commanded you including keeping my statutes and my judgments,
\v 5 then I’ll \add continue your dynasty over Israel forever\add*, just like I told your father David when I said, ‘\add your descendants will never be removed\add* from Israel’s throne.’\x + \xo 9:5: \xt 1Ki 2:4.\x*
\v 6 If you or your descendants ever turn back from \add following\add* me and don’t keep my commands and statutes, and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them,
\v 7 then I’ll cut Israel off from \add the land\add* that I’ve given them and from the \add temple that’s dedicated to \add* my name—I’ll send \add them\add* \add far\add* away, and Israel will \add become an example and a laughing stock\add* among all the \add other\add* \add countries\add*.
\v 8 \add As this temple is on a hill and very visible\add*, everyone who passes \add anywhere\add* nearby \add will see it and\add* will be appalled and will hiss and they’ll say, ‘\add What did the people do\add* \add that was so bad that\add* Yahweh did that to this country and to this temple?’\x + \xo 9:8: \xt 2Ki 25:9; 2Ch 36:19.\x*
\v 9 Then they’ll \add answer\add*, ‘\add It’s\add* because they abandoned their God Yahweh who brought their ancestors out of Egypt, \add but\add* they held on to other gods and bowed down to them and served them. Therefore Yahweh brought all this \add calamity\add* onto them.’ ”
\s1 King Hiram gains some poor cities
\r (2 Chr. 8:1-2)
\p
\v 10 \add It took\add* twenty years for Shelomoh to construct \add the temple for Yahweh and the palace for himself\add*.
\v 11 King Hiram from Tsor \add (Tyre)\add*, had supported Shelomoh with cedar and cypress \add logs\add*, and with gold—\add as much as he’d needed. So\add* King Shelomoh gave \add him\add* twenty cities in the Galilee \add region\add*,
\v 12 \add but when\add* Hiram came \add down\add* from Tsor to see the cities that Shelomoh had given him, \add he wasn’t very happy about them\add*
\v 13 and \add asked\add*, “My friend, what \add sort of\add* cities are these that you’ve given me?” and he called the area ‘Kabul’ \add (meaning ‘Worthless’), which it’s still called\add* to this day.
\v 14 Hiram \add had\add* sent four tonnes of gold to Shelomoh.
\s1 Shelomoh’s other achievements
\r (2 Chr. 8:3-18)
\p
\v 15 Now this is the matter of the forced labour that King Shelomoh brought up to build Yahweh’s residence and his \add palace\add*, the \add raised terraces\add* and the Yerushalem \add city\add* wall, and \add the cities of\add* Hatsor, Megiddo and Gezer.
\v 16 (Egypt’s King Far-oh had seized Gezer and set fire to it and killed the Canaanites who had lived in the city. Then he’d given it as a \add wedding present\add* to his daughter \add when Shelomoh had married her\add*.)
\v 17 Shelomoh \add rebuilt\add* Gezer and lower Beyt-Horon,
\v 18 Baalat, Tadmor in the Yehudah wilderness,
\v 19 all of Shelomoh’s storehouse cities, and the cities for his chariots and horses. They \add also\add* built whatever else Shelomoh wanted—in Yerushalem, in Lebanon, and in \add the entire area\add* of his dominion.
\v 20 All the \add remaining\add* Amorite, Hittite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Yebusite people (they weren’t descendants of Israel),
\v 21 had descendants who continued living in Israel. These were people groups that the Israelis hadn’t been able to annihilate so Shelomoh used them for forced labour (\add where they remain\add* to this day).
\v 22 \add But\add* \add he\add* didn’t \add consign any Israelis to slavehood\add*, because they were \add his warriors\add* and servants, and his officers and captains, and the commanders of his chariots and horsemen.
\v 23 \add Some\add* were commanders of the five hundred and fifty \add work supervisors\add*.
\p
\v 24 Once Far-oh’s daughter moved out of the City of David to \add the palace\add* that he’d built for her, then he built the raised terraces.
\p
\v 25 Shelomoh offered burnt offerings and peace offerings three times that year on the altar that he’d built for Yahweh, and he burnt incense to Yahweh with it, and he completed the \add temple\add*.\x + \xo 9:25: \xt Exo 23:17; 34:23; Deu 16:16.\x*
\p
\v 26 King Shelomoh constructed a fleet \add of ships\add* in Ezion-Geber, which is near Eylot on the shore of the Red Sea in the Edom \add region\add*.
\v 27 \add King\add* Hiram sent \add some of\add* his servants \add who were experienced sailors to serve with Shelomoh’s men\add*.
\v 28 They \add sailed\add* to Ofir and brought back fourteen tonnes of gold that they took to Shelomoh.
\c 10
\s1 The queen from Sheva visits Shelomoh
\r (2 Chr. 9:1-12)
\p
\v 1 Now the queen from Sheva had heard a report \add about how Yahweh had blessed\add* Shelomoh, and she came to test him with difficult questions.\x + \xo 10:1-10: \xt Mat 12:42; Luk 11:31.\x*
\v 2 She came to Yerushalem with \add lots of her top people\add*, camels carrying spices and gemstones and a lot of gold. Then she went to Shelomoh and \add started asking him everything that had been on her mind\add*.
\v 3 \add He\add* \add answered all her questions—there wasn’t any topic that he wasn’t able to shed light on\add*.
\v 4 \add When\add* the queen from Sheva saw \add the extent\add* of Shelomoh’s wisdom, the \add palace\add* that he’d built,
\v 5 the food on his table, the seating of his servants, the uniforms and the service of his waiters, and the burnt offerings that he \add sacrificed\add* at Yahweh’s \add temple\add*, \add she was totally lost for words\add*.
\p
\v 6 She told the king, “\add Wow,\add* everything that I heard about you \add back\add* in my own country, and about how wise you are, is true.
\v 7 I hadn’t believed it until I \add got here\add* and saw it \add with my own eyes, but then I find that what I heard is only \em half\em* of how incredible it is\add*. Your wisdom and your goodness is \add way\add* more than what I’d heard \add described\add*.
\v 8 Your men \add are so fortunate\add* and \add especially\add* your servants who’re always standing in front of you and able to hear \add the wise things that you say\add*.
\v 9 May your God Yahweh be blessed, who \add was pleased with\add* you \add and\add* placed you on Israel’s throne. He \add appointed\add* you as king to \add rule them fairly and honestly\add* because Yahweh loves Israel forever.”
\p
\v 10 Then \add the queen\add* gave to king four tonnes of gold and very many spices and precious \add gemstones\add*. \add Never again did King Shelomoh receive more spices than what the queen gave him\add* \add that day\add*.
\p
\v 11 \add King\add* Hiram’s fleet also \add brought\add* gold from Ofir \add as well as\add* a lot of almug wood and precious \add gemstones\add*.
\v 12 The king used the almug timber to make \add railings\add*\f + \fr 10:12 \ft The exact meaning of this Hebrew word is unknown, especially as it’s only used once. (Other possibilities for the use of this obviously high-quality timber includes ‘steps’ or ‘pillars’.)\f* for \add the temple\add* and \add the palace\add*, and lyres and harps for the \add musicians\add*. Such \add a quantity and quality of almug wood has never again\add* been brought in or seen \add in Israel\add* to this day.
\p
\v 13 Then King Solomon gave the queen from Sheva \add everything she wanted\add*—whatever she requested \add on top of\add* what he \add had already given\add* to her. Then she departed with her servants and returned to her country.
\s1 Shelomoh’s wealth
\r (2 Chr. 9:13-29)
\p
\v 14 The \add amount\add* of gold that came to Shelomoh in one year was \add around\add* twenty-two tonnes,
\v 15 \add not counting what came from explorers and traders\add*, and all the Arab kings, and the governors of the land.
\p
\v 16 King Shelomoh had two hundred body shields made from beaten gold \add overlaid over wood\add*—each shield took six kilograms of gold.
\v 17 \add He also had\add* three hundred \add smaller\add* shields made—each of them \add covered\add* with two kilograms of gold—and placed in \add his\add* ‘Lebanon Forest Hall’.
\p
\v 18 The king had a large ivory throne made and overlaid with pure gold.
\v 19 \add It\add* had six steps \add going up to\add* \add it\add* and \add the seat-back was rounded at the top\add*. \add It had armrests on both sides, then a lion on each side next to the armrests\add*,
\v 20 plus twelve lions standing one on each side of the six steps. \add There was nothing like it in any other kingdom.\add*
\p
\v 21 All of Shelomoh’s cups were gold, and the \add various dishes\add* in the ‘Lebanon Forest Hall’ were \add also\add* pure gold. \add Nothing was made out of silver because it was considered to be of little value during Shelomoh’s time\add*
\v 22 because the king had a fleet of ships that joined \add King\add* Hiram’s fleet. Every three years the fleet would return bringing gold and silver, ivory, monkeys and baboons.\f + \fr 10:22 \ft baboons: We’re not certain of the meaning of this last word (some suggest ‘peacocks’), nor are we sure of the type of the ships named ‘Tarshish ships’.\f*
\p
\v 23 King Shelomoh became \add richer and wiser\add* than \add any other king in the world\add*,
\v 24 and \add even\add* \add people from distant countries would come to see\add* Shelomoh to listen to the wisdom that God had given \add him\add*.
\v 25 Every \add visitor\add* would bring a gift: gold containers, clothes, weapons, spices, horses and mules. \add This continued year after year\add*.
\p
\v 26 Shelomoh \add acquired\add* 1,400 chariots and twelve thousand horsemen. He \add stationed\add* \add most of them\add* in his chariot cities and \add some\add* with \add him\add* \add there\add* in Yerushalem.\x + \xo 10:26: \xt 1Ki 4:26.\x*
\v 27 \add While he was\add* king, silver in Yerushalem \add was given a value similar to\add* stones, and cedar timber \add was given a value like that of\add* the sycamores that \add grow in plenty\add* in the lowlands.\x + \xo 10:27: \xt Deu 17:17.\x*
\v 28 Shelomoh \add acquired\add* horses from Egypt and from Kue—\add his traders would acquire them\add* from Kue for the king for a price.\x + \xo 10:28: \xt Deu 17:16.\x*
\v 29 An Egyptian chariot went for six hundred silver coins and a horse for one hundred and fifty. Then \add they’d export them again to the Hittite and Aramean\add* kings.
\c 11
\s1 Shelomoh turns from God
\p
\v 1 Now King Shelomoh loved many foreign women—besides Far-oh’s daughter \add there were\add* Moabite women, Ammonite women, Edomite women, Sidonian women, and Hittite women.\x + \xo 11:1: \xt Neh 13:26; Deu 17:17.\x*
\v 2 \add They were\add* from the nations that Yahweh had told Israel about, “You must not \add mix with people from\add* \add those nations\add*, and they must not \add join together with\add* you. They will \add certainly entice you to worship \add* their gods.” \add However,\add* Shelomoh clung to them for love.\x + \xo 11:2: \xt Exo 34:16; Deu 7:3-4.\x*
\v 3 \add He had seven hundred wives who were kings’ daughters, as well as\add* three hundred slave-wives, and his wives \add were instrumental in his turning away\add* \add from Yahweh\add*.
\v 4 By the time of his old age, Shelomoh’s wives had \add persuaded him to worship the gods from their countries\add*—his heart wasn’t \add totally dedicated\add* to Yahweh like his father David had been.
\v 5 \add So\add* Shelomoh \add started to worship\add* the Tsidonians’ God Ashtoret and the Ammonites’ detestable God Milkom,
\v 6 \add so\add* \add he\add* \add did many things that Yahweh had said were\add* evil—he didn’t remain fully \add committed to\add* Yahweh like his father David had been.
\v 7 Then Shelomoh built a place to worship Kemosh, the Moabites detestable God, on a hill facing Yerushalem, and also for Molek, the Ammonites’ detestable God.
\v 8 He did those things for his foreign wives who were burning incense and sacrificing to their gods.
\p
\v 9 \add Although Israel’s God Yahweh had appeared twice to Shelomoh, he now turned his devotion away from Yahweh, who then became angry with him\add*.
\v 10 \add Yahweh\add* had \add warned\add* \add Shelomoh\add* not to follow after other gods, but he didn’t \add obey\add* Yahweh’s \add instructions\add*,
\v 11 and Yahweh told \add him\add*, “\add You have\add* this against you: you haven’t kept my agreement and \add you’ve disobeyed\add* my statutes that I \add gave\add* you. \add So\add* I’ll definitely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to your servant,
\v 12 except that for the sake of your father David I won’t do it in your lifetime, rather, I’ll tear the kingdom away from your son.
\v 13 \add What’s more,\add* I won’t tear the whole kingdom away—I’ll leave one tribe for your son \add to rule\add* for my servant David’s sake, and for the sake of my chosen city Yerushalem.”
\s1 Shelomoh’s enemies
\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh \add caused\add* Hadad the Edomite (and a descendant of the Edomite king) \add to stand\add* against Shelomoh.
\v 15 \add In the past\add* \add when\add* David had been in Edom with \add his\add* army commander Yoav to bury their dead, they had killed every male in Edom.
\v 16 (Yoav and \add the Israeli warriors\add* had had to stay there for six months to kill the Edomite males.)
\v 17 \add However,\add* Hadad had been a small child at that time, and \add he’d\add* fled to Egypt with some of his father’s Edomite servants.
\v 18 They’d \add passed through Midyan and then Paran where they’d gained some more men before entering Egypt where King Far-oh gave him a house and land, and provided him with food\add*.
\v 19 Far-oh \add took a liking to\add* Hadad and gave him his wife Queen Tahpenes’ sister \add to marry\add*.
\v 20 Tahpenes’ sister \add gave birth\add* to his son Genubath, his son, and Tahpenes weaned him in the midst of the house of Pharaoh. And Genubath was in the house of Pharaoh in the midst of the sons of Pharaoh.

\v 21 \add When\add* Hadad in Egypt heard that \add both\add* David and \add his\add* army commander Yoav had died, Hadad said to Pharaoh, “\add Give me permission to leave\add*, and I’ll go \add back\add* to my land.”
\p
\v 22 \add But\add* Far-oh \add asked\add* him, “But \add what’s wrong with staying here? You’ve stunned me by asking\add* to go to your land.”
\p “Nothing’s \add lacking here\add*,” he \add replied\add*, “but \add I have to go\add*—\add please give me permission to leave\add*.”
\p
\v 23 God \add also\add* \add caused Elyada’s son Rezon to stand against\add* \add Shelomoh\add*. He’d run away from his master, King Hadadezer in Tsovah,
\v 24 then he’d gathered men for himself and had become a commander of a raiding band. When David \add attacked\add* them, they went to Dammesek \add (Damascus)\add*. They lived there and \add gained control of\add* \add the city\add*.
\v 25 Then during all of Shelomoh’s reign, he’d been \add outspoken\add* against Israel—\add encouraged by\add* the evil that Hadad did. He reigned over \add Syria\add* (Aram) and he \add loathed\add* Israel.
\s1 God’s promise to Yarave’am/Jeroboam
\p
\v 26 Nebat’s son Yarave’am \add (Jeroboam)\add*, an Efratite from Tseredah \add also\add* \add rebelled against the king\add*. (His widowed mother Tseruah was one of Shelomoh’s servants.)
\v 27 \add This is the background about how it started\add*: Shelomoh had built the raised terrace and had \add repaired a gap in the wall\add* of the city of David his father.
\v 28 Shelomoh \add had noticed Yarave’am as a strong and hard-working\add* young man, \add so\add* he’d appointed him \add as supervisor over all the forced labour from Manashsheh and Efraim’s regions\add*.
\v 29 \add One time when\add* Yarave’am \add was away\add* from Yerushalem, the prophet Ahiyyah the Shilonite met him on the road. He was \add wearing a brand-new\add* a new cloak, and \add there was\add* \add just\add* the two by themselves in the countryside.
\v 30 Ahiyyah then pulled the new cloak off \add his shoulders\add* and tore it into twelve pieces,
\v 31 and told Yarave’am, “Take ten pieces for yourself, because this is what Israel’s God Yahweh says, ‘Listen, I’m about to tear the kingdom away from Shelomoh’s \add control\add*, and I’ll give the\f + \fr 11:31 \ft Most English translations leave out this ‘the’ (which is in the Hebrew). However, we suspect that both Ahiyyah and Yarave’am knew exactly which of the ten tribes it would be.\f* ten tribes to you.
\v 32 The one tribe\f + \fr 11:32 \ft It would have been obvious at the time that this was referring to Yehudah. (The unmentioned twelfth tribe is Benyamin—the youngest brother and the smallest tribe.)\f* will be for him, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Yerushalem city which I’ve chosen from all the tribes of Israel.
\v 33 \add This is\add* because they’ve abandoned me. \add Instead\add* they’ve bowed down to the Tsidonians’ God Ashtoret, to the Moabite god Kemosh, and to the Ammonite God Milkom. They’re \add no longer\add* \add following my instructions or doing what they know I’ve said is right\add*—not \add obeying\add* my statutes or my judgments like the king’s father David did.
\v 34 But I won’t take the \add entire\add* kingdom \add off him\add*, but rather I’ll \add leave\add* him as a leader \add while he’s still alive\add* for the sake of my chosen servant David, who \add obeyed\add* my commands and my statutes.
\v 35 \add However,\add* I’ll take the kingship \add away from\add* his son and I’ll give the ten tribes to you \add to rule\add*.
\v 36 I’ll give \add Shelomoh\add*’s son one tribe to rule so that \add one of David’s descendants will always rule\add* in my chosen city Yerushalem \add because it’s associated with my name\add*.
\v 37 \add But\add* I’ll \add use\add* you, and you’ll be able to reign over \add the area where you want to rule\add*—you’ll become king over Israel.
\v 38 Then if you’ll \add listen to everything\add* that I command you, and walk \add on the right path and do what pleases me and\add* keep my statutes and my commands, just like my servant David did, then I’ll be with you. I’ll \add establish a dynasty\add* for you just \add like I did\add* for David, and I’ll give Israel to you.
\v 39 I’ll make David’s \add descendants suffer because\add* of \add Shelomoh’s behaviour\add*, but not forever.’ ”
\p
\v 40 Shelomoh \add tried to kill\add* Yarave’am, \add but\add* \add he\add* \add left the area\add* and fled to Egypt. \add He remained in Egypt under the protection\add* of King Shishak until Shelomoh’s death.
\s1 Shelomoh’s death
\r (2 Chr. 9:29-31)
\p
\v 41 A record of all the other things that Shelomoh did, and all the wise things that he said, was written in the ‘Record of Shelomoh’s Achievements’.
\v 42 Shelomoh reigned over all Israel from Yerushalem for forty years,
\v 43 then he \add died\add* and was buried in the City of David, and his son Rehavam (Rehoboam) became king.
\c 12
\s1 The north rejects Rehavam (Rehoboam)
\r (2 Chr. 10:1-19)
\p
\v 1 \add Shelomoh’s son\add* Rehavam went to Shekem, because all Israel had \add assembled there to make him king\add*.
\v 2 \add Meanwhile,\add* Nebat’s son Yarave’am \add (Jeroboam)\add* in Egypt (where he’d fled from King Shelomoh) heard the news and returned to Israel.
\v 3 \add The leaders of the northern tribes\add* summoned him, and they all went to \add petition\add* \add King\add* Rehavam,
\v 4 “Your father \add Shelomoh\add* \add required us to contribute too much labour\add*. If you’ll lighten the burden on us, then we’ll serve you.”
\p
\v 5 “\add Come back in\add* three days,” he replied, “and \add I’ll give my response\add*.” So the people left.
\p
\v 6 Then King Rehavam consulted with the elders (who’d \add served\add* his father Shelomoh while he was alive), asking them for advice on how to respond.
\p
\v 7 “If you \add want to serve these people well\add*,” they replied, “answer them \add with kindness now\add* then they’ll \add serve you well in the future\add*.”
\p
\v 8 \add However he decided to ignore that advice from\add* the elders, and he consulted with the young men who were standing \add in front of him\add* and that he’d grown up with,
\v 9 \add so\add* he \add asked\add* them, “What \add would you all recommend that we tell the people who wanted me to lighten the burden that my father placed on them\add*?”
\p
\v 10 “You should tell \add them\add* this,” \add his young companions replied\add*. “\add They’ve asked that you should lighten the load on them from what your father demanded, but on the contrary, you should tell them that your little finger is thicker than your father’s thigh bone was\add*.
\v 11 \add Tell them that\add* your father placed a heavy burden on them, \add but that\add* you’ll add to \add that\add*. \add He\add* punished them with whips, \add but\add* you’ll punish them with scorpions.”
\p
\v 12 \add So when\add* Yarave’am and all the \add leaders\add* came \add back\add* to \add King\add* Rehavam on the third day as \add he’d\add* \add instructed them\add*,
\v 13 he answered \add them\add* harshly—ignoring the advice of the elders \add at the beginning\add*.
\v 14 \add Instead\add* he spoke to them according to the advice of the young men, saying, “My father \add placed a heavy burden on you all, but\add* as for me, I’ll add \add to those demands\add*. My father punished you all with whips, but as for me, I’ll punish you all with scorpions.”
\v 15 \add So\add* the king didn’t listen to the people. This change came from Yahweh so that what he’d had Ahiyyah the Shilonite tell Nebat’s son Yarave’am would \add all indeed\add* \add happen\add*.\x + \xo 12:15: \xt 1Ki 11:29-39.\x*
\p
\v 16 \add When\add* all Israel saw that the king hadn’t listened to them, the people \add responded\add*,
\q1 “What \add share in\add* David \add do we have\add*?
\q1 \add We won’t get any inheritance from\add* Yeshai’s son.
\q1 \add Go back\add* to your tents, Israel.
\q1 \add Look at your dynasty\add* now, David.”\x + \xo 12:16: \xt 2Sam 20:1.\x*
\p \add So\add* the \add northern\add* \add Israeli leaders\add* went \add home\add* \add again\add*.
\v 17 \add However,\add* Rehavam continued to rule over the cities in Yehudah.
\p
\v 18 Then King Rehavam \add took\add* Adoniram who was over the forced labour, \add to go\add* \add north\add* \add but the people killed him by throwing rocks at him\add* and the king \add had to hurriedly jump into\add* \add his\add* chariot to flee to Yerushalem.
\v 19 \add Ever since then\add*, the \add northern tribes of\add* Israel have rebelled against David’s \add dynasty\add*.
\p
\v 20 \add So\add* as soon as all Israel heard that Yarave’am had returned \add from Egypt\add*, they \add summoned him to their assembly and appointed him as king\add* over all \add northern\add* Israel. Only \add the Yehudah region was left under the rule of David’s grandson\add* \add Rehavam\add*.
\s1 Shemayah’s prophecy
\r (2 Chr. 11:1-4)
\p
\v 21 \add So when\add* Shelomoh’s son Rehavam \add (Rehoboam)\add* \add returned to\add* Yerushalem, he assembled all the \add tribes\add* of Yehudah and Benyamin, and 180,000 \add warriors\add* were chosen to fight against the \add northern tribes\add* to return the kingship to \add him\add*.
\v 22 \add But\add* God \add told the prophet\add* Shemayah,
\v 23 “\add Go and\add* tell Shelomoh’s son Rehavam, the king of Yehudah, and \add tell\add* all the \add descendants of\add* Yehudah and Benyamin, and the remainder of the people, saying,
\v 24 ‘Yahweh says this: Don’t go and fight against your \add Israeli relatives\add*. \add Everyone should just return home because everything that happened there was initiated\add* by me.’ ” \add When\add* they heard Yahweh’s message, \add they took note of it and everyone went back home\add*.
\s1 Yarave’am (Jeroboam) makes gold calves
\p
\v 25 Then Yarave’am built Shekem in the hill country of Efraim and he lived \add there\add* \add for a while\add*. Then he \add left\add* there and built Penuel.
\v 26 \add After that,\add* \add he\add* \add worried that the entire country might want to go back under David’s dynasty\add*.
\v 27 \add He worried that\add* if the people went \add down\add* to Yerushalem to offer sacrifices in Yahweh’s temple, they \add might shift their allegiance\add* to King Rehavam in Yehudah and then \add his life might be in danger\add*.
\p
\v 28 \add So after getting advice,\add* the king made two gold calves, and he told \add his people\add*, “Going \add all the way\add* \add down\add* to Yerushalem is too \add far\add* for you. Look, \add these can be\add* your gods, Israel, who brought you out from Egypt.”\x + \xo 12:28: \xt Exo 32:4.\x*
\v 29 He set one up at Beyt-El \add (in the south)\add* and the other one at Dan \add (in the north)\add*.
\v 30 This caused the people to sin, and \add some\add* people went up as far as the one in Dan.
\v 31 He built \add temples on hills\add* and appointed priests from \add various tribes\add*—not just from the \add tribe\add* of Levi.
\s1 The warning of worshipping there at Beyt-El
\p
\v 32 In the eighth month on the 15th, Yarave’am \add put on a celebration\add* like the one in Yehudah. \add He’d made\add* an altar at Beyt-El and he got the priests from the \add hill temples\add* he’d made to come and stand there, then he offered a sacrifice on that altar to the calves that he’d made.\x + \xo 12:32-33: \xt Lev 23:33-34.\x*
\v 33 \add That date of\add* the 15th day of the eighth month \add was one that he’d just decided for himself\add*, and he \add instituted\add* a \add new\add* \add celebration\add* for the \add Israelis\add* and he \add burnt incense\add* on the altar \add as a sacrifice\add*.
\c 13
\p
\v 1 Then a \add prophet from\add* of God came from Yehudah, \add taking\add* Yahweh’s message to Beyt-El. as Yarave’am \add (Jeroboam)\add* was standing by the altar to burn incense.
\v 2 \add The prophet\add* called out against the altar with Yahweh’s message: “Altar! Altar! Yahweh says this: Listen, \add one of\add* \add David’s descendants\add* will have a son \add who’ll be named\add* Yoshiyyah \add (Josiah)\add*, and he’ll sacrifice the priests \add from the hill temples\add* on you—the ones who are burning incense on you. \add Yes,\add* human bones will be burnt on you.”\x + \xo 13:2: \xt 2Ki 23:15-16.\x*
\v 3 Then he \add offered them evidence that what he said came from\add* Yahweh, “Listen, that altar will be \add broken\add* into pieces, and the ashes in it will \add spill all over the ground\add*.”
\p
\v 4 \add The moment\add* the King Yarave’am heard the message that the man of God had called out against the altar at Beyt-El, \add he called for the man to be arrested\add*. \add However,\add* the arm that he used to point to him over the altar \add suddenly became paralysed\add* and he wasn’t able to \add pull it back\add*.
\v 5 Then the altar \add itself\add* \add broke open\add* and ashes poured out \add onto the ground\add*, \add exactly as Yahweh had promised through that\add* man of God.
\v 6 Then the king \add begged the prophet\add*, “Please, \add pray to your God Yahweh\add* for me, so my hand \add will return to normal\add*.”
\p \add So\add* the man of God \add interceded with\add* Yahweh, and the king \add was able to use his hand again\add*.
\v 7 “Come \add home with me\add*,” the king \add told the prophet\add*, “and \add have something to eat\add*. Then \add I’ve got\add* a gift to give you.”
\p
\v 8 \add But\add* the man of God \add replied\add*, “\add Even\add* if you \add offered\add* me half of your house, I wouldn’t go with you, and I \add wouldn’t eat or drink\add* in this place.
\v 9 Yahweh already told me not to eat or drink \add here\add*, and not to return home \add by the same road I came on\add*.”
\v 10 Then he \add left for home\add* \add taking a different route from the one he’d used\add* to come to Beyt-El.
\s1 The old prophet from Beyt-El
\p
\v 11 Now \add at that time there was\add* an old prophet who lived in Beyt-El, and his sons\f + \fr 13:11 \ft This is singular in the Hebrew, but the rest of this segment suggests multiple sons.\f* had been and told him all the news about what that man of God had done that day in Beyt-El and they told him the message that \add had been passed on\add* to the king.
\v 12 “\add Oh,\add* \add what road did he take when he left\add*?” their father \add asked\add*, and \add indeed\add* his sons had \add noticed which road the man of God from Yehudah had taken\add*.
\v 13 \add So\add* he told his sons to saddle his donkey, and he rode \add off\add*
\v 14 after the man of God, and found him sitting under an oak tree. “Are you the man of God,” he \add asked\add* him, “who came from Yehudah?”
\p “I am,” he said.
\p
\v 15 “\add Come home with me and have something to eat\add*.” he \add invited\add* him.
\p
\v 16 “\add Sorry,\add*” he \add replied\add*. “I \add can’t go with you or visit your home\add*, and I \add can’t eat or drink\add* with you in this place,
\v 17 because Yahweh \add instructed\add* me \add not to eat or drink here, or to go home by the same road that I came on\add*.”
\p
\v 18 Then \add the old prophet\add* told him, “I’m also a prophet like you, and Yahweh sent a messenger to tell me \add that I should take you home with me so you can have something to eat and drink\add*.” (\add But that was a lie\add*.)
\p
\v 19 \add So\add* \add the prophet\add* \add accompanied him to his house and had a meal there\add*.
\v 20 Then while they were \add still\add* seated at the table, Yahweh spoke through the \add old prophet\add*,
\v 21 and he called out to the man of God who’d come from Yehudah, “Yahweh says this: Because you have been rebellious against Yahweh and \add because you didn’t obey what Yahweh instructed\add* you
\v 22 and you’ve returned and you’ve \add had food and drink\add* in the place where he told you \add not to eat or drink\add*, your \add body won’t be buried in your home town\add*.”
\p
\v 23 After \add the meal was finished\add*, \add the old prophet\add* saddled the donkey for the prophet that he’d brought back,
\v 24 and he left. \add But\add* on the road, a lion \add came across him\add* and killed him. His corpse \add ended up\add* lying on the road with the donkey standing beside it, and the lion also standing beside \add it\add*.
\v 25 \add Some passers-by\add* saw the corpse on the road and \add the unusual sight of\add* the lion standing beside \add it\add*, and \add when they got to\add* the city where the old prophet lived, they \add told everyone the news\add*.
\p
\v 26 \add When\add* the prophet who had brought him back from the road heard he said, “\add That will be\add* the man of God who was rebellious against Yahweh. Yahweh \add must have given\add* him to the lion, and it tore him into pieces and put him to death according what Yahweh \add had said would happen\add*.”
\v 27 Then he told his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” They \add put the saddle on\add*,
\v 28 and he went and found the body lying on the road, and the donkey and the lion standing by \add it\add*. The lion hadn’t eaten any of the man of God’s body, nor had it attacked the donkey.
\v 29 The prophet lifted the body and \add laid it across\add* the donkey and brought it back to his city to be buried in his own tomb.
\v 30 They wailed over him, saying, “Oh dear, my brother,” and they laid his body in \add the old prophet’s\add* grave.
\v 31 \add When the period of mourning was over,\add* he told his sons, “When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried. \add My bones will end up\add* beside his bones.
\v 32 The message from Yahweh that he shouted out against the altar in Beyt-El will certainly happen, and against all the \add hilltop worship\add* places in Shomron \add (Samaria)\add*.
\s1 Yarave’am’s fatal sin
\p
\v 33 \add Despite\add* \add the man of God’s warning\add*, \add King\add* Yarave’am didn’t \add stop his evil ways\add*—\add in fact\add* he \add chose more people from across the country to become\add* priests. \add Anyone who wanted to be a priest would be appointed\add* and he would become one of the priests of the \add hilltop worship\add* places.
\v 34 \add Those were the sins of Yarave’am that would eventually lead to the rejection and destruction of his entire family\add*.
\c 14
\s1 The death of Yarave’am’s son
\p
\v 1 At that time, \add one of\add* Yarave’am’s sons, Aviyyah, became very sick
\v 2 and Yarave’am told his wife, “\add Go and get changed so that no one will recognise you as\add* \add my\add* wife. Then go to Shiloh where the prophet Ahiyyah is—he’s \add the one who prophesied that I’d become king\add*.
\v 3 Take ten loaves of bread and \add some\add* cakes and a jar of honey to give to him. He’ll tell you what will happen to the boy.”
\p
\v 4 \add So\add* \add his\add* wife \add got ready\add* and went to Ahiyyah’s house at Shiloh. Ahiyyah was \add now very elderly and\add* not able to see,
\v 5 \add but\add* Yahweh had told \add him\add*, “Listen, Yarave’am’s wife will be coming to \add ask for your guidance\add* about her son, because he’s sick. \add I want you to tell her so-and-so. And when she comes, she won’t be dressed like a queen\add*.”
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* as soon as Ahiyyah heard her \add walk through the doorway\add*, he said, “Come in, wife of Yarave’am. Why \add did you get changed like that\add*? Now I’ve been \add instructed to pass bad news onto\add* you—
\v 7 go \add back\add* and \add give Yarave’am this message from\add* Israel’s God Yahweh, ‘I \add chose you out from\add* the people and \add placed\add* you as a leader over my people Israel,
\v 8 and I tore the kingdom away from \add David’s descendants\add* and gave it to you. \add But\add* you haven’t been like my servant David who \add obeyed my instructions and followed me with integrity—only doing what he knew that I approved of\add*.
\v 9 \add However,\add* you’ve done more evil \add things\add* than any of those who \add ruled before you\add*. You’ve \add rejected me\add* and made cast images of other gods, and have provoked me into anger.
\v 10 \add Because of that\add*, I’m about to bring calamity to \add your\add* \add family\add*: I’ll \add cause all your male descendants to die, either before or after they’ve left home\add*. I’ll \add eliminate your family\add* just like \add dried\add* dung burns until it’s \add all gone\add*.\x + \xo 14:10: \xt 1Ki 15:29.\x*
\v 11 The \add family members\add* who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the countryside will be eaten by birds. \add All this\add* \add comes from\add* Yahweh.’
\p
\v 12 \add So go back home\add*, \add but\add* \add as soon as you set foot in\add* the city, your son will die.
\v 13 All Israel will \add mourn\add* for him and they’ll bury him. \add He’ll be the only one of your children to be buried\add*, because \add out of all of Yarave’am’s descendants, he’s the only one that\add* Israel’s God Yahweh found good in.
\v 14 \add In the future,\add* Yahweh will \add appoint\add* for himself, a king over Israel who will \add get rid of Yarave’am’s descendants\add*—\add in fact\add* \add it’s beginning to come about\add* even now.
\v 15 And Yahweh will strike Israel just like the \add reeds\add* \add bend over in the swamps\add*, and he’ll uproot Israel from this good soil that he gave to their ancestors and he’ll scatter them beyond the Euphrates, because they made their Asherah \add statues\add* which provoked Yahweh to anger.
\v 16 He will hand Israel over \add to their enemies\add* because of Yarave’am’s sins and \add how\add* he \add encouraged\add* Israel to sin.”
\p
\v 17 \add So\add* Yarave’am’s wife \add left and went home\add* to Tirtsah. \add As she entered the doorway of their home, their son\add* died.
\v 18 \add Just as Yahweh had told them\add*, all Israel mourned for the boy and he was buried.

\v 19 \add Everything else that Yarave’am did, including the record of wars that his army fought and how he ruled, is written in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Israel.
\v 20 Yarave’am reigned for twenty-two years, then he \add died and was buried with his ancestors\add*, and his son Nadav \add replaced him as king\add*.
\s1 Rehavam (Rehoboam) rules in Yehudah
\r (2 Chr. 11:5–12:15)
\p
\v 21 \add Meanwhile,\add* Shelomoh’s son Rehavam reigned in Yehudah. He was forty-one when he \add started\add* reigning, and he reigned for seventeen years from Yerushalem—the city that Yahweh had chosen \add to associate his name with\add* out of all the tribes of Israel. \add Rehavam’s\add* mother was Naamah the Ammonite.
\p
\v 22 \add The people of\add* Yehudah did what Yahweh \add had decided was\add* evil—\add in fact\add* they made him more jealous \add (by worshipping other gods)\add* than their ancestors \add ever had\add*.
\v 23 They even built \add hilltop temples\add* and sacred pillars and poles on every high hill and under every \add large evergreen\add* tree.\x + \xo 14:23: \xt 2Ki 17:9-10.\x*
\v 24 There were also male prostitutes \add associated with them\add*, and \add the Israelis\add* did the same abhorrent things as the nations that Yahweh had removed ahead of \add their entering the land\add*.\x + \xo 14:24: \xt Deu 23:17.\x*

\v 25 In the fifth year of King Rehavam’s \add reign\add*, Egypt’s King Shishak \add attacked\add* Yerushalem\x + \xo 14:25: \xt 2Ch 12:2-8.\x*
\v 26 and took away the valuables from Yahweh’s temple, and the king’s palace. He took everything \add of value\add*, including all the gold shields that Shelomoh had made.\x + \xo 14:26: \xt 1Ki 10:16-17; 2Ch 9:15-16.\x*
\v 27 \add To replace them,\add* King Rehavam made \add some\add* bronze shields and \add assigned them to the officers who protect the entrance to the palace\add*.
\v 28 \add Whenever\add* the king would enter the \add temple, the guards would quickly take the shields there, and when he left, they’d run them back to the palace\add*.
\p
\v 29 \add Everything else that Rehavam did is written in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Yehudah.
\v 30 Rehavam and Yarave’am \add were in a continual state of war\add* \add during their reigns\add*.
\v 31 Then Rehavam (his mother was Naamah the Ammonite) \add died\add* and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David, and his son Abiyyam \add replaced him as king\add*.

\v 1 In the eighteenth year of (Nabat’s son) King Yarave’am’s \add reign over Israel\add*, Abiyyam \add became king of Yehudah\add*.
\v 2 (His mother’s name was Maakah, \add one of\add* Abishalom’s daughters.) He reigned from Yerushalem for three years
\v 3 \add but\add* he \add disobeyed God in ways similar to\add* his father—\add he wasn’t interested in following his God Yahweh completely like his ancestor David had done\add*.
\v 4 \add However\add* for David’s sake, his God Yahweh gave \add Abiyyam\add* a son \add to rule\add* after him—to \add allow Yerushalem to continue on with a flicker of light\add*\x + \xo 15:4: \xt 1Ki 11:36.\x*
\v 5 because David had done \add what Yahweh had said was correct, and throughout his life he hadn’t deviated from what Yahweh had instructed him\add*, except in the matter concerning Uriyyah the Hittite.\x + \xo 15:5: \xt 2Sam 11:1-27.\x*
\v 6 \add Rehavam’s and Yarave’am’s factions were in a continual state of war\add* \add during Abiyyam’s reign\add*.\x + \xo 15:6: \xt 2Ch 13:3-21.\x*
\v 7 \add Everything else that Abiyyam did is written in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Yehudah, \add as the war between Abiyyam and Yarave’am continued\add*.
\p
\v 8 Then Abiyyam \add died\add* and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David, and his son Asa \add replaced him as king\add*.
\s1 Asa’s reign over Yehudah
\r (2 Chr. 14:1-5; 15:16–16:6, 11-14)
\p
\v 9 In the twentieth year of King Yarave’am’s \add reign over\add* Israel, Asa \add became king of Yehudah\add*
\v 10 and reigned from Yerushalem for forty-one years. (His grandmother was Abishalom’s daughter Maakah.)
\v 11 Asa did \add what was pleasing to\add* Yahweh, like his ancestor David \add had done\add*,
\v 12 and he \add expelled the male prostitutes from the country\add* and removed all the idols \add made by the previous generations\add*.\x + \xo 15:12: \xt 2Ch 15:8-15.\x*
\v 13 He also removed his grandmother Maakah from being queen-mother because she had made a horrid Asherah \add goddess\add*, then \add he\add* cut down her horrid \add idol\add* and burnt it in the Kidron \add valley\add*.
\v 14 He didn’t remove the \add hilltop temples\add*, \add but despite that\add* \add he was fully devoted to\add* Yahweh all \add his life\add*.
\v 15 He brought \add everything that father had dedicated, plus more of his own, into Yahweh’s temple\add*, \add including\add* gold, silver, and containers.
\p
\v 16 Asa and King Baasha of Israel \add were in a continual state of war during their reigns\add*.
\v 17 King Baasha invaded Yehudah and \add fortified\add* Ramah \add so that no one could pass in or out to help\add* King Asa of Yehudah.
\v 18 \add So\add* Asa took all the remaining gold and silver from the \add temple and palace\add* storerooms, and \add sent it with\add* his servants \add to take\add* to Ben-Hadad, son of Tabrimmon, son of King Hezion of Aram who lived in Damascus, \add to tell him\add*,
\v 19 “\add You and me have an agreement between us that was made by our two fathers\add*, so look, I’ve sent a present of gold and silver to you. \add So then,\add* break your agreement with King Baasha of Israel \add so he’ll give up on attacking\add* me.”
\p
\v 20 Ben-Hadad \add did what king Asa requested\add*, and he sent the commanders of \add his best warriors\add* to attack Israeli cities \add including\add* Iyon, Dan, Abel-Beyt-Maakah, and all Kinnerot along with all Naftali \add region\add*.
\v 21 When \add King\add* Baasha heard \add about that\add*, he stopped \add fortifying\add* Ramah and \add withdrew\add* to Tirtsah.
\p
\v 22 Then King Asa \add informed\add* all Yehudah \add that they were needed at\add* Ramah. They removed the stones and timber from Baasha’s \add fortifications\add*, and king Asa used \add the materials\add* to build Geba (in Benyamin) and Mitspah.
\v 23 \add Everything else that Asa did, and all his great works and all the cities he built, \add are described\add* in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Yehudah. \add However\add* in his old age, he \add developed problems\add* with his feet.
\v 24 Then he \add died\add* and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David (also his ancestor) and his son Yehoshafat \add replaced him as king\add*.
\s1 Nadav’s reign over Israel
\p
\v 25 In the second year of Asa’s \add reign over Yehudah\add*, Yarave’am’s son Nadav became king of Israel where he reigned for two years.
\v 26 He did \add what Yahweh had said was\add* evil, \add following his father’s behaviour\add* and his sin that \add in turn\add*, caused Israel to sin.
\p
\v 27 \add A man named\add* Baasha (from the Yissashkar tribe) plotted against \add King Nadav\add* and \add killed him at the Philistine city of Gibbeton\add* when Nadav and all Israel were besieging \add the city\add*.
\v 28 It was the third year of \add King\add* Asa’s reign in Yehudah when Baasha killed \add King Nadav\add*, then Baasha \add took over as\add* king \add of Israel\add*.
\v 29 As soon as he \add took over\add*, he \add had Yarave’am’s entire family executed—not leaving a single one of them alive. This fulfilled what Yahweh had said through\add* his servant Ahiyyah the Shilonite,\x + \xo 15:29: \xt 1Ki 14:10.\x*
\v 30 because Yarave’am’s \add own\add* sins, as well as his causing Israel to sin, had provoked Yahweh into getting angry.
\p
\v 31 \add Everything else that Nadav did is written in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Israel.
\v 32 \add King\add* Asa and King Baasha of Israel \add were in a continual state of war during their reigns\add*.
\s1 Baasha’s reign over Israel
\p
\v 33 Ahiyyah’s son Baasha \add began\add* to reign over Israel in the third year of King Asa’s \add reign\add* over Yehudah, and he ruled from Tirtsah for twenty-four years.
\v 34 He did \add what Yahweh had said was\add* evil, \add similar to Nabat’s son Yarave’am’s behaviour\add* and his sin that \add in turn\add*, caused Israel to sin.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add told Hanani’s son Yehu to tell\add* Baasha,
\v 2 “I \add took a nobody and promoted you to\add* leader over my people Israel, \add yet\add* you \add followed Yarave’am’s behaviour\add* and provoked me to anger by causing my people Israel to sin,
\v 3 \add so now I’ll get rid of you and your family—I’ll do the same to you that I did to Yarave’am and his family\add*.
\v 4 \add The bodies of\add* \add those in your family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the countryside will be eaten by vultures\add*.
\p
\v 5 \add Everything else that Baasha did is written in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Israel.
\v 6 \add When Baasha died\add* he was buried in Tirtsah, and his son Elah \add replaced him as king\add*.
\p
\v 7 Yahweh \add sent that message via Hanani the prophet’s son Yehu. It was for Baasha and his family—speaking against the evil that they’d done that had provoked Yahweh to get angry with their behaviour which was as bad as Yarave’am’s family had been. Yahweh was also angry with Baasha because he had killed all of Yarave’am’s family\add*.
\s1 Elah’s reign over Israel
\p
\v 8 Baasha’s son Elah \add began\add* to reign in the twenty-sixth year of King Asa’s \add reign\add* over Yehudah, and he ruled from Tirtsah for two years.
\v 9 \add However,\add* his servant Zimri who was the commander of half of the chariots conspired against him. \add Once when\add* \add Elah\add* was in Tirtsah \add getting\add* himself drunk at the house of Arza (who was \add in charge of the palace\add*),
\v 10 Zimri went in and \add attacked and killed\add* him, and \add took over his place as king\add*. (That was in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa’s \add reign\add* over Yehudah.)
\p
\v 11 \add As soon as Zimri took over and\add* sat on his throne, he \add had all of Baasha’s family executed—he didn’t leave a single male\add* or relative or friend.
\v 12 \add In that way,\add* Zimri \add eliminated all of Baasha’s descendants just as Yahweh had said via\add* the prophet Yehu
\v 13 concerning all of Baasha’s sins and the sins of his son Elah, and because they caused Israel to sin by provoking Israel’s God Yahweh to get angry with their idols.
\v 14 \add Everything else that Elah did is written in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Israel.
\s1 Zimri’s reign over Israel
\p
\v 15 Zimri reigned from Tirtsah for seven days in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa’s \add reign\add* over Yehudah. \add At the time,\add* \add the Israeli army were besieging the Philistine city of\add* Gibbeton,
\v 16 and \add when the army\add* camped \add around the city\add* heard \add that Zimri had rebelled and assassinated\add* the king, that day all the people in the camp \add installed\add* the army commander Omri \add as king\add* to reign over Israel.
\v 17 \add So\add* Omri \add took all his warriors\add* from Gibbeton and besieged Tirtsah.
\v 18 \add As soon as\add* Zimri \add realised that the city was surrounded\add*, he went into the \add saferoom in the palace\add* and \add set fire to the building and died in the flames\add*
\v 19 because \add he’d done what Yahweh had said was evil—following Yarave’am’s behaviour including\add* causing Israel to sin.
\v 20 \add Everything else that Zimri did, including his rebellion, is written in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Israel.
\s1 Omri’s reign over Israel
\p
\v 21 \add At that time,\add* the people of Israel were divided \add concerning their leadership\add*—half of \add them\add* \add supported\add* Ginnat’s son Tivni \add as king\add*, and the other half \add supported\add* Omri,
\v 22 \add but\add* those \add supporting Omri prevailed, so Tivni was executed\add* and Omri \add remained\add* \add in power\add*.
\v 23 Omri \add became king\add* in the thirty-first years of King Asa’s \add reign\add* over Yehudah, and reigned over Israel for twelve years—six of them from Tirtsah.
\v 24 He bought a hill from \add a man named\add* Shemer for seventy kilograms of silver, then built \add his capital\add* city on it. He named it Shomron \add (Samaria)\add* \add in honour of Shemer who’d owned\add* the hill.
\p
\v 25 Omri did \add what Yahweh had said was\add* evil—\add in fact\add* he did more evil things than all those \add kings\add* who \add preceded\add* him.
\v 26 He \add followed (Nabat’s son) Yarave’am’s behaviour including\add* causing Israel to sin by provoking Israel’s God Yahweh to get angry with their idols.
\v 27 \add Everything else that Omri did, including his military victories, is written in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Israel.
\v 28 Then Omri \add died\add* and was buried in Shomron, and his son Ahav \add (Ahab)\add* \add replaced him as king\add*.
\s1 Ahav’s reign over Israel
\p
\v 29 Omri’s son Ahav \add became king of Israel\add* in the thirty-eighth year of King Ahab’s \add reign\add* over Yehudah, and he reigned Israel from Shomron for twenty-two years.
\v 30 Ahav did \add what Yahweh had said was\add* evil—\add in fact\add* he did more evil things than all those \add kings\add* who \add preceded\add* him.
\v 31 \add As if following Yarave’am’s behaviour wasn’t bad enough, he married\add* Izevel \add (Jezebel)\add*, the daughter of the Sidonian King Etbaal, then went and served Baal and bowed down to him.
\v 32 He \add built a temple for Baal in Shomron and placed an altar in it\add*.
\v 33 Ahav \add also\add* made an Asherah pole and went on to provoke Israel’s God Yahweh to get angry, more than any of the \add previous\add* kings of Israel \add had done\add*.
\v 34 \add During his reign\add*, Hiel from Beyt-El \add rebuilt Yeriko city. As they laid the foundations, his eldest son Aviram died, and when they hung the city gates\add*, his youngest son Seguv died, just as Yahweh had told (Nun’s son) Yehoshua \add (Joshua)\add*.\x + \xo 16:34: \xt Josh 6:26.\x*
\c 17
\s1 Eliyyah prophesies about a coming drought
\p
\v 1 \add One day the prophet\add* Eliyyah \add (Elijah)\add* from the Tishbites in the Gilead region said to Ahav, “As Israel’s God Yahweh \add lives, the one who I serve\add*, there won’t be any rain or \add even\add* dew these \add next\add* years unless \add I give the command\add*.”\x + \xo 17:1: \xt Jam 5:17.\x*
\v 2 Then Yahweh \add told\add* \add Eliyyah\add*,
\v 3 “\add Get away from here and travel\add* eastward \add towards the Kerit stream that enters\add* the Yordan \add river\add* \add to hide\add*.
\v 4 \add You’ll be able\add* to drink from the stream, and I’ve commanded the ravens to \add bring food to\add* you there.”
\p
\v 5 \add So he did what Yahweh told him, and went and lived by the Kerit stream near\add* the Yordan.
\v 6 Ravens brought bread and meat to him \add every\add* morning and \add again\add* in the evening, and he was able to drink from the stream.
\v 7 \add However, the stream dried up after a while because there was no rain anywhere in the country\add*.
\s1 Eliyyah and the widow at Tserefat
\p
\v 8 Then Yahweh \add told\add* \add Eliyyah\add*,
\v 9 “\add Leave here\add* \add and\add* go to Tserefat in the Tsidon \add region\add* and stay there. Listen, I’ve commanded a widow lady there \add to keep you fed\add*.”\x + \xo 17:9: \xt Luk 4:25-26.\x*
\v 10 \add So he got ready\add* and went to Tserefat. \add As he entered the town, he saw a woman picking up bits of firewood, and he asked her, “Can you please get me a drink of water\add*.”
\v 11 As she went to get it, he called out, “\add Would you have a piece of bread to go with it?\add*.”
\p
\v 12 \add But she replied\add*, “As your God Yahweh \add lives, I don’t have any bread at all\add*—only a \add handful\add* of flour in the jar, and a little bit of oil in the jug. See, I’m gathering \add a few bits of firewood so I can make a little bread\add* for me and my son. \add After we’ve eaten that\add*, then we’ll die.”
\p
\v 13 \add But\add* Eliyyah told her, “Don’t be \add worried. Go and do what you said\add*, except make some bread for me first and bring it out to me. Then \add after that, you can make some\add* for you and for your son,
\v 14 because Israel’s God Yahweh \add has told me that your flour won’t run out and your oil won’t come to an end\add* until the day when Yahweh gives \add us rain again\add*.”
\p
\v 15 \add So the woman went and did what Eliyyah said\add*, then \add sure enough\add* \add Eliyyah\add* and \add the widow\add* and her household \add had enough food every day\add*.
\v 16 The jar of flour \add never got empty\add* and the jug of oil \add never ran out, just as Yahweh had promised via\add* Eliyyah.
\p
\v 17 \add Some time afterwards,\add* the woman’s son got sick and then \add it got so bad that he died\add*,
\v 18 \add so\add* she hassled Eliyyah, “You man of God, \add why did you come here! Now my sins have been brought to God’s mind, and he’s caused my son to die!\add*”
\p
\v 19 \add But he told her to bring her son to him, and taking the boy from her arms, he took the body upstairs to the room he was staying in\add*, and laid him down on his bed.
\v 20 Then he called out to Yahweh, “Yahweh, my God, \add would you really bring tragedy to this widow that I’m staying with by causing her son to die\add*?”
\v 21 Then three times he stretched himself over the boy’s body and \add begged\add* Yahweh, “Yahweh, my God, please let this child’s life return into his \add organs\add*.”\x + \xo 17:21: \xt 2Ki 4:34-35.\x*
\v 22 Yahweh \add took notice\add* of Eliyyah and the \add boy’s life returned and he revived\add*.
\p
\v 23 Then Eliyyah \add carried the boy back downstairs\add* and gave him to his mother and \add told her\add*, “Look, your son’s \add alive\add*.”
\p
\v 24 “Now I \add certainly\add* know that you’re a man of God,” the woman responded, “And \add when you say that you’re speaking for Yahweh, it’s really true\add*.”
\c 18
\s1 Eliyyah versus Baal’s prophets
\p
\v 1 \add In the third year of drought, Yahweh told Eliyyah to go and show himself to King Ahav and tell him that it would soon\add* rain,
\v 2 \add so he went to present himself\add* to Ahav.
\p \add Meanwhile\add* in Shomron \add (Samaria)\add*, the food shortage was terrible
\v 3 and \add King\add* Ahav had summoned his palace manager Ovadyah. (Ovadyah \add was a sincere follower of\add* Yahweh.
\v 4 \add When\add* \add Queen\add* Izevel \add had tried to kill\add* Yahweh’s prophets, Ovadyah had \add hidden\add* a hundred prophets—fifty \add in each of two caves\add* and \add kept them supplied with food\add* and water.)
\v 5 \add King\add* Ahav told Ovadyah, “\add We’ll\add* go \add across the country\add* to all the springs and all the \add valleys that water sometimes flows in\add*. Perhaps we’ll find \add some\add* grass \add so\add* we can keep a horse or a mule \add or two\add* alive and not \add lose our breeding stock\add*.”
\v 6 \add So\add* they divided the country \add into two\add*, and \add they each went off in a different direction\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add While\add* Ovadyah was on a path, Eliyyah \add came to\add* meet him. \add Ovadyah\add* recognised him and fell \add to his knees with his face to the ground, and asked\add*, “Is it \add really\add* you, my master Eliyyah?”
\p
\v 8 “\add Yes,\add* it’s me,” he \add replied\add*. “\add Now\add* go \add and\add* tell your master \add that I’m here\add*.”
\p
\v 9 “How have I sinned,” Ovadyah \add responded\add*, “that you’re giving your servant \add a death sentence\add*?
\v 10 As your God Yahweh \add lives\add*, my master sent \add people to every kingdom to try to find you, and if they said you weren’t there, then he made them promise under oath that it was true\add*.
\v 11 \add So\add* now you tell me to tell my master that \add you’re\add* here,
\v 12 \add but\add* as soon as I leave you, Yahweh’s spirit will take you to \add goodness knows where\add*. \add Meanwhile\add* I’ll go and tell Ahav, and he’ll come here and not find you, \add so\add* then he’ll kill me, \add even though I’ve been trying to obey Yahweh since I was young\add*.
\v 13 \add Haven’t you heard\add*, my master, what I did when Izevel was killing Yahweh’s prophets and I hid a hundred of them in \add two caves and kept them supplied with food\add* and water?
\v 14 \add Yet\add* now \add you’re trying to get me killed by telling my master that he’ll find you\add* here.”
\p
\v 15 “As \add army commander Yahweh lives—the one I serve\add*,” Eliyyah \add replied\add*, “\add I’ll definitely be here to see him\add* today.”
\p
\v 16 \add So\add* Ovadyah went \add and\add* informed Ahav \add who then came\add* to meet Eliyyah.
\v 17 \add When\add* he saw Eliyyah, Ahav \add asked\add* him, “\add Is that you—the one who causes trouble for\add* Israel?”
\p
\v 18 “\add It’s not me who brings trouble onto\add* Israel,” Eliyyah \add replied\add*. “But rather \add it’s you and your father’s families who decided to ignore Yahweh’s commands and serve the Baals instead\add*.
\v 19 \add So\add* now, \add get all Israel to go to\add* Mt. Karmel, along with the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah who \add Queen\add* Izevel \add feeds at her\add* table.”
\p
\v 20 \add So\add* Ahav \add summoned all the Israelis and the prophets to go to\add* Mt. Karmel,
\v 21 and Eliyyah \add addressed the people\add*, “\add How much longer are you all going to remain unsure who to follow\add*? If Yahweh is God, \add follow\add* him, but if it’s Baal, \add follow\add* him.” \add But\add* the people \add just stayed silent\add*.
\v 22 Then \add he\add* said, “\add I’m Yahweh’s only remaining prophet\add*, but Baal \add has 450 prophets\add*.
\v 23 Let them \add get us\add* two bulls and they can choose one for themselves. Then they can cut it into pieces and lay them a pile of wood that they’ve set for a fire, but they \add can’t light the\add* fire. \add I’ll do the same with the other bull, but also won’t light the\add* fire.
\v 24 Then \add they must call to their god and I’ll call to\add* Yahweh, and the god who answers \add by setting the wood on fire must be the true\add* God.”
\p “\add It sounds good to us\add*,” the people answered.
\p
\v 25 \add So\add* Eliyyah told Baal’s prophets, “\add Okay,\add* \add there’s a lot more of you guys, so you choose your bull and go first and call out to your god, but don’t set fire to the pile\add*.”
\p
\v 26 \add So\add* they took the bull he gave them and \add prepared it all\add*, and then they called out to Baal from morning until midday, \add shouting\add*, “Baal, answer us!” \add But they didn’t hear any voice and got no answer\add*. Then they \add hopped\add* around the altar \add they’d\add* made.
\p
\v 27 \add Finally\add* at noon, Eliyyah \add began\add* mocking them, saying, “\add Call out louder\add* because he’s a god. \add Maybe he’s thinking about something else, or busy with something, or travelling somewhere\add*. Pehaps he’s asleep and \add needs waking\add* up.”
\v 28 \add So they shouted even louder and did their usual cutting of their bodies with knives and swords until a lot of blood flowed\add*.
\v 29 Midday passed and they continued raving \add all afternoon, but\add* they \add didn’t hear any\add* voice, and \add they got no answer or even any suggestion that their god was listening\add*.
\p
\v 30 Then Eliyyah told the people, “\add Okay, now\add* come \add over here by\add* me.” \add So\add* all the people came \add over by\add* him, and he repaired the altar of Yahweh that had been torn down.
\v 31 \add He\add* took twelve stones (the number of the sons of Yakob \add (Jacob)\add* who \add Yahweh told would be called Israel\add*)\x + \xo 18:31: \xt Gen 32:28; 35:10.\x*
\v 32 and \add used them to rebuild\add* Yahweh’s altar. Then \add around\add* the altar he made a trench \add large enough to hold the water to water in two drums\add* of seed.\f + \fr 18:32 \ft A more Jewish interpretation that seems to agree with v34–35—see https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/31555/water-in-elijahs-trench.\f*
\v 33 He arranged the firewood, and cut the bull into pieces and placed them on \add top\add*,
\v 34 and then \add ordered\add*, “Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and the firewood.” Then he said “\add Now\add* do it a second time,” and they did it a second time, and \add again\add* he said, “Do it a third time,” and they did it a third time.
\v 35 The water ran around the altar and even filled the trench.
\p
\v 36 \add When it was time to offer the evening sacrifices\add*, the prophet Eliyyah approached \add the altar\add* and \add prayed\add*, “Yahweh, God of Abraham, Yitshak, and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and I’m your servant, and I’ve done all these things \add following your instructions\add*.
\v 37 Answer me, Yahweh! Answer me, so that this \add country will understand\add* that you, Yahweh, are God, and that you can turn their \add hearts\add* \add back again\add*.”
\p
\v 38 \add Then Yahweh sent fire down from the sky that consumed the pieces of meat\add*, the firewood, the stones, and the dirt \add around the altar\add*, \add including\add* \add all\add* the water that had been in the trench.
\v 39 \add When all the people saw what had happened\add*, they fell onto their \add knees and bowed their faces to the ground, saying\add*, “Yahweh is God! Yahweh is God!”
\p
\v 40 Then Eliyyah \add ordered\add* them, “Grab hold of Baal’s prophets. Don’t let \add any of them\add* sneak away.” \add So\add* they seized them, and Eliyyah brought them down to the Kishon valley and he slaughtered them there.
\s1 The drought ends
\p
\v 41 Then Eliyyah told \add King\add* Ahav, “Get \add ready and have something to\add* eat and drink, because \add I can hear the noise of heavy\add* rain \add coming\add*.”
\v 42 \add So Ahav got ready and had something\add* to eat and drink, \add but\add* Eliyyah went \add further up\add* Mt. Karmel and \add squatted\add* with his face down between his knees\x + \xo 18:42-45: \xt Jam 5:18.\x*
\v 43 and told his servant, “Go up now, \add and\add* look towards the ocean.”
\p He went up and looked and said, “There’s nothing there.”
\p This happened seven times,
\v 44 \add but on\add* the seventh time he came back and said, “\add Wow, there’s\add* a small cloud \add out above the ocean about the size of\add* a man’s palm.”
\p Then Eliyyah ordered him, “\add Rush\add* \add and\add* tell Ahab \add to get his chariot ready and head down so he won’t be caught in the rain\add*.”
\p
\v 45 \add Very soon the sky was full of dark\add* clouds, then wind and heavy rain. Ahav \add kept\add* riding and \add made it\add* to \add the city of\add* Yezreel.
\v 46 \add Yahweh gave Eliyyah extra strength and he tucked his robe into his belt, and ran ahead of Ahav going\add* into Yezreel.
\c 19
\s1 Eliyyah flees to Mt. Sinai
\p
\v 1 Then \add King\add* Ahav told Izevel \add (Jezebel)\add* everything that Eliyyah, \add including how\add* he’d killed all of \add Baal’s\add* prophets,
\v 2 \add so\add* \add she\add* sent \add this message\add* to Eliyyah, “May the gods \add kill me or do worse\add* if I \add haven’t done with your life what you did to\add* \add those prophets\add* by this time tomorrow.”
\v 3 \add Hearing that, he packed up and fled for his life to Beersheva in Yehudah, where he left\add* his servant.
\v 4 Then he went an extra day’s travel further \add south\add* into the wilderness where he sat down under a broom bush and prayed that he \add might be allowed\add* to die, saying, “This is now too much, Yahweh. Take my life, because I’m no better than my ancestors.”.\x + \xo 19:4: \xt Yonah 4:3.\x*
\p
\v 5 Then he laid down and slept under the broom bush, \add until he was suddenly woken by\add* a messenger \add from Yahweh\add* \add telling him to get up and eat\add*.
\v 6 \add Eliyyah\add* looked \add around\add* and wow, there was some bread near his head that had been cooked on glowing coals, and a jug of water. He got up and ate and drank, and they lay down again.
\v 7 Then Yahweh’s messenger returned a second time and prodded him and said, “Get up \add and\add* eat, because \add otherwise\add* the \add journey\add* \add ahead\add* will be too much for you.”
\v 8 \add So\add* he got up and ate and drank. \add That food lasted his for forty days as he travelled to\add* God’s mountain, Horeb \add (Mt. Sinai)\add*.
\v 9 He entered a cave there and overnighted \add in the cave\add*, then \add suddenly Yahweh spoke to him, asking\add*, “What are you doing here, Eliyyah?”
\p
\v 10 “I’ve been very zealous for \add you\add*, army commander Yahweh,” he \add replied\add*. “But the \add Israeli people\add* have abandoned your agreement, and they’ve torn down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword. \add So\add* \add here\add* I am, left by myself \add while meanwhile they’re trying to kill me\add*.”\x + \xo 19:10-14: \xt Rom 11:3.\x*
\p
\v 11 Then \add Yahweh\add* said, “Go out and stand on the mountain \add in front of me,\add* Yahweh. Then look, \add I’m\add* about to \add go past you\add*.” Then \add there was an incredibly\add* strong wind \add that hit the mountain and broke off bits of rock that then shattered\add*. \add But\add* Yahweh wasn’t in the wind, and after the wind there was an earthquake \add but\add* Yahweh wasn’t in the earthquake \add either\add*.
\v 12 After the earthquake there was a fire, \add but\add* Yahweh wasn’t in the fire.
\p Then after the fire, there was the sound of a soft whisper.
\v 13 \add When\add* Eliyyah heard \add that\add*, he wrapped his cloak around his face and went out and stood at the opening of the cave, and he heard a voice \add ask\add* him, “\add Why are\add* you here, Eliyyah?”
\p
\v 14 “I’ve been very zealous for \add you,\add* army commander Yahweh,” he \add replied\add*, “\add But\add* the \add Israeli people\add* have abandoned your agreement, and they’ve torn down your altars and killed your prophets with the sword. \add So\add* \add here\add* I am, left by myself \add while meanwhile they’re trying to kill me\add*.”
\p
\v 15 Then Yahweh told him, “Go \add back\add* towards the Damascus wilderness, then you must go and anoint Hazael as king over Aram \add (Syria)\add*.\x + \xo 19:15: \xt 2Ki 8:7-13.\x*
\v 16 \add Also\add* you \add need to\add* anoint Nimshi’s son Yehu as king over Israel, and you must anoint Shafat’s son Elisha from Abel-Meholah \add to succeed you as prophet\add*.\x + \xo 19:16: \xt 2Ki 9:1-6.\x*
\v 17 \add In the future\add*, \add anyone who escapes from being killed\add* by Hazael’s \add army\add* will be \add killed\add* by Yehu’s \add army\add* will \add be killed\add* by Elisha.
\v 18 \add But\add* I’ve \add still\add* got seven thousand people in Israel \add who’ve never bowed to Baal or kissed his image\add*.”\x + \xo 19:18: \xt Rom 11:4.\x*
\s1 Eliyyah inspires Elisha
\p
\v 19 \add So\add* \add Eliyyah\add* left that place and went and found Shafat’s son Elisha. \add There were twelve teams ploughing a field and he was with the back pair\add* \add of cattle\add*. Eliyyah \add walked\add* past him and threw his cloak over him.
\v 20 \add Elisha\add* left \add the plough\add* and ran after Eliyyah, saying, “Please let me kiss my father and my mother, then \add I’ll come with\add* you.”
\p “Go \add on back then\add*,” \add Eliyyah\add* \add replied\add*, “\add because I haven’t done anything for\add* you.”
\p
\v 21 \add So\add* \add Elisha\add* went back and killed his pair of cattle. He \add used the wood of the plough to cook the meat on, and he shared it around\add* the people. \add After they’d eaten, he packed up and followed Eliyyah and became his helper\add*.
\c 20
\s1 Ben-Hadad attacks Shomron
\p
\v 1 \add At that time,\add* King Ben-Hadam of Aram \add (Syria)\add* \add joined with thirty-two smaller kingdoms and they brought their combined armies and horses and chariots\add* and besieged Israel’s capital Shomron \add (Samaria) ready\add* to attack it.
\v 2 He sent messengers to Israel’s King Ahav \add who was inside\add* the city
\v 3 to tell him, “Ben-Hadad says that your gold and silver are mine, as well as the best of your wives and sons.”
\p
\v 4 “\add Whatever you say\add*, my master the king,” replied Israel’s king. “\add I’m yours along with everything I have\add*.”
\p
\v 5 Then the messengers returned, saying, “Ben Hadad said that you’ll give him your gold and silver and your wives and sons,
\v 6 but around this time tomorrow, he’ll send his servants to you to search through your \add palace\add* and the homes of your \add people\add*, and they’ll take \add everything that they consider to be of value\add*.”
\p
\v 7 \add So\add* Israel’s king \add summoned\add* all Israel’s leaders and told them, “\add Listen and note how this man is looking for trouble. He’s claiming my wives and my sons, and my gold and silver, and I didn’t contradict\add* him.”
\p
\v 8 \add But\add* the elders and all the others \add responded\add*, “\add No,\add* don’t listen \add to him\add* and don’t consent \add to his demands\add*.”
\p
\v 9 \add So\add* \add Ahab\add* told Ben-Hadad’s messengers, “Tell my master the king that \add everything he demanded the first time\add*, I’ll do, \add but I can’t agree to this new demand\add*.”
\p \add So\add* \add they\add* returned \add to Ben-Hadad\add* \add with that response\add*
\v 10 and Ben-Hadad sent another message, “\add The gods can do whatever they like to me and more if I leave enough dust in Shomron for all my prisoners to have a handful each\add*.”\f + \fr 20:10 \ft Most translations interpret ‘all the people at my feet’ to be Ben-Hadad’s (large) army (which appears to go back at least to the Vulgate ‘sequitur’), but we’ve TENTATIVELY interpreted it as his (future) prisoners/slaves.\f*
\p
\v 11 Israel’s king replied, “Tell \add Ben-Hadad\add* \add that someone who’s heading to battle shouldn’t boast like someone relaxing after his victory\add*.”
\p
\v 12 \add Ben-Hadad\add* \add received that message while\add* he was in the huts drinking with the \add other\add* kings, and he \add immediately\add* \add ordered his men to get into position so they got ready to attack\add* the city.
\p
\v 13 \add Just then,\add*, a prophet \add approached\add* Israel’s King Ahav and told \add him\add*, “Yahweh \add asks if you’ve seen that great army, because he’s going to give you victory over them today so you’ll know that Yahweh is God\add*.”
\p
\v 14 “\add Who will enable the victory\add*?” Ahav \add asked\add*.
\p “Yahweh says \add it’ll be\add* the young men under the provincial commanders,” he \add answered\add*.
\p “Who \add should lead the attack\add*?” he \add asked\add*.
\p “You \add should\add*,” \add the prophet\add* \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 15 \add So\add* \add Ahav\add* gathered the provincial commanders’ young men and there were 232 of them. He \add also\add* assembled the \add fighting men\add* and there were \add merely\add* seven thousand of them.
\p
\v 16 They \add exited the city\add* at midday, \add while\add* Ben-Hadad and the \add other\add* kings were \add still\add* getting drunk in their huts.
\v 17 The young men under the provincial commanders \add led the way out\add*, and \add the scouts\add* \add that Ben-Hadad had sent out informed\add* him that men were coming out of Shomron.
\v 18 He \add ordered\add*, “Whether they’ve come out for peace or for battle, capture them alive.”
\p
\v 19 The provincial commanders’ young men exited the city followed by the \add warriors\add*
\v 20 and each of them killed their opponent. Then the Arameans \add took off with the Israelis\add* chasing them, \add but\add* King Ben-Hadad escaped on a horse along with other riders.
\v 21 Then Israel’s king \add led more men out\add* and they attacked the horses and chariots—\add thoroughly defeating\add* Aram.
\p
\v 22 \add Afterwards\add* \add that same\add* prophet went \add back\add* to King Ahav and told him, “Go \add back and\add* \add fortify your defenses and plan your strategy\add*, because Aram’s king \add will attack you again at the same time next\add* year.”
\s1 Ben-Hadad’s second attack
\p
\v 23 \add Meanwhile\add* the servants of Aram’s king told him, “Their gods are the gods of the hills, so that’s why they were stronger than us. \add But\add* let’s fight them on the plain instead \add then we’ll be sure to defeat\add* them.
\v 24 \add So this is what you should\add* do: relieve those kings of \add their command and replace them with military commanders\add*.
\v 25 Then \add gather an army like the one that was defeated, with as many horses and chariots as you had.\add* Then we’ll fight them on the plain and \add we’ll be sure to defeat\add* them.”
\p \add Ben-Hadad\add* \add took their advice and put the plan into action\add*.
\v 26 \add The following\add* year, \add he\add* \add assembled his army\add* and went to Afek to battle \add the Israelis\add*,
\v 27 and the \add Israeli warriors assembled and received their supplies\add*. Then they went to confront them, \add but\add* \add they\add* \add seemed like ants in comparison to the massive Aramean army\add*.
\p
\v 28 A man of God approached Israel’s king and told \add him\add*, “Yahweh says \add that the Arameans\add* have been saying that he’s a god of the hills, but not of the valleys. \add Because of that, he’s going to help you defeat this huge army\add*, and then you’ll know that Yahweh \add is God\add*.”
\p
\v 29 \add The two armies\add* \add remained camped opposite each other for\add* seven days, then the battle \add began and the Israelis killed a hundred thousand Aramean soldiers that\add* day.
\v 30 The \add remainder\add* fled into Afek, \add but\add* the \add city\add* wall fell onto the remaining twenty-seven thousand men.
\p Ben-Hadad ran into the city and \add hid in an inner room\add*,
\v 31 \add but\add* his servants told him, “Listen, we’ve heard that the \add Israeli kings show\add* mercy. Please let us wrap sackcloth around our waists and go out to Israel’s king with ropes on our heads—perhaps he’ll \add spare\add* your life.”
\v 32 \add So\add* they wrapped their waists in sacking and put ropes on their heads, and went to Israel’s king, saying, “Your servant Ben Hadad \add asks you to spare his\add* life.”
\p “Is he still alive?” he \add asked\add*. “He’s \add like a brother to me\add*.”
\p
\v 33 The men \add were looking for an indication\add* \add of mercy\add* and \add when they heard that they were encouraged\add*. “\add Yes,\add*, Ben-Hadad is \add like\add* your brother,” they said.
\p “\add Yes,\add*, bring him \add here\add*,” he \add responded\add*.
\p \add So\add* Ben-Hadad \add revealed himself\add* and was brought into \add Ahav’s\add* chariot,
\v 34 and he told \add Ahav\add*, “I’ll return the cities that my father took from with \add yours\add*, and \add your traders can set up stalls\add* in Damascus, just as my father \add did\add* in Shomron.”
\p “\add Okay, I’ll accept that agreement and release\add* you,” \add Ahav said,\add* and \add after formalising the agreement\add*, he sent him away.
\s1 A prophet condemns Ahab
\p
\v 35 \add One day,\add* a prophet \add in training with a group\add* told his companion, “By Yahweh’s command, please wound me.” \add But\add* the man refused to \add slash\add* him,
\v 36 \add so\add* the \add first\add* prophet told him, “Because you didn’t \add obey Yahweh’s command\add*, listen, \add as soon as you leave here you’ll be attacked by a\add* lion.” Then after he \add left\add*, a lion found him and \add killed\add* him.\x + \xo 20:36: \xt 1Ki 13:24.\x*
\p
\v 37 Then he found \add another prophet\add* and said, “Strike me, please,” and the man struck him \add with a sword\add*—wounding \add him\add*.
\v 38 Then the \add wounded\add* prophet \add disguised himself\add* with a covering over his eyes and went and stood on the road \add to wait\add* for the king.
\v 39 \add When the king came past\add*, \add the prophet\add* called out to \add him\add*, saying, “Your servant went out in the middle of the battle, and suddenly, a man \add came across with a captive\add* and told \add me\add*, ‘Guard this man. If he \add goes\add* missing, your life will be \add forfeit\add* in place of his, or else you’ll \add be fined three thousand pieces\add* of silver.’
\v 40 \add But while I was busy with other things, the man escaped\add*.”
\p “\add Well,\add* \add by your own testimony, you deserve your punishment\add*,” \add King Ahav\add* \add responded\add*.
\p
\v 41 Then he quickly \add uncovered\add* his eyes and the king recognised that he was one of the prophets,
\v 42 and \add the prophet\add* told him, “Yahweh says that because you \add released\add* a man \add who should have been executed\add*, then your life \add will be required\add* in place of his, and your people in place of his people.”
\p
\v 43 Then the king went \add on\add* to his house in Shomron, \add but he was\add* \add angry and depressed inside\add*.
\c 21
\s1 Navot’s vineyard
\p
\v 1 \add Sometime after that\add*, King Ahav from Shomron \add was in his\add* palace in Yizreel city, and \add his neighbour was\add* the Yezreelite Navot \add (Naboth)\add* \add with his\add* vineyard.
\v 2 Ahav \add pressured\add* Navot, “Give me your vineyard \add so I can make it into my vegetable garden\add* because it’s right beside my house. \add I can replace it with\add* a better vineyard, \add or if you prefer, I can pay you in silver for\add* this one.”
\p
\v 3 \add But\add* Navot \add replied\add*, “Far be it for me \add to disobey\add* Yahweh by giving up the inheritance \add entrusted to\add* my ancestors.”
\p
\v 4 \add So\add* Ahav went \add back\add* to his palace bitter and angry \add because of Navot’s refusal to turn over the land\add*. He \add refused to eat\add* and \add went\add* to bed with his face towards the wall,
\v 5 \add but\add* his wife Izevel went in and \add demanded\add*, “What’s this \add about eating nothing and going to bed in a sulk\add*?”
\p
\v 6 “\add Well,\add* I talked with Navot the Yezreelite,” he \add replied\add*. “\add I offered to pay cash for his vineyard or to exchange it for another one if he preferred, but he wouldn’t let me have it\add*.”
\p
\v 7 “\add What!\add* \add You’re the king of\add* Israel!” his wife \add responded\add*. “Get up \add and\add* \add have something to eat and cheer up\add*! I’ll \add make sure myself that you get\add* Navot’s vineyard.”
\p
\v 8 \add So\add* she wrote letters in Ahav’s name and sealed them with his seal. Then she sent them to the city elders and nobles who lived near Navot.
\v 9 \add This is what\add* she wrote, “Announce a fast, and seat Navot hear the head \add of the table\add*.
\v 10 Then seat two \add troublemakers opposite\add* him, and get them to testify against him that he cursed God and the king. Then take him outside and \add pelt him with rocks until he’s dead\add*.
\p
\v 11 Then the elders and nobles of the city did what Izevel had instructed them via the letters:
\v 12 They announced a fast and seated Navot near the head \add of the table\add*,
\v 13 then two worthless men \add were seated opposite him\add*, and they testified in front of \add all\add* the people that Navot had cursed God and the king. \add So\add* Navot was led out of the city and \add killed by having rocks thrown at him\add*,
\v 14 and they sent \add a message\add* to Izevel \add to tell her that Navot had been stoned to death\add*.
\p
\v 15 As soon as Izevel heard that Navot had been \add executed\add*, \add she\add* told Ahav, “\add Go on now\add* \add and\add* \add take over\add* Navot’s vineyard that he refused to \add sell\add* you, because he’s \add not around any more\add*—he’s dead.”
\v 16 As soon as Ahav heard that Navot was dead, \add he\add* went to the vineyard to take possession of it.
\p
\v 17 Then Yahweh told Eliyyah (from Tishbe),
\v 18 “\add Leave here\add* \add and\add* go to Israel’s king Ahav in Shomron. Listen, he’s there in Navot’s vineyard, where he’s gone to \add take possession of\add* it.
\v 19 Tell him that Yahweh’s asking if he’s taking possession \add of the property\add* \add of a murdered man\add*. Then tell him that Yahweh \add wants him to know that\add* the dogs will lick his blood in the same place where Navot died and the dogs came and licked up his blood.”
\p
\v 20 \add When Eliyyah arrived\add*, Ahav \add asked\add* \add him\add*, “\add Ah,\add* my enemy. Have you found me?”
\p “\add Yes,\add* I’ve found \add you\add*,” \add Eliyyah\add* \add replied\add*. “\add It seems you’ve sold your soul by doing what Yahweh’s finds to be evil\add*.
\v 21 \add Yahweh says that\add* \add he’s about to send disaster on you to destroy\add* you and \add every male in your household—whether they’re slaves or free\add*.
\v 22 Your \add entire\add* \add family will be eliminated\add* like the families of Nebat’s son Yarave’am and Ahiyyah’s son Baasha because you’ve provoked \add Yahweh’s\add* anger and made Israel sin.
\v 23 Also concerning Izevel, Yahweh says that the dogs will eat \add her body\add* by Yezreel’s \add city\add* \add wall\add*.\x + \xo 21:23: \xt 2Ki 9:36.\x*
\v 24 \add The bodies of\add* any of your family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and any who die in the countryside will be eaten by birds.”
\p
\v 25 Surely there was never \add anyone else as evil as Ahav who sold his soul by doing what Yahweh was said was wrong—albeit often\add* incited by his wife Izevel.
\v 26 He \add also\add* behaved disgustingly by \add worshipping\add* idols like the Amorites had done \add before\add* Yahweh \add removed them from the land as the Israelis entered\add*.
\p
\v 27 As soon as Ahav heard that message, he tore his clothes and dressed in sacking and fasted. He \add even\add* slept in the sackcloth, and he walked around \add slowly\add* \add with his head down\add*.
\p
\v 28 Then Yahweh \add asked\add* Eliyyah (from Tishbe),
\v 29 “Have you \add noticed\add* that Ahav has \add shown repentance towards me\add*? Because he’s humbled himself, I won’t bring \add that disaster on his family while he’s still alive\add*, \add but rather\add* I’ll do \add it\add* \add during his son’s reign\add*.”
\c 22
\s1 prophet Mikayehu and King Ahav
\r (2 Chr. 18:2-27)
\p
\v 1 Then \add almost\add* three years went by without war between Aram \add (Syria)\add* and Israel,
\v 2 \add but\add* in the third year, Yehudah’s King Yehoshafat went \add up north\add* to visit Israel’s king.
\p
\v 3 \add While they were talking,\add* King Ahav said to his servants, “Do you know that Ramot-Gilead \add should be ours, but we haven’t reclaimed\add* it from Aram’s king?”
\v 4 Then he \add asked\add* Yehoshafat, “Will you go to war \add with us to reclaim\add* Ramot-Gilead?”
\p “\add You and me are together\add*,” Yehoshafat told Israel’s king. “\add My people are your people, and my horses are your horses\add*.”
\v 5 \add Then he added\add*, “\add But let’s ask Yahweh\add* \add about it first\add*.”
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* Israel’s king gathered about four hundred prophets together and asked them, “Should I \add attack\add* Ramot-Gilead, or \add not\add*?”
\p “Go \add ahead\add*, because \add our\add* master\f + \fr 22:6 \ft Note that they don’t mention ‘Yahweh’ here.\f* will give \add you victory\add*,” they \add answered\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add But\add* Yehoshafat \add asked\add*, “Is there no prophet of Yahweh still \add around\add* here \add that we can ask\add*?”
\p
\v 8 “There’s still one man \add who speaks for\add* Yahweh,” \add Ahav\add* \add replied\add* to Yehoshafat, “Yimla’s son Mikayehu, but I myself hate him because he \add never prophesies anything\add* good about me—\add only negative things\add*.”
\p “The king shouldn’t \add talk like that\add*,” said Yehoshafat.
\p
\v 9 \add So\add* Israel’s king \add ordered an offical to fetch Yimla’s son Mikayehu straight away\add*.
\p
\v 10 \add Now\add* Israel’s king \add Ahav\add* and Yehudah’s king Yehoshafat were \add both wearing their royal robes and sitting on thrones at a gate in Shomron’s city wall, and many prophets were speaking messages to them\add*.
\v 11 Kenaanah’s son Tsidkiyyah made \add some horns for himself out of iron\add* and said, “Yahweh says that you’ll gore Aram with these until they’re destroyed.”
\v 12 All the \add other\add* prophets were prophesying \add similarly\add*, saying \add things like\add*, “\add Yes,\add* \add attack\add* Ramot-Gilead and be successful, and Yahweh will \add restore it back to you\add*.”
\p
\v 13 \add Meanwhile\add* the messenger who had gone to call Mikayehu told him, “Listen, please, \add all the other prophets agree together as they prophesy victory for\add* the king. Please let your message be \add similar to theirs\add* and \add be positive\add*.”
\p
\v 14 “As surely as Yahweh lives,” Mikayehu \add responded\add*, “I’ll only tell Ahav what Yahweh tells me to say.”
\p
\v 15 \add When\add* he got to King \add Ahav\add*, the king asked him, “Mikayehu, should we \add attack\add* Ramot-Gilead, or \add not\add*?”
\p “Go \add ahead\add* and be successful,” he \add replied\add*, “and Yahweh will give \add it back to\add* the king.”
\p
\v 16 \add But\add* \add looking at him,\add* the king said to him, “How many times do I have to make you promise that you’ll \add only tell the truth about me when you pass on Yahweh’s messages\add*?
\p
\v 17 “\add Well,\add*” he said, “I saw all Israel scattered into the hills like \add sheep\add* without a shepherd, and Yahweh said \add that they have no leaders so they should all return peacefully to their homes\add*.”\x + \xo 22:17: \xt Num 27:17; Mat 9:36; Mrk 6:34.\x*
\p
\v 18 “\add Ah,\add*” King \add Ahav\add* told \add King\add* Yehoshafat, “Didn’t I tell you that he wouldn’t prophesy \add anything\add* good about me—\add only bad news\add*?”
\p
\v 19 \add But\add* \add Mikayehu\add* \add continued\add*, “Listen to Yahweh’s message then: I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne, and all the heavenly army were standing at \add both sides of him\add*.\x + \xo 22:19: \xt Yob 1:6; Isa 6:1.\x*
\v 20 Then Yahweh \add asked\add* who could deceive Ahav to \add attack\add* Ramot-Gilead so that he’d get killed there. \add Some suggested one thing and others suggested something else\add*.
\v 21 Then a spirit came out and stood \add in front of\add* Yahweh and offered to deceive \add the king\add*, and Yahweh \add asked\add* him \add how he intended to do it\add*.
\v 22 He \add replied that he’d go and be a false spirit so the kings prophets would tell lies\add*, and Yahweh \add said that that would work and told him to go ahead and do it\add*.
\v 23 \add So\add* now, listen, Yahweh has \add put a lying a spirit into\add* all these prophets of yours, and Yahweh has \add declared disaster on\add* you.”
\p
\v 24 Then Tsidkiyyah (Kenaanah’s son) \add went over and slapped Mikayehu on the face\add*, and said, “\add Since when did Yahweh’s spirit leave me and start speaking through\add* you?”
\p
\v 25 “Listen \add here\add*,” Mikayehu replied, “you’ll \add find that out soon enough when you sneak into an inner room to try and hide\add*.”
\p
\v 26 King \add Ahav commanded\add*, “Take Mikayehu to Amon, the city commander, and to \add my\add* son Yoash.
\v 27 Tell \add them that the king orders them to imprison this man and limit his bread and water until I return safely\add*.”
\p
\v 28 “If you do return safely,” Mikayehu \add remarked\add*, “then Yahweh hasn’t spoken through me.” And he \add added\add*, “\add Take note all you people\add*.”
\s1 Ahav’s death
\r (2 Chr. 18:28-34)
\p
\v 29 \add So\add* so Israel’s King \add Ahav\add* and Yehudah’s King Yehoshafat \add left to go and attack\add* Ramot-Gilead,
\v 30 and \add Ahav\add* told Yehoshafat, “I’ll \add go into the battle incognito, but\add* you can wear your \add royal robes\add*.” \add So\add* Israel’s king \add changed into ordinary clothes before heading\add* into the battle.
\p
\v 31 \add Meanwhile,\add* Aram’s king had ordered his thirty-two chariot commanders, “\add Don’t fight with the rank and file—only attack Israel’s king\add*.”
\v 32 As soon as the chariot commanders saw Yehudah’s King Yehoshafat, they \add thought\add* to themselves, “Surely that’s Israel’s king.” \add So then they came over to attack\add* him, but Yehoshafat yelled out,
\v 33 and as soon as \add they\add* realised that he wasn’t the king of Israel, they \add stopped chasing him\add*.
\v 34 But one man casually \add shot an arrow with his\add* and \add it\add* struck Israel’s king between the \add plates of his\add* body armour, and he called to his \add chariot driver\add*, “Turn \add around and get me out of the battle\add* because I’ve been wounded.”
\p
\v 35 The battle \add carried on all\add* that day and King \add Ahav\add* was \add propped\add* up in \add his\add* chariot opposite Aram, \add however\add* he died that evening and the blood from his wound \add pooled into the bottom of his\add* the chariot.
\v 36 Then the \add call went through the battle lines just as the sun was doing down, “\add Every\add* man \add should abandon the battlefield and\add* return to his home\add*”
\p
\v 37 \add So\add* King \add Ahav\add* died and \add was taken back\add* to Shomron \add where he was\add* buried.
\v 38 They washed out the chariot beside the pool in Shomron (where the prostitutes bathed themselves), and dogs licked up the blood, \add just as Yahweh had said would happen\add*.
\p
\v 39 \add Everything else about Ahav and everything that he did, including the ivory palace and all the cities that he had built, is written in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Israel.
\v 40 \add Now that Ahav was dead, his son Ahazyah replaced him as king\add*.
\s1 Yehoshafat’s reign over Yehudah
\r (2 Chr. 20:31–21:1)
\p
\v 41 Asa’s son Yehoshafat \add started\add* \add his reign\add* over Yehudah when King Ahav \add had ruled\add* Israel for four years.
\v 42 Yehoshafat was thirty-five when he \add became king\add* and he reigned from Yerushalem for twenty-five years. (His mother was Shilhi’s daughter Azuvah.)
\v 43 He \add followed\add* his father Asa in every way in doing \add what Yahweh wanted\add*—he didn’t \add veer\add* away from it, except that they didn’t \add demolish the hilltop temples so\add* the people were still sacrificing and burning incense at \add those\add* places.
\v 44 Yehoshafat did make \add a peace treaty\add* with Israel’s king.
\p
\v 45 \add Everything else about Yehoshafat, \add including his great achievements and his battle record\add*, is written in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Yehudah,
\v 46 and \add including how\add* he \add banished\add* the male prostitutes from the land who had remained from the time of his father Asa.
\p
\v 47 \add At that time,\add* there was no king in Edom—a governor \add appointed by Yehoshafat\add* ruled there.
\p
\v 48 Yehoshafat \add had trading ships made\add* to go to Ophir for gold, but \add they\add* didn’t go because the ships \add got wrecked\add* at Etsyon-Gaver.
\v 49 Ahav’s son Ahazyah had said to Yehoshafat, “Let my servants go with your servants in the ships.” \add But\add* Yehoshafat hadn’t \add accepted the offer\add*.
\p
\v 50 Then Yehoshafat \add died\add* and was buried with his ancestors in the City of his ancestor David, and his son Yehoram \add replaced him as king\add*.
\s1 Ahazyah’s reign over Israel
\p
\v 51 Ahav’s son Ahazyah \add began to\add* reign over Israel from Samaria in the seventeenth year of King Yehoshafat’s \add reign over\add* Yehudah, and he reigned over Israel for two years.
\v 52 He followed the \add behaviour\add* of his father and mother and Nebat’s son Yarave’am, and did \add what Yahweh had said was\add* evil—causing Israel to sin \add like they had\add*.
\v 53 He served Baal and bowed down to him, and he provoked Israel’s God Yahweh to \add get angry, similarly to everything\add* that his father had done.
