\mt3 (meaning ‘The group leader’)
\is1 Introduction
\ip This collection of \bk Reflections\bk* (commonly called \bk Ecclesiastes\bk*), was written by a wise leader. Some of the proverbs here were written by King Shelomoh (Solomon), but there’s also proverbs from other writers. The authors of these thought carefully about the meaning of life. They looked at everything that happens here in the world (‘under the sun’) to discover its purpose and to try to understand the meaning of life. They advise that it’s necessary to respect and obey Yahweh, to strive to find happiness in our daily lives. (The meaning of Ecclesiastes is ‘The group leader’. The title commonly used in English is a Latin transliteration of the Greek translation of the Hebrew word קֹהֶלֶת.) In Hebrew texts, this document is grouped in with ‘The Writings (Ketuvim)’.

\v 1 \add The following\add* are the words of the leader,\f + \fr 1:1 \ft We don’t have enough information to fully understand the meaning of the Hebrew word ‘קֹהֶ֣לֶת’ (Kohelet), but it probably means something like ‘leader/speaker of the assembly’, so we use ‘the leader’ throughout this document.\f* David’s son, king in Yerushalem \add (Jerusalem)\add*:
\s1 Everything’s meaningless
\q1
\v 2 “Totally pointless,” says the leader.
\q1 “\add A complete waste of time\add*. Everything’s worthless.”
\q1
\v 3 What profit does humanity gain from all \add their hard work in this world\add*?
\q1
\v 4 \add Generations come, and generations go\add*,
\q1 \add but the world just carries on going\add*.
\q1
\v 5 The sun rises and the sun sets,
\q1 then \add rushes\add* \add around\add* to its place, rising there \add again\add*.
\q1
\v 6 Going to the south then around to the north,
\q1 the wind is going, changing, turning,
\q1 then \add it’s\add* returning on its rounds.
\q1
\v 7 All the rivers \add flow into\add* the sea \add but it never gets\add* full.
\q1 The place that the rivers are going to, they \add end up\add* going \add there\add* again.
\q1
\v 8 Everything is wearisome—\add not even worth talking about\add*.
\q1 The \add eyes\add* \add never stop\add* seeing,
\q1 and \add your\add* \add ears\add* \add never fill up with everything they hear\add*.
\q1
\v 9 Whatever that was \add in the past\add*, it will be \add in the future\add*,
\q1 and \add everything that’s happened before, will happen\add* \add again\add*.
\q1 There’s nothing new \add in this world\add*.\f + \fr 1:9 \ft ‘Under the sun’ isn’t a natural English idiom\f*.
\q1
\v 10 If someone says, “Look at this—it’s new,”
\q1 \add well\add*, it was already done \add long ago before we even got here\add*.
\q1
\v 11 \add Things that happened in the past get forgotten\add*,
\q1 and \add the same will also happen for future events\add*.
\q1 \add People in the future will be exactly the same\add*.
\s1 The persecution of wise
\q1
\v 12 I, the leader, was king over Yisrael in Yerushalem.
\q1
\v 13 I \add used my mind and\add* wisdom to discover and to explore everything that is done \add in this world\add*.
\q1 It’s a difficult job that God has given humanity to be busy with.
\q1
\v 14 I saw all the deeds that are done \add in this world\add*,
\q1 and look—everything’s pointless \add like\add* chasing after the wind.
\q1
\v 15 Something that’s bent can’t be straightened \add again\add*,
\q1 and what’s missing can’t be counted.
\q1
\v 16 I spoke with \add sincerity\add*, saying, “Look at me—I’ve become \add powerful\add*,
\q1 and I’ve \add increased in wisdom relative to everyone who ruled before me\add* \add here\add* in Yerushalem.\x + \xo 1:16: \xt 1Ki 4:29-31.\x*
\q1 \add My mind has acquired\add* much knowledge and wisdom.”
\q1
\v 17 I \add made it my aim to discover\add* knowledge and wisdom \add versus\add* madness and folly.
\q1 I was aware that that also is chasing after the wind
\q1
\v 18 because \add having much wisdom leads to much frustration\add*
\q1 and anyone who’s adding knowledge is \add also\add* adding pain.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 I said \add to myself\add*,
\q1 “Come on, let me \add find out what’s good and enjoy the pleasure from them\add*.”
\q1 But look, it was also pointless.
\q1
\v 2 To laughter, I said, “It’s madness,”
\q1 and to joy, “What’s \add the point of this\add*?”
\q1
\v 3 I explored in myself how to \add indulge my body\add* with wine, but my \add mind\add* was guiding me in wisdom.
\q1 \add Also,\add* how to grasp foolishness
\q1 until I could see whether that’s better for humanity to do \add while they live out their lives here on this earth\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 4 I expanded my \add program of works\add*.
\q1 I built houses for myself.
\q1 I planted vineyards for myself.\x + \xo 2:4-8: \xt 1Ki 10:23-27; 2Ch 9:22-27.\x*
\q1
\v 5 I made gardens for myself, and royal parks,
\q1 and I planted \add all different kinds\add* of fruit trees in them.
\q1
\v 6 I constructed pools for myself
\q1 to \add irrigate\add* a forest of growing trees.
\q1
\v 7 I acquired male and female servants,
\q1 and \add the children born to them\add* belonged to me.
\q1 Also \add a large number\add* of sheep and cattle belonged to me—
\q1 more than all \add my predecessors\add* in Yerushalem.\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 1Ki 4:23.\x*
\q1
\v 8 I also accumulated gold and silver for myself,
\q1 and treasure from kings and from the provinces.
\q1 I appointed male and female singers for myself,
\q1 and the pleasures of the sons of humanity—\add many women\add*.\x + \xo 2:8: \xt 1Ki 10:10,14-22.\x*
\b
\q1
\v 9 \add So I became famous\add*,
\q1 and I added more than all who \add preceded me\add* in Yerushalem.
\q1 Also my wisdom stayed with me.\x + \xo 2:9: \xt 1Ch 29:25.\x*
\q1
\v 10 \add Everything my eyes wanted\add*, I \add gave\add* them.
\q1 I didn’t \add hold back\add* from \add anything that would make me happy\add*,
\q1 because \add I was happy inside\add* from all my work
\q1 and that was my reward from all my effort.
\q1
\v 11 And I turned, I, to all \add the things that I’d made\add*
\q1 and to the work that I’d done,
\q1 and look, everything was pointless and chasing after the wind,
\q1 and there wasn’t any profit \add in anything done in this world\add*.
\p
\v 12 Then I \add changed direction to investigate\add* wisdom and madness and folly,
\q1 because what could \add any future\add* king do that hasn’t already been done?
\q1
\v 13 I saw that wisdom \add is to be preferred over\add* folly,
\q1 just as light \add is to be preferred\add* over darkness.
\q1
\v 14 \add The wise person uses their\add* eyes,
\q1 \add but\add* the fool walks in the darkness,
\q1 and even I know that \add the same fate comes\add* to both of them.
\q1
\v 15 I said \add to myself\add*, “\add The fool’s end will also come\add* to me,
\q1 \add so what use was it being\add* so wise back then?”
\q1 Then I \add told myself\add* that that also is pointless,
\q1
\v 16 because \add neither the wise person nor the fool will be remembered forever\add*,
\q1 \add as they’ll both be forgotten in the days to come\add*—
\q1 and how \add strange it is\add* that the wise die \add just like\add* the fool!
\q1
\v 17 Then I hated life because of the misfortune around me—
\q1 the work that was done \add in this world\add*,
\q1 because everything was pointless and chasing after the wind.
\p
\v 18 Then I hated all the work that I’d done \add in this world\add*
\q1 that will get left to those who follow me \add after I go\add*.
\q1
\v 19 And who knows whether \add my successor\add* will be wise or a fool?
\q1 He’ll have authority over all my \add projects\add* that I \add worked hard on\add*
\q1 and which I’ve \add applied wisdom to in this world\add*.
\q1 That also was pointless.
\q1
\v 20 Then I \add changed\add* to despairing over all the \add projects in this world that I’d worked hard on\add*,
\q1
\v 21 because there \add are people\add* whose work is in wisdom and knowledge, and in skill.
\q1 \add However,\add* then a person who hasn’t worked on it, will \add gain it as their inheritance\add*.
\q1 That also is pointless and a great misfortune
\q1
\v 22 because what does a person get in exchange for all their work and \add their goals in life that they work towards in this world\add*?
\q1
\v 23 Because all his days are painful, and anger is his business—
\q1 even in the night, his \add mind\add* doesn’t rest.
\q1 That also is pointless.\x + \xo 2:23: \xt Yob 5:7; 14:1.\x*
\q1
\v 24 There’s nothing better for humanity other than eating and drinking,
\q1 and \add genuinely enjoying their hard work\add*.
\q1 Also I saw that that comes from God\x + \xo 2:24: \xt Ecc 3:13; 5:18; 9:7; Isa 56:12; Luk 12:19; 1Cor 15:32.\x*
\q1
\v 25 because who could eat and enjoy \add life\add* apart from him?
\q1
\v 26 \add Yes,\add* he gives wisdom and knowledge and happiness to \add people who are good in his sight\add*.
\q1 But to the sinner, he gives the job of gathering and collecting to give to the one who’s good \add in God’s sight\add*.
\q1 That also is pointless and chasing after the wind.\x + \xo 2:26: \xt Yob 32:8; Prv 2:6.\x*
\c 3
\s1 A right time for everything
\p
\v 1 There’s an appointed time for everything,
\q1 and an appropriate time for every activity \add in this world\add*:
\q1
\v 2 A time to give birth and a time to die.
\q1 A time to plant and a time to pull out what was planted.
\q1
\v 3 A time to kill and a time to heal.
\q1 A time to tear down and a time to build up.
\q1
\v 4 A time to cry and a time to laugh.
\q1 A time to mourn and a time to dance.
\q1
\v 5 A time to throw stones and a time to pick up stones.
\q1 A time to embrace and a time to avoid embracing.
\q1
\v 6 A time to search and a time to lose.
\q1 A time to keep and a time to toss out.
\q1
\v 7 A time to tear and a time to mend.
\q1 A time to be silent and a time to speak up.
\q1
\v 8 A time to love and a time to hate.
\q1 A time for war and a time for peace.
\s1 Enjoying life and work
\p
\v 9 What \add do people gain from all the work they do\add*?
\q2
\v 10 I’ve seen the task that God has given people to \add keep them occupied\add*.
\q1
\v 11 \add God\add* makes everything \add happen at the appropriate\add* time.
\q1 Also, he puts \add the awareness of\add* eternity into \add the human mind\add*,
\q1 yet humanity can’t grasp \add what\add* God has done from \add the\add* beginning to \add the\add* end.
\q1
\v 12 I know that there’s nothing better for them
\q1 than being cheerful and doing good during \add their lives\add*
\q1
\v 13 and everyone should eat and drink and see good in \add everything they do\add*—
\q1 that’s a gift from God.
\q1
\v 14 I know that everything God does will be enduring.
\q1 There’s nothing that needs to be added to it, or taken away,
\q1 and God has \add done it like that so that people will respect and want to obey him\add*.
\q1
\v 15 Whatever there is, it already was,
\q1 and whatever is to be, it already is,
\q1 and God will \add watch whatever’s being worked on\add*.
\s1 Not/None correct judging here of world
\q1
\v 16 Then again I saw \add in this world\add* at the place of judgement, there was wickedness,
\q1 and at the place of righteousness, there was wickedness.
\q1
\v 17 I said \add to myself\add*, “God will judge the righteous and the wicked,
\q1 because there’s a time for every matter, and \add for every action to be judged\add*.”
\q1
\v 18 I said \add to myself\add*, “God tests humanity
\q1 so they can see that they themselves are \add like\add* animals
\q1
\v 19 because the \add same one thing happens to both people and animals\add*:
\q1 \add just like one dies, so does the other\add*—they both have the same breath.
\q1 \add But people have no\add* advantage over \add animals\add*—everything is pointless.
\q1
\v 20 Both go to \add the same\add* place—
\q1 both \add came\add* from the dust and both return to the dust.
\q1
\v 21 Who can know that a \add person’s\add* spirit is the one going up—upwards,
\q1 and the animal’s spirit is the one going down—downwards to the earth?
\q1
\v 22 Then I saw that there is nothing better than that \add people\add* would enjoy their work,
\q1 because \add that’s their assignment\add*.
\q1 \add Yes,\add* who can \add see what will happen to them after they die\add*?
\c 4
\p
\v 1 Then I turned and I saw all the oppression \add around the world\add*,
\q1 and, look, see the tears of the oppressed
\q1 \add but\add* there was \add no one to comfort\add* them.
\q1 \add The oppressors exerted their power against them\add*,
\q1 \add but there was no one to comfort the oppressed\add*.
\q1
\v 2 So I praised those who were dead—who’ve already died,
\q1 more than the living—those who are still alive.
\q1
\v 3 \add But\add* better than both of them, is the one who hasn’t yet lived—
\q1 who hasn’t seen the evil things that are being done \add in this world\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 4 Then I \add noticed all the skills used and the work that gets done\add*,
\q1 \add but also\add* \add saw\add* that it \add raised the envy of others\add*.
\q1 That is also pointless and chasing after the wind.
\q1
\v 5 The fool folds his hands \add together instead of working\add*
\q1 and \add ends up\add* \add ruining himself\add*.
\q1
\v 6 A \add small handful\add* of quietness is better
\q1 than \add two very full handfuls of\add* work and chasing after the wind.
\q1
\v 7 Then I turned and I saw a pointless thing \add in this world\add*:
\q1
\v 8 \add Sometimes there’s a person living alone without a child or a relative, who works hard without stopping\add*.
\q1 \add However, wealth doesn’t satisfy them because they wonder why they’re working so hard and not sitting down to enjoy their good things\add*.
\q1 That also is pointless, and it’s an unpleasant business.
\q1
\v 9 Two \add people\add* are better than one.
\q1 because \add their working together can give a better result\add*.
\q1
\v 10 \add Yes,\add* if they fall, one \add person\add* can help his companion up,
\q1 \add but it wouldn’t end so well\add* if one \add person\add* falls \add alone\add*
\q1 and there’s no second \add person\add* to \add help them\add*.
\q1
\v 11 Similarly, if two \add people\add* lie down together, they can \add help each other\add* stay warm,
\q1 \add but\add* how can one \add person\add* stay warm \add by themself\add*?
\q1
\v 12 And even if one \add person\add* would be easily overpowered,
\q1 two people could stand against \add an attacker\add*.
\q1 A three-stranded rope can’t be \add easily broken\add*.
\q1
\v 13 A poor but wise youth is better \add off\add*
\q1 than an old but foolish king who \add can’t accept\add* advice,
\q1
\v 14 because \add coming from a family who’d spent time in prison\add*, he \add made it\add* to become king—yet even in his kingdom he was born poor.
\q1
\v 15 I saw all those walking around \add in this world\add* with the next child who will \add rule after\add* him—
\q1
\v 16 there was no end to all the people \add who’ve ruled before them\add*.
\q1 Even the ones who \add follow him won’t speak kindly about\add* him,
\q1 because even that is pointless and chasing after the wind.
\c 5
\s1 Be careful of your words
\p
\v 1 \add Watch your step\add* when you go to God’s house.
\q1 \add Going in\add* to listen is better than fools who offer \add sacrifices\add*,
\q1 because they don’t \add realise\add* that what they’re doing \add there\add* is evil.
\q1
\v 2 Don’t \add speak out too quickly\add*,
\q1 and don’t let your \add emotions rush to make you request something from\add* God,
\q1 because God is in the heavens,
\q1 but you’re on the earth, so let your words be few.
\q1
\v 3 A dream \add can lead to a lot of panic\add*,
\q1 and a fool’s voice brings many words.
\q1
\v 4 When you \add promise something\add* to God,
\q1 don’t \add put off doing what you promised\add*
\q1 because \add no one likes\add* fools.
\q1 Whatever you promise, do it!\x + \xo 5:4: \xt Psa 66:13-14.\x*
\q1
\v 5 It’s better not to make a promise
\q1 than to promise something and then not do it.
\q1
\v 6 Don’t allow your mouth to cause your \add whole\add* body to sin,
\q1 and don’t tell the \add temple\add* messenger that it was an unintentional sin.
\q1 Why \add make God angry by what you say\add*
\q1 and destroy the \add good\add* \add things that you’ve done\add*?
\q1
\v 7 \add Yes, there’s\add* many dreams and pointless things and many words—
\q1 just \add respect and strive to obey\add* God.
\s1 Not/None purpose of wealth
\p
\v 8 If you see the extortion of the poor
\q1 and the \add perversion\add* of justice and righteousness in the \add provinces\add*,
\q1 don’t be amazed about it because a high \add official\add* is watching over another \add official\add*,
\q1 and higher \add ones\add* are watching over them.
\q1
\v 9 \add Land is an advantage for everyone—the king gets served from the countryside\add*.
\q1
\v 10 A person who loves \add money\add* won’t be satisfied with \add it\add*,
\q1 and whoever loves wealth \add won’t be satisfied\add* with their income.
\q1 That’s also pointless.
\q1
\v 11 When \add material\add* goods increase, people’s consumption increases,
\q1 and what advantage does the owner get \add other than just feeding\add* his eyes?
\q1
\v 12 The labourer has a pleasant sleep, whether they’ve had a lot to eat or just a little,
\q1 ^\add but\add* the \add many investments\add* of the rich person don’t permit them to sleep.
\q1
\v 13 There’s a \add sad contradiction\add* that I’ve seen \add in this world\add*:
\q1 wealth \add hoarded up\add* by its \add owner, but working to destroy him\add*.
\q1
\v 14 Then that wealth \add was lost in a failed investment\add*
\q1 and \add although\add* he \add had\add* a son, he had nothing left \add to live on\add*.
\q1
\v 15 \add He was naked when he was born and he’ll be naked when he goes again\add*,
\q1 and \add despite all his hard work\add*, he won’t \add be able to\add* take any \add money with him\add*.\x + \xo 5:15: \xt Yob 1:21; Psa 49:17; 1Tim 6:7.\x*
\q1
\v 16 This is also a sickening misfortune:
\q1 He will leave \add this world\add* just like he entered \add it\add*,
\q1 and what profit belongs to him who will work hard for the wind?
\q1
\v 17 What’s more, all his \add life\add* he’ll eat in darkness,
\q1 and in a lot of distress, as well as sickness and anger.
\q1
\v 18 Listen, this is what I myself have discovered to be good:
\q1 It’s good \add for a person\add* to eat and drink
\q1 and to see benefit in all the hard work that they’ll do \add in this world\add*
\q1 during the number of the days of their life that God has given \add that person\add*,
\q1 because that’s their allocation \add in life\add*.
\q1
\v 19 Also, each person who’s been given wealth and possessions by God and has been empowered
\q1 to eat from it
\q1 and to accept their allocation \add in life\add*
\q1 and to enjoy their hard work:
\q1 that’s a gift from God.
\q1
\v 20 Those people don’t retain a memory of each day \add that passed\add*
\q1 because God keeps them full of internal happiness.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 There’s a problem \add in this world\add*
\q1 and it \add troubles people\add*:
\q2
\v 2 God gives wealth and possessions and prestige to someone,
\q1 and \add that person\add* \add has access to everything they want\add*,
\q1 but God doesn’t \add allow them to enjoy\add* it—
\q1 instead a foreigner will \add get to enjoy\add* it.
\q1 That’s \add totally\add* pointless, and it’s \add senseless and unfair\add*.
\q1
\v 3 If a man should father a hundred children
\q1 and live many years however \add long his life might be\add*,
\q1 but \add he’s not satisfied in himself\add* by his prosperity
\q1 and \add he doesn’t have anywhere to be buried\add*,
\q1 \add then I’d say that a stillborn child would have been better off than him\add*,
\q1
\v 4 because \add that child\add* came for no reason
\q1 and it went in darkness, and its name will be covered in darkness.
\q1
\v 5 It didn’t even see the sun or know about it.
\q1 It’ll rest easier than that man will.
\q1
\v 6 Even if \add that man\add* lived a thousand years twice over,
\q1 but \add never saw good in anything\add*,
\q1 aren’t they both going to \add the same\add* place?
\b
\q1
\v 7 All of humanity’s work is for their mouth,
\q1 \add but the inner cravings are never fulfilled\add*.
\q1
\v 8 \add So\add* what advantage does a wise \add person\add* have over a fool?
\q1 \add What advantage\add* does a poor \add person’s\add* \add knowledge\add* give them over others?
\q1
\v 9 \add It’s better to enjoy what’s right there than to feed the imagination\add*.
\q1 That’s also pointless and chasing after the wind.
\q1
\v 10 Everything that existed has already been named.
\q1 It’s known what humankind is
\q1 and that \add humans\add* can’t dispute with the \add one\add* who’s stronger than them.
\q1
\v 11 \add Yes,\add* many words \add just\add* become more pointless.
\q1 What advantage is that to anyone?
\q1
\v 12 Who knows what’s good for a person
\q1 for those pointless days that he/she lives?
\q1 The days pass by like a shadow
\q1 \add but\add* who can tell anyone what will happen to them next \add in this world\add*?
\c 7
\s1 The life
\p
\v 1 A \add good\add* reputation is better than expensive perfume,\x + \xo 7:1: \xt Prv 22:1.\x*
\q1 and the day you die \add is more important\add* than the day of your birth.
\q1
\v 2 It’s better to go to a house where there’s mourning than to a house where there’s a party,
\q1 because \add death\add* is the end of each person,
\q1 and those still alive should consider this in their hearts.
\q1
\v 3 Laughter is better than grief
\q1 because a \add serious face means that the mind is working\add*.
\q1
\v 4 Wise people \add do their thinking at a funeral\add*,
\q1 \add whereas foolish people prefer to spend time at a party\add*.
\q1
\v 5 It’s better to accept a rebuke from a wise person
\q1 than to listen to the songs from foolish people,
\q1
\v 6 because the laughter of a fool
\q1 is like the crackling of \add burning\add* thorn \add twigs\add* under a cooking pot—
\q1 that’s also pointless.
\q1
\v 7 Oppression drives a wise person insane,
\q1 and a bribe destroys a \add person’s morals\add*.
\q1
\v 8 \add Finishing something is better than starting it\add*,
\q1 \add and\add* \add being patient is better than being proud\add*.
\q1
\v 9 Don’t be quick to get angry,\x + \xo 7:9: \xt Jam 1:19.\x*
\q1 because anger \add belongs in a fool’s toolbox\add*.
\q1
\v 10 Don’t \add ask\add*, “What was it about the old days that were better than these?”
\q1 because \add that question doesn’t display\add* wisdom.
\q1
\v 11 Wisdom is good \add when you get\add* an inheritance,
\q1 and it’s an advantage to \add those doing well\add*.
\q1
\v 12 Wisdom can protect us just like \add money\add* can,
\q1 \add but\add* the advantage of knowledge is that wisdom preserves \add the life of\add* its owner.
\q1
\v 13 Look at God’s work:
\q1 who can straighten what he’s made crooked?
\q1
\v 14 Be happy on a good day,
\q1 \add but\add* on a day of problems, consider this:
\q1 God \add caused one, as well as the other\add*—
\q1 humanity can’t discover \add what’s going to come next\add*.
\p
\v 15 I’ve seen everything in my days of pointlessness:
\q1 There’s \add godly\add* people \add dying despite doing everything right\add*,
\q1 and there are wicked people \add living long lives doing\add* evil.
\q1
\v 16 Don’t be highly righteous or overly wise—
\q1 Why \add go to the trouble of\add* destroying yourself?
\q1
\v 17 Don’t be very wicked and don’t be a fool—
\q1 why should you die when it’s not your time?
\q1
\v 18 It’s good to take hold of \add wisdom\add* and don’t rest from \add doing what is right\add*,
\q1 because the godly person should continue with both of them.
\q1
\v 19 Wisdom gives strength to the wise—
\q1 more than the ten most powerful men in the city.
\q1
\v 20 \add But yes,\add* there’s no person on the earth who’s \add truly good\add*,
\q1 \add only\add* doing what is right and never disobeying.
\q1
\v 21 Don’t give your attention to everything that people say,
\q1 \add otherwise\add* you might hear your servant \add speaking against\add* you,
\q1
\v 22 because you know how often you’ve belittled others \add yourself\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 23 I tested all of that with wisdom.
\q1 I said, “Let me be wise,” but it \add eluded\add* me.
\q1
\v 24 \add It seemed\add* far away
\q1 and deeper down than anyone can find.
\q1
\v 25 I \add changed my mind’s direction\add* to \add try to\add* learn and explore—
\q1 to search for wisdom and \add to understand how things work\add*,
\q1 and to \add understand the foolishness of wickedness and how that leads to\add* madness.
\b
\q1
\v 26 I \add learnt that\add* a woman who \add takes advantage\add* of you \add leads to more bitterness than death would be\add*—
\q1 her heart is like a net and her hands become chains.
\q1 Any person that’s good in God’s \add eyes\add* would escape from her,
\q1 \add but an ungodly person\add* would \add end up\add* captured by her.
\q1
\v 27 The leader has discovered that—
\q1 \add adding\add* one thing to another to \add try to\add* find \add an explanation for everything\add*.
\q1
\v 28 I continually \add tried to learn more\add*, but I didn’t find it.
\q1 I found one \add special\add* man out of a thousand
\q1 but I couldn’t find one \add such\add* woman out of all of them.
\q1
\v 29 This is the only \add conclusion\add* I came to:
\q1 God made humankind to \add do good, but\add* \add instead\add* they’ve come up with many \add other kinds of\add* schemes.
\c 8
\p
\v 1 Who’s like the wise person and \add understands what’s going on\add*?
\q1 A person’s wisdom \add makes their face lighten up\add*
\q1 and \add gives their face a certain firmness\add*.
\q1
\v 2 Follow the king’s orders
\q1 because of your promise to God.
\q1
\v 3 Don’t rush away from \add the king’s\add* presence
\q1 \add or\add* take a stand on an evil matter
\q1 because whatever he wants to do, he’ll do.
\q1
\v 4 A king’s word is authoritative—
\q1 who’ll ask him \add what he thinks\add* he’s doing?
\q1
\v 5 Those who follow commands will \add stay out of trouble\add*,
\q1 and a wise person will know \add the right time and place\add* for something
\q1
\v 6 because there’s a time and a \add right way to do everything\add*,
\q1 \add otherwise\add* humanity’s misery will be severe.
\q1
\v 7 No one knows \add what the future will bring\add*
\q1 \add so\add* no one can tell you \add what will happen\add* \add next\add*.
\q1
\v 8 \add Just as\add* no person has control over the wind to be able to restrain it,
\q1 nor does anyone have authority over the day of \add their\add* death.
\q1 \add Just as\add* no one can be discharged in \add the middle of a\add* war,
\q1 nor can being wicked rescue you \add from your situation\add*.
\p
\v 9 I saw all that and applied my mind to \add everything that happens in this world\add*.
\q1 \add I saw\add* that sometimes a person can dominate \add someone else to that person’s detriment\add*.
\q1
\v 10 I’ve seen wicked \add people\add* being buried—
\q1 being \add carried\add* out from a sacred place,
\q1 and \add what they’d done\add* there in the city was \add just\add* forgotten.
\q1 That’s also pointless.
\q1
\v 11 When an evil activity isn’t quickly condemned,
\q1 then humanity will become totally determined to do evil.
\q1
\v 12 \add Even if\add* \add an ungodly person\add* does some evil thing a hundred times \add over\add* and \add goes on to\add* live a long time,
\q1 I know that things will go better \add for those who respect and obey\add* God.
\q1
\v 13 It won’t go well for the wicked and \add what they do\add* \add won’t help them live longer\add*
\q1 because they’ve shown no respect for God’s presence.
\q1
\v 14 There’s something else strange that happens in this world:
\q1 when bad things happen to godly people
\q1 and when good things happen to evil people.
\q1 That’s also hard to understand.
\q1
\v 15 Then I recommended enjoyment
\q1 because there’s nothing better for a person \add in this world\add* than to eat and drink and be cheery,
\q1 then \add that attitude\add* will be with them as they work
\q1 during the days of their life that God gives them \add in this world\add*.
\p
\v 16 So when I \add set my mind\add* on gaining wisdom
\q1 and observing all the business done on this earth,
\q1 because day and night there’s someone not sleeping,
\q1
\v 17 and I saw everything that God does—
\q1 realising that humanity can’t discover everything that’s done \add in this world\add*—
\q1 they’ll try to discover it but fail.
\q1 Even if a wise person claimed to know,
\q1 they wouldn’t be able to discover it.
\c 9
\p
\v 1 \add Indeed I set my mind\add* to examine all this
\q1 and concluded that godly and wise people and their work is in God’s hands.
\q1 Being loved or being hated, humankind doesn’t know what’s ahead of them.
\q1
\v 2 We all have the same fate whether godly or wicked,
\q1 or good or pure or impure,
\q1 whether you sacrifice or not,
\q1 or you’re good or disobedient,
\q1 or you make a promise or you’re \add the subject of\add* a promise.
\q1
\v 3 There’s evil in everything that’s done \add in this world\add*:
\q1 that same \add final event\add* for everyone.
\q1 Yes, humankind’s minds are full of evil and madness during their lifetimes,
\q1 and after that \add they join\add* the dead.
\q1
\v 4 \add Anyone\add* who’s joined to the living has hope,
\q1 because a dog that’s alive is better than a lion that’s dead,
\q1
\v 5 because the living know that we’ll die
\q1 \add but\add* the dead don’t know anything
\q1 and have no further reward because their memory is forgotten.
\q1
\v 6 Their love and hatred and their envy will have already perished,
\q1 and they no longer have a part in everything that’s done \add in this world\add*.
\q1
\v 7 \add So\add* go and enjoy eating your food and drinking your wine
\q1 because God has already approved \add what you’ve been doing\add*.
\q1
\v 8 Always let your clothes be \add clean and\add* white,
\q1 and don’t \add spare the use of lotion\add* on your head.
\q1
\v 9 Live together with the wife that you love
\q1 for all the length of your pointless life that you’re given \add in this world\add*,
\q1 because that’s your allocation in your life
\q1 and in the work that you’re doing \add in this world\add*.
\q1
\v 10 Everything that you find to do, do it \add well\add*,
\q1 because in \add the grave\add* where you’ll be going,
\q1 there’s no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom.
\b
\q1
\v 11 I again saw \add in this world\add*
\q1 that the fastest \add ones\add* don’t \add always\add* win the race,
\q1 the most powerful \add side\add* doesn’t \add always\add* win the war,
\q1 wise \add people\add* don’t \add always\add* have enough to eat,
\q1 intelligent \add people\add* don’t \add always\add* get wealthy,
\q1 and people with understanding don’t \add always\add* win favour,
\q1 because chance and timing affects them all.
\q1
\v 12 \add You see,\add* humanity doesn’t know \add when their time is about to be up\add*:
\q1 \add just\add* like a fish getting caught in a deadly net,
\q1 or birds that get caught in a trap,
\q1 \add so too\add* people can get caught out when trouble suddenly hits them.
\s1 Wisdom is better than stupidity
\p
\v 13 I also saw this \add about\add* wisdom \add in this world\add*
\q1 and found it powerful:
\v 14 There was a small \add walled\add* city with \add not so many inhabitants\add* and a powerful king \add decided to\add* attack it \add so he\add* surrounded it and built large siege ramps against \add the walls\add*.
\v 15 There was a poor man in \add the city\add* who was wise and used his wisdom to save it \add from that king\add*, \add but the people soon forgot about\add* that poor man.
\v 16 \add So I concluded\add* that wisdom is better than strength and yet the poor person’s wisdom \add wasn’t appreciated and his words were soon forgotten\add*.
\q1
\v 17 The words of wise people are quietly heeded—
\q1 more than those of a ruler shouting at a \add bunch of\add* fools.
\q1
\v 18 It’s better to be wise than to have many weapons,
\q1 \add but\add* one disobedient person will destroy a lot of good.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Dead flies make a perfumer’s \add product\add* stink.
\q1 \add Similarly\add*, a little foolishness can ruin \add all your\add* wisdom or honour.
\q1
\v 2 A wise person’s \add thoughts\add* lead to \add protection\add*,
\q1 ^\add but\add* a fool’s \add thoughts\add* lead to \add vulnerability\add*
\q1
\v 3 and while they’re walking along the road,
\q1 \add the fool\add* lacks \add common\add* sense
\q1 and everyone \add is aware of what a fool they are\add*.
\q1
\v 4 If a ruler \add gets upset with\add* you, don’t quit your position,
\q1 because calmness will \add smooth over large offenses\add*.
\q1
\v 5 I saw \add another\add* \add misfortune in this world\add*:
\q1 where an error happened in front of a ruler.
\q1
\v 6 Foolishness can happen even in high positions,
\q1 ^and wealthy people can be in low positions.
\q1
\v 7 I’ve seen slaves riding horses
\q1 ^and princes walking on the ground like slaves.
\q1
\v 8 A person who digs a pit can fall into it,\x + \xo 10:8: \xt Psa 7:15; Prv 26:27.\x*
\q1 and \add an attacker who\add* breaks through a wall gets bitten by a snake.
\q1
\v 9 A person who pulls out rocks might be hurt by them.
\q1 Someone who splits wood might get injured by it.
\q1
\v 10 If your iron axehead gets blunt and \add the owner\add* doesn’t sharpen it,
\q1 then he has to use lots of strength,
\q1 \add so use wisdom if you want to succeed\add*.
\q1
\v 11 If a snake bites before it’s charmed,
\q1 the snake charmer \add won’t be able to charge\add* \add for the show\add*.
\q1
\v 12 A wise person’s words earn them favour,
\q1 but a fool’s lips destroy him—
\q1
\v 13 \add as soon as he opens his mouth, foolishness comes out\add*,
\q1 and the end of his chatter is wicked madness.
\q1
\v 14 Then the fool \add continues again with more nonsense\add*.
\b
\q1 No one knows what will happen \add next\add*.
\q1 Who can tell \add you\add* what \add will happen in the future\add*?
\q1
\v 15 A foolish person’s work wears him out,
\q1 because he doesn’t know how to get to a city.
\q1
\v 16 \add A country won’t end well\add*
\q1 if its king is young and its princes feast in the morning.
\q1
\v 17 \add A country is blessed if its king comes from a noble family\add*
\q1 and its princes eat \add and drink\add* for strength and not for drunkenness.
\q1
\v 18 With \add a lazy owner\add*, the roof beams will sag.
\q1 Idle hands \add will result in a leaky house\add*.
\q1
\v 19 \add There’s laughter around the meal table\add*,
\q1 wine makes people glad,
\q1 and money is the answer to everything.
\q1
\v 20 Don’t curse the king even in your mind,
\q1 and don’t curse the rich even in your bedroom,
\q1 because a \add little birdie\add* will carry \add your words\add*
\q1 and some \add feathered critter\add* will pass on \add what you said\add*.
\c 11
\s1 The to do of wise
\p
\v 1 Throw your bread \add out\add* onto the waters
\q1 because you’ll find it \add again\add* in several days.
\q1
\v 2 \add Share it around\add* seven or eight \add others\add*
\q1 because you don’t know when a calamity will hit \add your area\add*.
\q1
\v 3 If the clouds are filled with rain, they’ll pour it out,
\q1 and if a tree falls to the north or the south,
\q1 wherever it falls, that’s where it’ll be.
\q1
\v 4 A person who \add worries about\add* the wind,
\q2 won’t sow \add any seed\add*,
\q1 and someone who \add keeps\add* looking at the clouds,
\q2 will never harvest \add their crop\add*.
\q1
\v 5 Just as you don’t know \add how the winds work\add*,
\q1 \add or how\add* the bones get into a pregnant woman’s womb,
\q1 nor do you know how God does everything that he does.
\q1
\v 6 Sow your seed in the morning
\q2 and don’t stop planting until the evening,
\q1 because you don’t know which \add areas\add* will grow well,
\q1 or whether it will all \add succeed\add* equally.
\b
\q1
\v 7 Light is sweet
\q2 and it’s good for \add your\add* eyes to see the sun.
\q1
\v 8 Even if a person lives for many years,
\q1 they should take pleasure in all of them,
\q1 \add but\add* remember the dark days
\q1 because everything that happens is pointless.
\s1 Advice to young people
\p
\v 9 Young people, enjoy \add being young and strong\add*
\q1 and stay cheerful during \add that youthful stage\add*.
\q1 Follow your \add ambitions\add* and your \add desires\add*
\q1 \add but\add* be aware that God will judge you concerning all those things.
\b
\q1
\v 10 \add Don’t allow yourself to be controlled by\add* anger
\q1 and keep your body away from evil,
\q1 because youth and \add good looks\add* are a vapour \add that passes\add*.
\c 12
\p
\v 1 \add Think about\add* your creator \add while you’re still young\add*,
\q1 before \add troubling times\add* come
\q1 and the years arrive when you’ll say that you no longer \add find\add* pleasure in them.
\q1
\v 2 \add Yes,\add* before the sun and the light, and the moon and the stars \add seem\add* darker,
\q1 and the clouds return after the rain.
\q1
\v 3 That day when the guards of the house will get the trembles
\q1 and the strong men will be bent over,
\q1 and the \add women\add* grinding \add grain\add* will stop because there’s only a few of them \add left\add*,
\q1 and the \add women\add* looking out the windows will no longer see clearly.\f + \fr 12:3 \ft This may also be referring to the failing body, e.g., the guards being the arms, the stooping being the legs, the grinders being few would refer to the teeth, and the windows might refer to the eyes.\f*
\q1
\v 4 Then the doors in the street will be shut
\q1 so that the grinding that \add gets louder\add* with the first birdsong will be \add barely heard\add*
\q1 and all the girls singing will be \add quietened\add*.
\q1
\v 5 The people will also become afraid of heights
\q1 and the road will have its terrors.
\q1 The almond trees will blossom
\q1 and the locusts will drag themselves along.
\q1 Normal desires will be lost
\q1 because you’ll be heading for your eternal home
\q1 and the mourners will be in the streets.
\q1
\v 6 \add Think about God\add* before the silver cord gets broken
\q1 and the golden bowl breaks,
\q1 the pitcher shatters at the well
\q1 and the wheel is crushed at the cistern,
\q1
\v 7 the dust returns to the earth as it was
\q1 and the spirit returns to God who gave it.
\q1
\v 8 “\add Nothing but a puff of air\add*,” says the leader. “Everything is pointless.”
\s1 Conclusion
\p
\v 9 Besides the fact that the leader was wise, he still taught the people knowledge, and he searched and evaluated. He \add arranged and edited\add* many proverbs.
\v 10 The leader searched for pleasing words, and wrote down many truthful words \add that would lead to\add* godliness.
\q1
\v 11 The words of wise people \add can prod\add* \add others along\add*,
\q1 and they’re like nails holding things firm.
\q1 They’re \add all\add* given by one shepherd.
\q1
\v 12 My son, be careful of anything in addition to these,
\q1 because there’s no end to producing books
\q1 and \add too much study wears you out\add*.
\q1
\v 13 \add So after listening to everything, here’s the final conclusion\add*:
\q1 \add Respect God and strive to follow him\add* and obey his commands,
\q1 because that’s humanity’s whole \add duty\add*.
\q1
\v 14 \add Yes,\add* God will \add judge everything we do\add*
\q1 \add including everything that’s been\add* hidden
\q1 whether good or bad.
