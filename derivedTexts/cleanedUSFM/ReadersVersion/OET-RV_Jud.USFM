\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This letter was written by Yudas the younger brother of Yacob. (Note that he wasn’t the Yudas who handed Yeshua over to the Jewish religious leaders. Note also that Yudas is mistakenly called Yude in most English Bibles, and Yacob is quite wrongly called James in most English Bibles.)
\is2 This letter
\ip We don’t know which group of believers that this letter was sent to. Here in this letter, Yudas warns the believers about teachers of false doctrines who teach that it’s okay for believers to continue sinning since they’ll just be forgiven due to God’s mercy. That’s the reason Yudas wrote this, to warn the believers so that they won’t fall for false beliefs, but instead will continue to follow the true teaching that came from God. He also encourages the readers that it’s necessary to strive to continue in their faith in God along with turning away from evil actions.

\v 1 \x + \xo 1: \xt Mat 13:55; Mrk 6:3.\x*\add This letter is from\add* Yudas, a slave of Yeshua the messiah, and brother of Yacob. It’s written to all those who have been called and loved by \nd God\nd* the father and who have kept \add believing\add* in Yeshua the messiah.
\p
\v 2 \add I pray\add* that you all will experience \add God’s\add* mercy and peace, and a bountiful supply of love.
\s1 The judgement of false-teachers and god-rejecters
\p
\v 3 Friends, I was so enthusiastic to write to you concerning our salvation that we have in common, but I needed to write to you all, encouraging you to stand strong for the teaching that was entrusted to the believers at a certain point in time.
\v 4 Because some people have quietly come into \add our groups\add* who think they can take advantage of God’s grace to bring in immoral lifestyles and disowning the only master, and our boss who’s \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah\nd*. But they are destined for judgement.
\p
\v 5 \x + \xo 5: a \xt Exo 12:51; \xo b \xt Num 14:29-30.\x*Now I want to remind you that although you all know how \nd Yeshua\nd* rescued our people out of Egypt, yet \add at the same time\add* he destroyed the ones who didn’t believe.
\v 6 Even the messengers who broke their own rules and left their own domain have been held in eternal chains in the darkness until the time of judgement in the great day.
\v 7 \x + \xo 7: \xt Gen 19:1-24.\x*Similarly Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns around them stay in our minds as an example of the judgement of eternal fire due to similar sexual perversions.
\p
\v 8 in the same way these dreamers defile their own bodies while rejecting authority and dishonouring those who should be honoured.
\v 9 \x + \xo 9: a \xt Dan 10:13,21; 12:1; Rev 12:7; \xo b \xt Deu 34:6; \xo c \xt Zech 3:2.\x*Even Michael, \add one of\add* the top messengers, when he was arguing with the devil about Mosheh’s body, he didn’t belittle him, but left it to \nd Yahweh\nd* to punish him.
\v 10 But these people mock what they don’t even grasp, but they’ll be destroyed by what their animal instincts do understand.
\v 11 Oh dear! Because they’ve followed the actions of Cain\x + \xo 11: \xt Gen 4:3-8; 1Yhn 3:12.\x* and have embraced the deception of Balaam\x + \xo 11: \xt Num 22–24; 31:16; 2Pe 2:15-16.\x* for monetary gain, so too they’ll perish like Korah’s destruction.\x + \xo 11: \xt Num 16:1-35.\x*
\v 12 These are the people who ruin your love feasts when they eat without shame and only look after themselves. They’re like clouds that are blown away by the wind without bringing the needed rain or trees that don’t produce any fruit then are doubly useless by falling over;
\v 13 like wild waves in the ocean that foam in their own shame or like \add unreliable \add* wandering stars that are already doomed to the darkest darkness in the next age.
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 14: \xt Gen 5:18,21-24.\x*Enoch (the seventh generation from Adam) prophesied \add way back then\add* about these people, “Look, \nd Yahweh\nd*, surrounded by tens of thousands of his holy \add messengers\add*, came
\v 15 to sentence everybody and to punish everyone who rejected God for everything they did that demonstrated this rejection and everything they said against him.”
\v 16 This includes their grumbling and complaining, the fulfilling of their own lustful desires, the arrogant way that they spoke, and their flattering of others in order to gain from them.
\s1 Keep your faith and keep ministering to others
\p
\v 17 \nd But\nd* you, friends, always be thinking about how the missionaries of our \nd master Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah\nd*
\v 18 \x + \xo 18: \xt 2Pe 3:3.\x*told you that mockers near the end of time would come out following their own god-rejecting lusts.
\v 19 These people will cause division as they just demonstrate sensuality since they don’t know \add God’s\add* \nd spirit\nd*.
\v 20 But you, friends, work to increase your faith in God, praying as the holy \nd spirit\nd* helps you.
\v 21 Keep receiving God’s love as you look forward to living forever thanks to the mercy of our \nd master\nd*, \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah\nd*.
\p
\v 22 Show grace to those \add still\add* doubting
\v 23 whereas others need to be ‘snatched out of the fire’ in order to be saved. To some, show mercy but very carefully, hating even their clothes which reflect their crude lifestyles.
\s1 Honouring God
\p
\v 24-25 Our master, Yeshua the messiah, is the infallible one who is quite capable of looking after all of us so that we can stand blameless in front of him and praise him in his full honour and greatness. Let us honour and praise our only God and saviour, acknowledging his greatness and power and authority through Yeshua from before the creation, right through these current times, and in the age to come. May it be so.
