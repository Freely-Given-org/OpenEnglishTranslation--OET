\mt2 The account of Yeshua’s ministry by
\mt1 Mark
\is1 Introduction
\is2 Author
\ip This account about the works and teachings of Yeshua was written by Mark, the son of a Jewish family who lived in Yerushalem. His mother was named Maria (Acts 12:12).
\ip Many people think he was Yohan Mark, a cousin of Barnabas (Col. 4:10) who accompanied Paul on his first long-distance trip to spread the good message about Yeshua the messiah (Acts 12:25, 13:13). We also know that Mark accompanied Peter (1 Peter 5:13), and some consider that it might have been Peter who narrated to Mark what Yeshua had done and taught.
\is2 This account
\ip This account seems to have been written for non-Jews, especially perhaps those familiar with Roman customs. So he didn’t use as much ink as Matthew or Luke explaining prophecies from the Jewish scriptures but he does however, take time to explain Jewish customs to help non-Jewish readers.
\ip Mark explains here that Yeshua came to serve both God and the people, and he often refers to him as ‘humanity’s child’ (traditionally translated very literally from the Greek as the ‘Son of Man’). We can see that especially in 10:45: “Even humanity’s child didn’t come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom to set many people free.” Mark wants his readers to know that Yeshua did incredible things, but especially focuses on his teaching. He confirms the power and authority of Yeshua by telling about the miracles that he did, his healing of the sick, and his exorcism of demons.
\ip The ending of this account is often disputed, and scholars are still \jmp debating|link-href="https://textandcanon.org/a-case-for-the-longer-ending-of-mark"\jmp* about whether or not the longer ending (16:9-20) is original. The \em OET\em* includes the disputed longer ending, but displays it in a lighter colour to indicate its debatable status.

\v 1 Here begins the good message about \nd Yeshua\nd* the \nd messiah\nd*—the son of \nd God\nd*:
\s1 The ministry of Yohan the immerser (The return of ‘Eliyyah’)
\r (Mat. 3:1-12; Luke 3:1-18; Yhn. 1:19-28)
\p
\v 2 The prophet Isayah wrote:\x + \xo 1:2: \xt Mal 3:1.\x*
\q1 “See, I am sending my messenger to you,
\q1 the one who will be preparing your path.
\q1
\v 3 \x + \xo 1:3: \xt Isa 40:3 (LXX).\x*The voice \add out\add* in the wilderness shouting,
\q2 ‘Get the path ready for \nd Yahweh\nd*;
\q2 Make it smooth for him to travel on.’ ”
\p
\v 4 Yohan turned up in the wilderness announcing that people should get immersed in water in order to show that their sins have been forgiven.
\v 5 And many from the Yudean region and from the city of Yerushalem went out to hear him, and they confessed their sins and asked Yohan to immerse them in the Yordan river.
\p
\v 6 \x + \xo 1:6: \xt 2Ki 1:8.\x*Yohan was dressed in simple clothes made from camel hair with a leather belt around his waist, and he lived on locusts and wild honey.
\v 7 And he also announced, “There’s a greater man coming soon—in fact I’m not even good enough to bend down and untie his sandals.
\v 8 I immersed you in water, but he will immerse you all in God’s holy \nd spirit\nd*.”
\s1 Yeshua gets immersed and then tempted
\r (Mat. 3:13–4:11; Luke 3:21-22; 4:1-13)
\p
\v 9 \fig Yeshua was immersed by Yohan.|src="41_Mk_01_06_RG.jpg" size="col" loc="1:9" copy="© Sweet Publishing" ref="1:9"\fig*Then one day Yeshua came from \nd Nazareth\nd* in the Galilee region, and he got immersed in the Yordan river by Yohan.
\v 10 As Yeshua came up out of the water, he saw the sky being opened up, and God’s \nd spirit\nd* coming down on him like a dove.
\v 11 \x + \xo 1:11: \xt Gen 22:2; Psa 2:7; Isa 42:1; Mat 3:17; 12:18; Mrk 9:7; Luk 3:22.\x*And a voice came from the sky saying, “You are my son who I love and am pleased with.”
\p
\v 12 And then the \nd spirit\nd* sent him into the wilderness
\v 13 where he was tested by Satan for forty days. He was out there with the wild animals, but messengers waited on him there.
\s1 The selection of the first followers/apprentices
\r (Mat. 4:12-22; Luke 4:14-15; 5:1-11)
\p
\v 14 After Yohan had been arrested, \nd Yeshua\nd* went back up to Galilee announcing the good news from \nd God\nd*
\v 15 \x + \xo 1:15: \xt Mat 3:2.\x*saying, “\wj The promised time is here, and God’s kingdom is now near. Turn from your sins and believe this good news.\wj*”
\p
\v 16 As he went around the lake of Galilee, Yeshua saw two fishermen, Simon and his brother Andrew throwing a net into the lake.
\v 17 And he said to them, “\wj Come with me and I will make you into fishermen of people.\wj*”
\v 18 And so they left their fishing work and went off with Yeshua.
\p
\v 19 Then a bit further on he saw two of Zebedee’s sons, Yacob and his brother Yohan, in a boat getting their nets ready.
\v 20 Yeshua called them and they too went off with him, leaving their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers.
\s1 Yeshua drives out a demon
\r (Luke 4:31-37)
\p
\v 21 They went on into Capernaum where he went into the meeting hall and began teaching as soon as the rest day started.
\v 22 \x + \xo 1:22: \xt Mat 7:28-29.\x*The congregation was amazed at his teaching, because he taught with authority, not like the regular teachers there.
\p
\v 23 Then a demon-possessed man in the meeting hall suddenly yelled out,
\v 24 “What are we to you, \nd Yeshua\nd* of \nd Nazareth\nd*? You’ve come to destroy us. I know that you’re God’s holy one.”
\p
\v 25 But \nd Yeshua\nd* scolded it, saying, “\wj Keep quiet!\wj*”, and, “\wj Come out of him!\wj*”
\p
\v 26 Then the demon threw the man into a convulsion, cried out loudly, and left him.
\v 27 Everyone was astounded and asked each other, “What just happened? We haven’t heard anything like this before—he has authority to command demons, and they obey him!”
\p
\v 28 And the news about Yeshua spread all over the entire region of Galilee.
\s1 Yeshua heals many others
\r (Mat. 8:14-17; Luke 4:38-41)
\p
\v 29 After leaving the meeting hall, Yeshua went into the home of Simon and Andrew, along with Yacob and Yohan.
\v 30 Inside, Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down with a fever, and the others spoke to Yeshua about her.
\v 31 When he went up to her, and took hold of her hand and helped her up, the fever left her and she prepared something for them to eat.
\p
\v 32 That evening when the sun set, the people brought all those who were sick or demon-possessed to Yeshua.
\v 33 It seemed like the entire town had gathered there outside the front door.
\v 34 Yeshua healed many who were sick from a range of diseases, and he commanded many demons to leave—not allowing them to speak because they knew that he was the \nd messiah\nd*.
\s1 Yeshua prays before going preaching
\r (Luke 4:42-44)
\p
\v 35 In the small hours of the morning, Yeshua got up and went out to a quiet place and prayed there.
\v 36 But Simon and the others came looking for him,
\v 37 and when they found him they said, “Everyone’s looking for you!”
\p
\v 38 And Yeshua answered, “\wj Well, we’ll be going into the other villages around here, so that I can also tell them. That’s what I came here for.\wj*”
\v 39 \x + \xo 1:39: \xt Mat 4:23; 9:35.\x*Then he went preaching in all their meeting halls in Galilee and driving out demons.
\s1 Yeshua heals a man with leprosy
\r (Mat. 8:1-4; Luke 5:12-16)
\p
\v 40 A man with leprosy came to Yeshua asking him, “I know that you could heal me if you wanted to.”
\p
\v 41 Yeshua felt compassion for him, reached out his hand and touched him, and said, “\wj Yes, I will. Get well.\wj*”
\v 42 Then immediately the leprosy disappeared and he was well again.
\v 43 So Yeshua sent him away, but warned him:
\v 44 \x + \xo 1:44: \xt Lev 14:1-32.\x*“\wj Don’t talk to anyone—just go to the priest and show him that you’re well, and as a testimony of that, make the offering that Mosheh commanded.\wj*”
\p
\v 45 But after the man left, he started telling lots of people and spreading the news—so much so that Yeshua could no longer come into the town but had to stay out in quieter places, and people kept coming to him.
\c 2
\s1 Yeshua heals a paralysed man
\r (Mat. 9:1-8; Luke 5:17-26)
\p
\v 1 When Yeshua came back to Capernaum after a few days, people soon heard that he was back in the house.
\v 2 And so many people turned up there that there wasn’t any room left—not even in the doorway. Inside, Yeshua was explaining the Scriptures to them.
\v 3 Four men arrived, carrying a paralysed man to Yeshua,
\v 4 but because of the crowd, they were unable to get close. So they climbed up onto the flat roof, made a hole through it, and lowered the paralysed man lying on a pallet.
\v 5 Yeshua, observing their faith, said to the man, “\wj Son, your sins are forgiven!\wj*”\f + \fr 2:5 \ft Yeshua’s hearers would have taken this as a claim to be God, as they knew that only God could forgive sins.\f*
\p
\v 6 But some of the religious teachers were sitting there, thinking to themselves,
\v 7 “Why’s he talking like that? He’s seriously insulting God. There’s only one who can forgive sins, and that’s God himself.”
\p
\v 8 Then \nd Yeshua\nd*, knowing in his spirit that they are thinking like that, said to them, “\wj Why are you thinking that to yourselves?\wj*
\v 9 \wj Which is easier: to tell the paralysed man that his sins have been forgiven, or to tell him to pick up his bedding and walk?\wj*
\v 10 \wj But so you all can see that humanity’s child \+em does\+em* have authority here on the earth to forgive sins,\wj*” he turned and said to the paralysed man,
\v 11 “\wj Listen. Get up, take your bedding, and go home!\wj*”
\p
\v 12 So the man stood up, and picked up his bedding, and went out of the house where everyone saw him and marvelled and praised \nd God\nd* saying, “We’ve never seen anything like that happen before!”
\s1 The calling of Levi (Matthew)
\r (Mat. 9:9-13; Luke 5:27-32)
\p
\v 13 Yeshua went out beside the lake where crowds of people kept coming to him and he taught them.
\v 14 And as he was passing by the tax office, he saw Levi Alfaeus sitting there and said to him, “Come along with me.” So Levi stood up and followed Yeshua.
\p
\v 15 Yeshua ended up having a meal at Levi’s place, and many other tax collectors and undesirables were sitting there also, along with \nd Yeshua’s\nd* followers, because by then, many \add people\add* were following him around.
\v 16 \add When\add* the teachers from the Pharisee party noticed that Yeshua was eating beside undesirables and tax-collectors, they asked his followers, “How come he eats with tax-collectors and other low-life?”
\p
\v 17 \nd Yeshua\nd* overheard them and said, “\wj Healthy people don’t need a doctor—it’s the sick ones that do. I didn’t come here to help those who think they have no needs, but \add I came\add* to call sinners.\wj*”
\s1 The question of fasting
\r (Mat. 9:14-17; Luke 5:33-39)
\p
\v 18 Now the followers of Yohan-the-immerser and members of the Pharisees regularly fasted. So a small group came to Yeshua and asked, “How come Yohan’s followers and the Pharisee party fast regularly, yet your followers don’t?”
\p
\v 19 And \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj Can the friends of the groom fast when they’re celebrating along with him? No, as long as he’s still there, they won’t be fasting.\wj*
\v 20 \wj But in the future, the groom will be taken away from them, and \+em then\+em* they’ll be fasting.\wj*
\p
\v 21 “\wj No one sews a patch of new, unshrunken cloth onto an old garment, because the new patch will tear away from that old fabric and it will end up as a worse tear.\wj*
\v 22 \wj And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, because the wine will burst the \+add already stretched\+add* wineskins, and then both the wine and the wineskins will be destroyed. New wine must be put into \+em new\+em* wineskins.\wj*”
\s1 Working on the Rest Day
\r (Mat. 12:1-8; Luke 6:1-5)
\p
\v 23 \x + \xo 2:23: \xt Deu 23:25.\x*And it so happened that Yeshua and his followers passed through some fields of grain on some days of rest. As they went through, they plucked off some heads of grain.
\v 24 And some members of the Pharisee party said, “It’s breaking the law to harvest grain on a rest day!”
\p
\v 25 And Yeshua replied, “\wj You’ve read yourselves what David did when him and his men were hungry.\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 2:26: \xt Lev 24:9.\x*\wj They went into God’s tent and ate the holy bread representing the presence of God. Only the priests were allowed to eat that, and yet David even gave some to his men!\wj*”
\v 27 And he told the Pharisees, “\wj The days of rest were created for people, not people for the rest days.\wj*
\v 28 \wj So I, humanity’s child, have authority also over the day of rest.\wj*”
\c 3
\s1 The man with the curled-up hand
\r (Mat. 12:9-14; Luke 6:6-11)
\p
\v 1 And again another time, Yeshua went to the meeting hall and there was a man there with a curled-up hand.
\v 2 The religious leaders there were watching him closely to see if he would heal the man on the rest day, and then if he did, they would have a case against him.
\v 3 Then Yeshua said to the man with the flawed hand, “\wj Stand up there in the middle.\wj*”
\v 4 And he asked the leaders, “\wj Is it allowable to do good on the rest day, or only to do evil? To save life, or to kill?\wj*” But they didn’t reply.
\p
\v 5 After angrily looking around at them, grieving at their complete lack of compassion, he said to the man, “\wj Open up your hand!\wj*”
\v 6 The man stretched out his fingers, and his hand became totally normal. But the Pharisees quickly left, and meeting with King Herod’s supporters, they conspired to kill Yeshua.
\s1 Big crowds press on Yeshua
\p
\v 7 After that, \nd Yeshua\nd* withdrew towards the lake with his followers, and a huge crowd of people from the regions of both Galilee and down in Yudea,
\v 8 along with others from Yerushalem, Idumea, from across the Yordan River, and from up near Tyre and Tsidon. They came because they had heard about the amazing things he had done.
\v 9 \x + \xo 3:9-10: \xt Mrk 4:1; Luk 5:1-3.\x*So Yeshua asked his apprentices to organise a small boat to be there for him so he wouldn’t be cramped by the press of the crowd.
\v 10 Virtually anyone who had any physical issues was pressing towards him to touch him, because he had already healed so many.
\v 11 And the demons, whenever they saw Yeshua, they fell down to the ground in front of him and yelled out, “You are God’s son!”
\v 12 But he regularly warned them not to reveal who he was.
\s1 Yeshua appoints his twelve representatives
\r (Mat. 10:1-4; Luke 6:12-16)
\p
\v 13 As Yeshua started climbing up a hill, he called the followers that he had selected, and they went off with him.
\v 14 He appointed twelve of them as his representatives so that they could stick with him and be sent off to be proclaiming his message
\v 15 and to also have authority to exorcise demons.
\p
\v 16 These are the twelve that he appointed: Simon (but he appended the name “Peter”),
\v 17 Yacob and his brother Yohan who were Zebedee’s sons (and he nicknamed them the “sons of thunder”),
\v 18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, Yacob Alfaeus, Thaddeus, Simon from Canaan,
\v 19 and Yudas Iscariot who later betrayed him.
\s1 The two opposing spiritual powers
\r (Mat. 12:22-32; Luke 11:14-23; 12:10)
\p
\v 20 Then Yeshua was approaching a house, but the crowd swarmed them again so they had no opportunity to eat.
\v 21 The ones with him heard all the noise and came to get him, because they were wondering if he was crazy.
\p
\v 22 \x + \xo 3:22: \xt Mat 9:34; 10:25.\x*The religious teachers had come up from Yerushalem and were complaining, “He’s possessed by the prince of demons. He can command them because he rules them!”
\p
\v 23 But Yeshua addressed them: “\wj How could Satan command himself?\wj*
\v 24 \wj If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom could never prosper.\wj*
\v 25 \wj If a household is divided against itself, that family will never prosper.\wj*
\v 26 \wj So if Satan attacked himself and was split, he couldn’t possibly be powerful, but his time would be over.\wj*
\p
\v 27 \wj On the contrary, no one can enter a strong man’s house to clean out his possessions unless he first ties up that strong man—after that he can work on the goods.\wj*
\p
\v 28 \wj Honestly, I assure you that any sin of a person can be forgiven, no matter how much they curse God.\wj*
\v 29 \x + \xo 3:29: \xt Luk 12:10.\x*\wj But anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven, but is eternally responsible for their sin.\wj*”
\v 30 (He said this because they were saying that he was demon-possessed.)
\s1 Yeshua’s mother and brothers arrive
\r (Mat. 12:46-50; Luke 8:19-21)
\p
\v 31 Now Yeshua’s mother and brothers came and were standing outside and asked someone to tell him that they were there.
\v 32 Some in the crowd sitting around him told Yeshua that his mother and brothers were waiting outside for him.
\p
\v 33 But Yeshua answered, “\wj Who is my mother and who are my brothers?\wj*”
\v 34 And having looked around at the people sitting here, he said, “\wj Actually, you all are my mother and my brothers.\wj*
\v 35 \wj Anyone who obeys \+nd God\+nd*, that person is my brother and my sister and my mother.\wj*”
\c 4
\s1 The parable about planting seed
\r (Mat. 13:1-9; Luke 8:4-8)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 4:1: \xt Luk 5:1-3.\x*Again Yeshua started teaching by the edge of the lake. A huge crowd gathered around him, but he had boarded a boat that was floating in the water, and all the people were there on the land.
\v 2 \add From there\add*, he taught them many different things in parables, including this one:
\v 3 “\wj Listen. Once there was a farmer who went to spread some seed.\wj*
\v 4 \wj As he spread it, some landed on the path, and the birds came and fed on it.\wj*
\v 5 \wj Some landed on a rocky part without a lot of soil, and it quickly sprouted in the warm, shallow soil,\wj*
\v 6 \wj but when the sun came up, it dried out because the roots weren’t deep, and so it just withered up.\wj*
\v 7 \wj Some of the seed landed in a thistle patch, and the thistles grew and choked it out, so the plants never bore a crop.\wj*
\v 8 \wj But some seed landed in fertile soil and it bore a harvest—some of it multiplying thirty times, some sixty, and some a hundred times.\wj*”
\p
\v 9 Then Yeshua added, “\wj Anyone who wants to understand, let them consider it.\wj*”
\s1 Why Yeshua speaks in parables
\r (Mat. 13:10-17; Luke 8:9-10)
\p
\v 10 And when the crowd had left, the twelve apprentices asked him about the parables.
\v 11 And he told them, “\wj You’ve been given understanding about God’s kingdom, but for others, they’ll get it in parables\wj*
\q1
\v 12 \x + \xo 4:12: \xt Isa 6:9-10 (LXX).\x*\wj so that when they look they might see but not perceive,\wj*
\q1 \wj and when they listen, they might hear but not understand,\wj*
\q1 \wj otherwise they might turn \+add from their sins\+add* and be forgiven.\wj*”
\s1 Explaining about the ground where the seed fell
\r (Mat. 13:18-23; Luke 8:11-15)
\p
\v 13 Then Yeshua said to them, “\wj If you didn’t understand this parable, how will you understand any others?\wj*
\v 14 \wj The person spreading seed is spreading the good message,\wj*
\v 15 \wj and there are some along the path where the good message is being spread, who hear, but Satan turns up immediately and snatches the message from them.\wj*
\v 16 \wj Similarly, there’s some seed that falls onto rocky places where the people who hear the good message happily accept it,\wj*
\v 17 \wj but don’t make strong roots—just temporary \+add changes\+add*. So when they get mocked or attacked about accepting the good message, they quickly stumble.\wj*
\v 18 \wj Others are the ones where the seed was spread among the thistles. They heard the good message,\wj*
\v 19 \wj but contemporary topics, or the lure of money, or the appetite for other things, choke their good intentions and the message becomes unfruitful in them.\wj*
\v 20 \wj But lastly, the seed that landed on the good soil represents the people who hear the good message, accept it, and are fruitful thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times over.\wj*”
\s1 The light will shine on everything
\r (Luke 8:16-18)
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 4:21: \xt Mat 5:15; Luk 11:33.\x*And Yeshua told them, “\wj Obviously no one goes and gets a lamp, and then puts it under a basket or under the bed, but rather they place it somewhere higher on a stand.\wj*
\v 22 \x + \xo 4:22: \xt Mat 10:26; Luk 12:2.\x*\wj You see, nothing is hidden that won’t eventually be disclosed, and there’s no secret that won’t eventually be revealed.\wj*
\v 23 \wj Anyone who wants to understand must listen carefully.\wj*”
\p
\v 24 \x + \xo 4:24: \xt Mat 7:2; Luk 6:38.\x*And he continued, “\wj Take care what you listen to. Because how much you judge others, so too will judgement be handed out to you, and even more.\wj*
\v 25 \x + \xo 4:25: \xt Mat 13:12; 25:29; Luk 19:26.\x*\wj Anyone who has \+add faith\+add* will be given \+add a reward\+add*, but if you have none, even the little you have will be taken away.\wj*”
\s1 The parable concerning the seed
\p
\v 26 And then, “\wj God’s kingdom is like a person throwing some seed onto the ground.\wj*
\v 27 \wj Whether the person sleeps at night or stays up night and day, the seed will sprout and grow either way, and they don’t know how it does it.\wj*
\v 28 \wj The earth is \+add designed\+add* to multiply the seed: first a sprout appears, then a bigger plant, and then the full head of grain.\wj*
\v 29 \x + \xo 4:29: \xt Yoel 3:13.\x*\wj Then when it’s ripe, the harvester is sent in because it’s ready for harvest.\wj*”
\s1 The small seed produces a large result
\r (Mat. 13:31-32,34; Luke 13:18-19)
\p
\v 30 Again he said, “\wj What could we liken God’s kingdom to? Or what parable could we explain it with?\wj*
\v 31 \wj It’s like planting a mustard seed in the ground—a very small seed.\wj*
\v 32 \wj But when it’s planted and grows up, it forms a large bush with many branches so that birds can rest in its shade.\wj*”
\p
\v 33 And so as much as they could handle it, Yeshua shared the good message with them via many similar word pictures.
\v 34 He never spoke without these illustrations, but he explained all of them to his close followers.
\s1 Yeshua halts the storm on the lake
\r (Mat. 8:23-27; Luke 8:22-25)
\p
\v 35 It was already becoming evening on that day, so Yeshua said \add to his apprentices\add*, “\wj Let’s all go across to the other shore.\wj*”
\v 36 So they left the crowd behind and got into the boat with him.
\v 37 \add Out in the lake\add* a big storm came up with strong winds, and the waves started breaking across the boat and filling it.
\v 38 But Yeshua slept on in the back, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him and cried, “Teacher, don’t you care that we’re all about to drown?”
\p
\v 39 Now awake, Yeshua scolded the wind and waves, “\wj Quieten down! Stop that!\wj*” Then the wind died down and the water became very calm.
\v 40 And \add turning back to them\add* he asked, “\wj Why were you all so afraid? Don’t you have any faith yet?\wj*”
\p
\v 41 But now they were very afraid \add again\add* and asked each other, “Who could this man be that both the wind and waves obey him?”
\c 5
\s1 Yeshua sends the demons into the pigs
\r (Mat. 8:28-34; Luke 8:26-39)
\p
\v 1 So they got \add safely\add* to the region of Gerasenes on the other side of the lake.
\v 2 As Yeshua climbed out of the boat, a demon-possessed man came out of the tombs to meet him.
\v 3 He lived in those tombs, and no one could tie him up, not even with chains,
\v 4 because he had often been tied up in the past with shackles and chains but had always pulled the chains apart and smashed the shackles, and no one was able to subdue him.
\v 5 All through the day and night, whether in the tombs or up in the hills, he was yelling out and hurting himself with stones.
\p
\v 6 So when he had seen \nd Yeshua\nd* in the distance, he ran and \add as a sign of honour\add* fell to the ground in front of him.
\v 7 Then he called out very loudly, “What will happen between us, \nd Yeshua\nd*, the son of the highest God? I beg you in God’s name not to torment me.”
\v 8 Because Yeshua had already started saying, “\wj Come out of the man you ungodly spirit!\wj*”
\p
\v 9 Yeshua asked, “\wj What’s your name?\wj*”
\p The man answered, “My name is ‘Thousands’ because there’s many of us,”
\v 10 and he begged Yeshua not to send them out of the country.
\p
\v 11 It just so happened that there was a large herd of pigs being fed on the hill nearby
\v 12 and they begged Yeshua again saying, “Send us to the pigs so that we can enter them.”
\v 13 Yeshua agreed to that, so the ungodly spirits came out of the man, went into the pigs, and the entire herd of some two thousand pigs rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned.
\p
\v 14 The ones who had been feeding them rushed off and spread the news around in the city and the surrounding area. So the people hurried out to see what had happened.
\v 15 When they arrived where \nd Yeshua\nd* was, they saw the man who had been demon-possessed fully-clothed and sitting there in full control of his senses. They knew it was the man called ‘Thousands’ and they became frightened.
\v 16 Those who had seen it all happen described it all to the people—what had happened both to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs.
\p
\v 17 So then the people began asking Yeshua to go away from their region.
\p
\v 18 As Yeshua was climbing back into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed wanted to go with him.
\p
\v 19 But Yeshua wouldn’t let him and told him to head back home to his own people, and explain to them what the \nd Master\nd* had done for him and how he had been merciful to him.
\p
\v 20 So he went away and shared with the people of the Ten Cities region what \nd Yeshua\nd* had done for him, and they were all amazed.
\s1 A woman is healed as Yeshua goes to help a dying girl
\r (Mat. 9:18-26; Luke 8:40-56)
\p
\v 21 When \nd Yeshua\nd* had crossed in the boat to the other side of the lake, a large crowd of people came out to the lake edge to see him.
\v 22 A religious leader named Jairus came out, and when he found Yeshua he fell down at his feet
\v 23 and pleaded, “My young daughter is critical and just hanging on for you to come and touch her so that she can be healed and live.”
\p
\v 24 So Yeshua went off with Jairus. The large crowd followed also and many were getting pressed against Yeshua.
\p
\v 25 Then a woman came who had been losing blood for twelve years
\v 26 and who had endured much under various doctors despite spending everything she had. After all that, she’d ended up even worse,
\v 27 but when she heard about what Yeshua had been doing, she worked her way through the crowd to the back of Yeshua and touched his clothes,
\v 28 because she had told herself, “If I could even just touch his clothes, I would be healed.”
\p
\v 29 And immediately the bleeding stopped and she knew that she had been healed.
\v 30 Immediately also, \nd Yeshua\nd* knew that power had gone out of him, and he turned back towards the crowd and said, “\wj Who touched my clothes?\wj*”
\p
\v 31 But his followers said, “You can see all the people that were pressing on you so why would you ask who touched you?”
\p
\v 32 But Yeshua was still looking around to see who had done it.
\v 33 And the woman, scared and shaking because of what was happening, came and fell down in front of Yeshua and told him the whole story.
\v 34 Yeshua said, “\wj Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and full health.\wj*”
\p
\v 35 While he was still speaking, messengers came from Jairus’ house to tell him, “Your daughter has died. Why bother the teacher any more?”
\p
\v 36 But \nd Yeshua\nd* overheard them telling this to the leader and told him, “\wj Don’t be afraid—keep believing.\wj*”
\v 37 And Yeshua didn’t allow anyone to accompany him other than Peter, and Yacob and his brother, Yohan.
\v 38 As they approached Jairus’ house, Yeshua saw a big commotion with lots of crying and yelling going on.
\v 39 As he entered, he said, “\wj Why are you all crying in distress? The child hasn’t died—she’s just sleeping!\wj*”
\p
\v 40 But they just ridiculed Yeshua. So he sent them all outside, just taking the father and mother of the child, along with three with him. He went in where the girl was
\v 41 and taking her hand, he said, “\wj Young woman, I tell you: get up!\wj*”
\v 42 Immediately she got up and walked around. And everyone marvelled at the amazing thing that had happened. (She was twelve years old.)
\v 43 Yeshua repeatedly told them to keep this to themselves, and added that they should give her something to eat.
\c 6
\s1 Yeshua’s community can’t believe he’s from God
\r (Mat. 13:53-58; Luke 4:16-30)
\p
\v 1 So Yeshua left Capernaum and went back with his followers to \add Nazareth,\add* his birthplace.
\v 2 It was now the Rest Day and when he started teaching in the meeting hall, many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did he learn all this? How could he have such wisdom and be able to do these miracles?
\v 3 Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Maria, and the brother of Yacob and Yosef and Yudas and Simon? Don’t his sisters live around here?” And they were offended by his teaching.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 6:4: \xt Yhn 4:44.\x*\nd Yeshua\nd* told them, “\wj A prophet is only dishonoured in his own home town, and among his own relatives, and in his own home.\wj*”
\p
\v 5 And he wasn’t able to do even one miracle there, except for placing his hands on a few sick people and healing them.
\v 6 He was amazed at how they wouldn’t believe him as he went around the villages teaching.
\s1 Yeshua sends his apprentices out in pairs
\r (Mat. 10:5-15; Luke 9:1-6)
\p
\v 7 Then he called his twelve apprentices and started sending them out in pairs and giving them authority over demons.
\v 8 He insisted that they can carry a walking stick but not to take food, a backpack, or money.
\v 9 They could wear one pair of sandals, but not take changes of clothes.
\v 10 And he told them, “\wj Whenever you are invited into a home, stay at that one place until you leave that town.\wj*
\v 11 \x + \xo 6:11: \xt Acts 13:51.\x*\wj But if any places don’t want you or don’t want to hear what you have to say, just leave that place. As you go, shake the dust off your sandals so they can see \+add that you pass the responsibility of what happened to them\+add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 12 So the apprentices went off and started telling people to repent.
\v 13 \x + \xo 6:13: \xt Jam 5:14.\x*And they drove out many demons, and anointed many sick people with olive oil and healed them.
\s1 The execution of Yohan-the-immerser
\r (Mat. 14:1-12; Luke 9:7-9)
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 6:14-15: \xt Mat 16:14; Mrk 8:28; Luk 9:19.\x*Yeshua was now becoming well known and King Herod \add Antipas\add* heard about him. He thought that maybe Yohan-the-immerser had come back to life and that’s why he was able to do miracles.
\p
\v 15 But others thought it was \add the promised return of\add* Eliyyah, and yet others thought he must be another prophet like the ones \add in the Scriptures\add*.
\p
\v 16 But hearing about Yeshua, Herod was telling people, “That Yohan who I had beheaded, he must have come back to life!”
\v 17 \x + \xo 6:17-18: \xt Luk 3:19-20.\x*Because Herod himself had had Yohan arrested and put in prison because he had married Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife.
\v 18 Yohan had been telling him that it was wrong for him to marry his brother’s wife,
\v 19 and so Herodias resented him enough to want to kill him, but Herod hadn’t be able to
\v 20 because he respected Yohan as a righteous and holy teacher and so he kept him alive. He often enjoyed hearing from Yohan and thought a lot about what he said.
\p
\v 21 However, an opportunity came at Herod’s birthday celebration, when he threw a feast for his top officials and generals and for the leaders in Galilee.
\v 22 The daughter of Herodias came in and danced for them, and the king and his party guests all enjoyed it. So the king said to the young woman, “Just ask me for anything and I’ll give it to you.”
\v 23 And he made an oath, “Even if you asked for half of my kingdom, I’d give it to you!”
\p
\v 24 So she went out and asked her mother what she should ask for. Her mother told her that she should ask for Yohan’s head.
\p
\v 25 So going back into the party, she said seriously to the king, “I would like the head of Yohan-the-immerser on a plate!”
\p
\v 26 The king was really upset with that, but because he had made loud oaths in front of all his guests, he couldn’t say no.
\v 27 So he ordered an executioner to go out and return with Yohan’s head. He went off and beheaded him in the prison
\v 28 and brought the head into the party on a plate and gave it to the girl, and she gave it to her mother.
\v 29 When Yohan’s followers heard about this, they came and fetched his body and put it into a tomb.
\s1 Yeshua feeds 5,000 people
\r (Yhn 6:1-14; Mat. 14:13-21; Luke 9:10-17)
\p
\v 30 Now the apprentices who had been sent out returned back to \nd Yeshua\nd* and they reported back everything they had done and what they had been teaching \add people\add*.
\v 31 Then he told them, “\wj Let’s just all of us head for a quiet place and take a break.\wj*” This was because there were so many people always coming and going, and sometimes they didn’t even have a chance to eat.
\v 32 So they went by boat away to a quiet place by themselves.
\p
\v 33 But people from towns all around had seen them going and recognised who they were, so they ran around the lake on foot and got there ahead of them.
\v 34 \x + \xo 6:34: \xt Num 27:17; 1Ki 22:17; 2Ch 18:16; Eze 34:5; Mat 9:36.\x*So when Yeshua got out of the boat, he saw a big crowd and felt sorry for them because they seemed like sheep without a shepherd, so he started teaching them many things.
\v 35 Then, when it was already getting late, his apprentices came up and said, “This place is pretty isolated and it’s already late.
\v 36 Send these people off now so they can go to the nearby settlements and villages and buy themselves something to eat.”
\p
\v 37 But Yeshua answered them, “\wj You give them something to eat.\wj*”
\p They complained, “If we go, should we buy several months wages worth of bread so we can give all of them something to eat?”
\p
\v 38 But he asked, “\wj Go and find out how much bread you have.\wj*”
\p When they’d found out they said, “Five buns and two fish.”
\p
\v 39 Yeshua told all the people to line up in rows and sit down on the green grass.
\v 40 So they sat down in rows of fifty to a hundred.
\v 41 Then holding the five buns and two fish, he looking up to the sky and blessed \add God\add*, and then broke up the buns and gave pieces to his apprentices so they could do likewise to the people, and he also divided up the two fish,
\v 42 and all the people ate and were satisfied.
\v 43 Then they collected the leftover pieces of bread, filling twelve baskets, as well as the leftover pieces of fish.
\v 44 And the headcount of men who ate that evening was five thousand.
\s1 Yeshua walks on the lake surface
\r (Yhn 6:15-21; Mat. 14:22-33)
\p
\v 45 Straight after that, Yeshua sent his apprentices off in the boat to go across to Bethsaida while he sent the crowd home.
\v 46 Then he said goodbye to everyone, and climbed the hill to pray.
\v 47 Later in the night, the boat was out in the middle of the lake, and only Yeshua remained back there on the land.
\v 48 He saw them struggling to row against the wind, and sometime after 3am he came out to them, walking on the lake surface as if to walk past them.
\v 49 But they had seen someone walking on the lake and thought it was a ghost, and they yelled out
\v 50 because they had all seen it and were terrified.
\p But Yeshua immediately spoke to them and said, “\wj Hey, take heart, it’s me, don’t be afraid!\wj*”
\v 51 Then he climbed up into the boat and the wind died down. And they were all totally astounded
\v 52 because they hadn’t understood the implications of him feeding all the people because their minds were closed.
\s1 Yeshua heals many people around Gennesaret
\r (Mat. 14:34-36)
\p
\v 53 After completing their crossing, they anchored at Gennesaret.
\v 54 And when they got out of the boat, again people recognised Yeshua
\v 55 and ran around that region, so next minute people began bringing all of those who were sick, carrying them on pallets to wherever they heard that Yeshua was.
\v 56 And whenever Yeshua entered villages or cities or fields or marketplaces, they laid the sick down there and were imploring him that they might even just touch the edge of his robe, and anyone who did so was healed.
\c 7
\s1 Yeshua suggests obeying God, not tradition
\r (Mat. 15:1-9)
\p
\v 1 Some from the Pharisee party and some of the law teachers had come from Yerushalem to observe Yeshua
\v 2 and noticed that some of his followers were eating their food without following their religious customs, i.e., without washing their hands.
\v 3 (The Pharisees and, in fact, all the Jewish religious leaders do not eat without first ceremonially washing their hands as taught by their elders over the generations.
\v 4 They won’t eat at the market if they can’t do this first, and have many other regulations about ceremonial washing of cups and jugs and copper kettles.)
\p
\v 5 And the Pharisees and religious teachers asked Yeshua, “How come your followers don’t follow our Jewish traditions, but eat without the ceremonial washing of hands?”
\p
\v 6 And he answered, “\wj Isayah got it exactly right when he expressed God’s thoughts about you hypocrites and wrote:\wj*\x + \xo 7:6-7: \xt Isa 29:13 (LXX).\x*
\q1 \wj ‘These people honour me with their lips,\wj*
\q2 \wj but their real desires are far away from mine.\wj*
\q1
\v 7 \wj Their worship of me is worthless,\wj*
\q2 \wj teaching man-made rules as if they are from God.’\wj*
\p
\v 8 \wj You’ve ignored God’s commands instead accepting human traditions.\wj*”
\p
\v 9 And Yeshua continued, “\wj You all simply dismiss God’s commands in favour of your own customs.\wj*
\v 10 \x + \xo 7:10: a \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16; \xo b \xt Exo 21:17; Lev 20:9.\x*\wj Mosheh teaches us,\wj*
\q1 \wj ‘Honour your parents,’\wj*
\p \wj and\wj*
\q1 \wj ‘Anyone dishonestly slandering their parents deserves the death penalty.’\wj*
\m
\v 11 \wj But when you all encourage people to say, ‘Whatever I had that may have helped you guys has been given to God’,\wj*
\v 12 \wj you are actively discouraging them from helping their parents—\wj*
\v 13 \wj overriding God’s voice for your very convenient teaching that you disseminate instead. And that’s not the only example!\wj*”
\s1 Evil comes from inside a person
\r (Mat. 15:10-20)
\p
\v 14 Yeshua called out to the crowd, “\wj Everyone listen to me carefully:\wj*
\v 15 \wj Nothing that enters your mouth makes you guilty in God’s eyes. It’s what comes \+em out\+em* of you that demonstrates your culpability.\wj*”
\p
\v 16 ◘
\v 17 When Yeshua came back inside, his apprentices asked him what he meant.
\v 18 But he scolded them, “\wj Can’t you understand something so simple! Can’t you see that anything from the outside that enters your body doesn’t make you guilty in God’s sight,\wj*
\v 19 \wj because it doesn’t enter your mind but merely goes into your stomach and ends up in the toilet.\wj*” (By saying this he clearly showed that is was ok for Jews to eat any food.)
\p
\v 20 He continued, “\wj It’s what comes out of you that makes you guilty in God’s eyes.\wj*
\v 21-22 \wj That’s because evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, wickedness, deceit, arrogance, lust, slander, pride, and foolishness all come from \+em inside\+em* people’s hearts \+add and minds\+add*.\wj*
\v 23 \wj So it’s the evil that’s inside a person and comes out that makes them guilty in God’s eyes.\wj*”
\s1 The bold faith of a non-Jewish woman
\r (Mat. 15:21-28)
\p
\v 24 Yeshua left that place and went \add up north\add* into the regions of Tyre and Tsidon. He tried to enter a house without being noticed but didn’t succeed,
\v 25 and straight away a woman who had heard about him turned up. She knelt in front of him because she had a little daughter who was demon-possessed.
\v 26 The woman was Greek from Phoenicia in Syria and she begged Yeshua to command the demon to leave her daughter.
\v 27 But he replied, “\wj Let the \+add Jewish\+add* children be treated first, because it’s not good to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.\wj*”
\p
\v 28 And she responded, “Yes, \nd master\nd*, but the puppies under the table \em do\em* get to eat the little crumbs that the children drop.”
\p
\v 29 And he answered, “\wj Go home now. As a result of how you just spoke, the demon has already left your daughter.\wj*”
\p
\v 30 And when she got home, the demon had indeed gone and her little girl was lying quietly on her bed.
\s1 Yeshua heals a deaf man who couldn’t speak
\p
\v 31 Yeshua left the Tyre region, passed through Tsidon, and came down the \add eastern\add* side of the Lake of Galilee to the Decapolis region.
\v 32 The people there brought a man to him who couldn’t hear or speak, and asked Yeshua to heal him.
\v 33 So Yeshua took the man back away from the crowd, put his fingers in the man’s ears, then he spat and touched the man’s mouth.
\v 34 Looking up to the sky, he sighed and said, “\wj Open up!\wj*”
\p
\v 35 Then the man could hear, and his tongue was released and he began to speak properly.
\v 36 The Yeshua advised that they shouldn’t tell anyone, but the more he said that, the more they seemed to spread it around.
\v 37 The crowds were totally amazed, saying, “He can do anything—he makes the deaf able to hear, and enables the ones who couldn’t speak.”
\c 8
\s1 Yeshua feeds 4,000 people
\r (Mat. 15:32-39)
\p
\v 1 Another time there was a large crowd again with nothing to eat. Yeshua called his apprentices and told them,
\v 2 “\wj I feel sorry for all these people because they’ve already been with us for three days and don’t have anything to eat.\wj*
\v 3 \wj I can’t send them home because they’re too weak to walk, and some have a long way to go.\wj*”
\p
\v 4 His apprentices queried, “Where could anyone find enough food out here in the wilderness?”
\p
\v 5 He asked, “\wj How much bread have you all got?\wj*”
\p “Seven buns,” they answered.
\p
\v 6 So Yeshua instructed the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven buns, gave thanks and broke them and gave pieces to his apprentices to then distribute to the crowd.
\v 7 They also had a few small cooked fish, so he blessed them too and got them to distribute them as well.
\v 8 After all the people had eaten and were full, they collected seven basketfuls of leftovers.
\v 9 There were some four thousand people there that day, and Yeshua sent them home after they’d eaten.
\v 10 And he and his apprentices climbed into the boat and headed for the Dalmanutha region.
\s1 The religious leaders want to see a miracle
\r (Mat. 16:1-4)
\p
\v 11 \x + \xo 8:11: \xt Mat 12:38; Luk 11:16.\x*Some men from the Pharisee party came out to Yeshua and started arguing with him. They were checking him out and wanted to see a miracle.
\v 12 \x + \xo 8:12: \xt Mat 12:39; Luk 11:29.\x*Yeshua grieved inside and asked, “\wj Why do you people need to see a miracle before you’ll believe me? Actually, no miracle will be done for this generation.\wj*”
\p
\v 13 So Yeshua left in the boat again and crossed to the other side of the lake.
\s1 The apprentices miss the significance of what’s happening
\r (Mat. 16:5-12)
\p
\v 14 But Yeshua’s apprentices forgot to take any food other than one bun that someone in the boat had.
\v 15 \x + \xo 8:15: \xt Luk 12:1.\x*He told them, “\wj Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and of King Herod.\wj*”
\p
\v 16 They asked each other what it meant—was it because they forgot food?
\p
\v 17 But \nd Yeshua\nd* knew what they were saying and asked, “\wj Why are you all discussing about not having food? Can’t you figure it out? Or are your minds completely closed?\wj*
\v 18 \x + \xo 8:18: \xt Jer 5:21; Eze 12:2; Mrk 4:12.\x*\wj You all have eyes but can’t seem to see and have ears but can’t seem to listen. Have you already forgotten what just happened?\wj*
\v 19 \wj When I broke up the five buns to feed five thousand people, how many basketfuls of leftovers did you collect?\wj*”
\p “Twelve,” they answered.
\p
\v 20 “And when we fed four thousand with seven buns, how many full baskets of leftovers then?”
\p “Seven,” they answered.
\p
\v 21 Yeshua asked, “\wj How can you all not understand what’s going on right in front of you!\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua heals a blind man near Bethsaida
\p
\v 22 As they entered Bethsaida, the people brought a blind man to Yeshua and asked him to touch him.
\v 23 So Yeshua took the man’s hand and led him out of the village. Then he spat in his eyes, placed his hands on him, and asked him, “\wj What can you see?\wj*”
\p
\v 24 The man looked around and answered, “I can see the people, but they just look like trees.”
\v 25 Yeshua touched the man’s eyes again and then he could see clearly—he was now completely better.
\v 26 Then Yeshua told him not to go back into the village but to go straight home.
\s1 Yeshua asks who they think he is
\r (Mat. 16:13-20; Luke 9:18-21)
\p
\v 27 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* and his followers moved around the various villages of Caesaria Philippi. On the way, he asked them, “\wj Who does everyone think I am?\wj*”
\p
\v 28 \x + \xo 8:28: \xt Mrk 6:14-15; Luk 9:7-8.\x*They said, “Some say Yohan-the-immerser, some say Eliyyah, and some say one of the prophets.”
\p
\v 29 \x + \xo 8:29: \xt Yhn 6:68-69.\x*Then he asked, “\wj And what do you all think?\wj*”
\p Peter said, “You are the promised one sent by God.”
\p
\v 30 Then Yeshua warned them not to tell others about him.
\s1 Yeshua’s radical challenge to his would-be followers
\r (Mat. 16:21-28; Luke 9:22-27)
\p
\v 31 Then Yeshua began teaching his followers that humanity’s child would need to suffer a lot, to be rejected by the religious leaders, and so to be put to death but to come back to life after three days.
\v 32 He taught this very clearly, but Peter took him aside and told him off.
\v 33 Yeshua turned back and looked at the others, then reprimanded Peter, “\wj Stand back, Satan! you’re applying human values instead of considering God’s plan.\wj*”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 8:34: \xt Mat 10:38; Luk 14:27.\x*Calling out to them and to the crowd, he said, “\wj Anyone who wants to follow me must first put aside their own desires and then follow me—even through very difficult times.\wj*
\v 35 \x + \xo 8:35: \xt Yhn 12:25; Mat 10:39; Luk 17:33.\x*\wj Anyone who worries about saving their own life will lose it, but anyone who gives their life due to following me and my teaching will save their life.\wj*
\v 36 \wj Because it doesn’t benefit a person if they gain everything in the world but lose their soul.\wj*
\v 37 \wj What can someone offer in order to buy a home for their soul?\wj*
\v 38 \wj Yes, anyone who is ashamed of me and my message in front of this adulterous and sinful generation, humanity’s child will likewise be ashamed of them when he comes clearly displaying God’s greatness and bringing the holy messengers.\wj*”
\c 9
\p
\v 1 And he continued, “I can assure you that some of the ones standing here won’t die until they have seen God’s powerful kingdom arrive.”
\s1 Mosheh and Eliyyah speak with Yeshua
\r (Mat. 17:1-13; Luke 9:28-36)
\p
\v 2 \x + \xo 9:2-7: \xt 2Pe 1:17-18.\x*Six days later \nd Yeshua\nd* took Peter and Yacob and Yohan, and just the four of them went up onto a high hill. Then he was changed right in front of their eyes
\v 3 and his clothes turned incredibly shining white—whiter than any bleach could make them.
\v 4 And Eliyyah and Mosheh appeared beside \nd Yeshua\nd* and started talking with him.
\v 5 Peter said to \nd Yeshua\nd*, “Teacher, it’s good that we’re here. Maybe we could make three shelters up here: one for you and one for Mosheh and one for Eliyyah?”
\v 6 He said that because they were terrified and didn’t know what to say.
\p
\v 7 \x + \xo 9:7: \xt Mat 3:17; Mrk 1:11; Luk 3:22.\x*Then a cloud came over the sun and a voice came out of the cloud saying, “This is my dear son. Listen to him.”
\v 8 When they looked around, they couldn’t see anyone else there any more, except for \nd Yeshua\nd* himself.
\p
\v 9 As they descended again, Yeshua told them to tell no one what had happened up there until after humanity’s child came back to life.
\p
\v 10 They remembered that, although between all three of them they couldn’t understand the bit about coming back to life.
\v 11 \x + \xo 9:11: \xt Mal 4:5; Mat 11:14.\x*They asked Yeshua, “Isn’t it written that Eliyyah will be the first to return?”
\p
\v 12 He answered, “Yes, Eliyyah is indeed the one to come first to start the restoration. But isn’t it also written that humanity’s child will suffer a lot and be scorned?
\v 13 You see, Eliyyah has come already, and they treated him just however they liked, just like it was written that it would happen.”
\s1 Yeshua drives out a stubborn demon
\r (Mat. 17:14-21; Luke 9:37-43a)
\p
\v 14 When they got back to \add his other\add* followers, Yeshua saw that they were surrounded by a large crowd and the religious teachers were debating with them.
\v 15 The crowd were very surprised when they noticed Yeshua and came running to greet him.
\v 16 He asked them, “\wj What were you all talking about?\wj*”
\p
\v 17 One of the people answered, “Teacher, I brought my son here—he has a demon that prevents him from speaking.
\v 18 Whenever it takes hold of him, it attacks him and he starts foaming at the mouth and grating his teeth and his joints lock up. I tried to get your followers to command it to leave but they couldn’t.”
\p
\v 19 Yeshua replied, “\wj You are a faithless generation. How much longer will I have to be here? How much longer can I tolerate you all? Bring him here.\wj*”
\v 20 So they brought the boy to him. When he saw Yeshua, the demon immediately caused him to have convulsions and fall on the ground—rolling over and foaming at the mouth.
\p
\v 21 Yeshua asked his father, “\wj How long has this been happening?\wj*”
\p “Since he was small,” he replied,
\v 22 “and often it throws him into the fire or into water to try to destroy him. But if you feel sorry for us and can do it, please help us.”
\p
\v 23 \nd Yeshua\nd* asked him, “\wj If I can? A person who believes can do anything.\wj*”
\p
\v 24 The boys father cried out, “I do believe—help me to fight unbelief.”
\p
\v 25 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* noticing that a big crowd was quickly forming, scolded the evil spirit, “\wj You spirit who causes muteness and deafness. Leave this boy now and never return to him.\wj*”
\p
\v 26 There was yelling and strong convulsions, and then the demon left him and the boy lay still as if dead, and many people thought he was.
\v 27 But \nd Yeshua\nd* took his hand and lifted it, and the boy got up.
\p
\v 28 When Yeshua and his apprentices had gone into the house by themselves, they asked him, “How come we couldn’t drive it out?”
\p
\v 29 He replied, “\wj This kind will only leave after prayer and fasting.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua talks again about being executed
\r (Mat. 17:22-23; Luke 9:43b-45)
\p
\v 30 Then they left that place and were moving around Galilee, because Yeshua didn’t want people to know where he was
\v 31 while he was teaching his apprentices. He told them, “\wj Humanity’s child will be arrested and executed, but after three days he’ll come back to life.\wj*”
\p
\v 32 But they didn’t know what that meant, and they were too scared to ask him.
\s1 How to be the best
\r (Mat. 18:1-5; Luke 9:46-48)
\p
\v 33 Then they went to Capernaum and when they arrived at the house, Yeshua asked them what they were discussing on the way.
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 9:34: \xt Luk 22:24.\x*But they didn’t reply because while they were walking, they had been talking about which of them is the best.
\v 35 \x + \xo 9:35: \xt Mat 20:26-27; 23:11; Mrk 10:43-44; Luk 22:26.\x*So Yeshua sat down and called the twelve of them and explained, “\wj Anyone who wants to be at the top, has to be at the bottom and help all the others.\wj*”
\v 36 Then Yeshua called a young boy and stood him in the middle of them, and giving him a hug said,
\v 37 \x + \xo 9:37: \xt Yhn 13:20; Mat 10:40; Luk 10:16.\x*“\wj Whoever welcomes young children on my behalf, welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me is not actually welcoming me, but welcoming the one who sent me here.\wj*”
\s1 Others are also serving Yeshua
\r (Luke 9:49-50)
\p
\v 38 Yohan checked with Yeshua, “Teacher, we saw someone using your authority to command demons to leave, but we told him off because he wasn’t one of us.”
\p
\v 39 \nd Yeshua\nd* responded, “\wj No, don’t stop him because anyone who does a miracle using my name won’t just quickly turn around and slander me.\wj*
\v 40 \x + \xo 9:40: \xt Mat 12:30; Luk 11:23.\x*\wj Anyone who’s not against us is for us.\wj*
\v 41 \x + \xo 9:41: \xt Mat 10:42.\x*\wj \+nd Anyone\+nd* who gives you water to drink because you are followers of God’s \+nd chosen\+nd* one and who does it because they are working for me, I can assure you that they’ll receive their reward.\wj*
\s1 Difficult teachings about disobedience
\r (Mat. 18:6-9; Luke 17:1-2)
\p
\v 42 “\wj But anyone who causes a young person to falter from their trust in me, it would be better if they were thrown into the sea with a heavy weight tied around their neck.\wj*
\v 43 \x + \xo 9:43: \xt Mat 5:30.\x*\wj If your hand causes you to disobey God, cut it off—it’s better to enter \+add eternal\+add* life being maimed, than to have two hands but to be thrown into the fire that never goes out.\wj*
\v 44 ◘
\v 45 \wj And if your foot causes you to disobey God, cut it off—it’s better to enter \+add eternal\+add* life being maimed, than to have two feet but to be thrown into hell.\wj*
\v 46 ◘
\v 47 \x + \xo 9:47: \xt Mat 5:29.\x*\wj And if your eye causes you to disobey God, gouge it out—it’s better to enter God’s kingdom one-eyed, than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell\wj*
\v 48 \wj where the worms never die and the fire never goes out.\wj*
\p
\v 49 “\wj Everyone will be salted with fire.\wj*
\p
\v 50 \x + \xo 9:50: \xt Mat 5:13; Luk 14:34-35.\x*“\wj Now salt is good, but if it were to go bad, what would you season \+add your food\+add* with then? So keep yourselves like salt, and strive to get on well with each other.\wj*”
\c 10
\s1 It’s God that joins husband and wife
\r (Mat. 19:1-12; Luke 16:18)
\p
\v 1 Then Yeshua left \add Capernaum\add* and went down to the Yudean area and across the Yordan river. Again the crowds followed him, and he taught them just like he usually did.
\p
\v 2 Some from the Pharisee party approached Yeshua to check him out and asked, “Does the law allow a husband to dismiss his wife?”
\p
\v 3 “\wj Well, what law did Mosheh give to you all?\wj*” he asked.
\p
\v 4 \x + \xo 10:4: \xt Deu 24:1-4; Mat 5:31.\x*They answered, “Mosheh said that a husband is allowed to write a statement of divorce and dismiss his wife with it.”
\p
\v 5 \nd Yeshua\nd* responded, “\wj Yes, he wrote that law because he saw your stubborn desires,\wj*
\v 6 \x + \xo 10:6: \xt Gen 1:27; 5:2.\x*\wj but God made both men and women right at the beginning.\wj*
\v 7 \x + \xo 10:7-8: \xt Gen 2:24.\x*\wj As a result, a man leaves his parents and joins together with his wife\wj*
\v 8 \wj and the couple become a single unit. So there’s no longer two of them, but only one.\wj*
\v 9 \wj So if it’s \+nd God\+nd* who joins them together like that, no person \+add has the authority\+add* to separate them.\wj*”
\p
\v 10 Back in the house again, his apprentices asked about this.
\v 11 \x + \xo 10:11-12: \xt Mat 5:32; 1Cor 7:10-11.\x*And Yeshua told them, “\wj Whoever divorces his wife and marries another person, commits adultery towards his wife.\wj*”
\v 12 \wj And likewise if the wife divorces her husband and marries another person, she is committing adultery towards her husband.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua encourages childlike faith
\r (Mat. 19:13-15; Luke 18:15-17)
\p
\v 13 The people were bringing small children for Yeshua to touch, but his apprentices scolded them.
\v 14 However, \nd Yeshua\nd* noticed it and was upset, “\wj Just let those kids come. Don’t prevent them because God’s kingdom consists of people like them.\wj*
\v 15 \x + \xo 10:15: \xt Mat 18:3.\x*\wj Actually, you can’t even enter God’s kingdom unless you accept it just like a small child does.\wj*”
\v 16 So he continued hugging the children and \add commanding\add* a good life for them as he placed his hands on each one.
\s1 Leaving behind everything to be saved
\r (Mat. 19:16-30; Luke 18:18-30)
\p
\v 17 One time when Yeshua was starting out on a trip, a man caught up to him and kneeling down in front of him asked, “Good teacher, what do I have to do to inherit eternal life?”
\p
\v 18 He answered, “\wj Why do you call me \+em good\+em*? No person is good—only \+nd God\+nd* is.\wj*
\v 19 \x + \xo 10:19: a \xt Exo 20:13; Deu 5:17; \xo b \xt Exo 20:14; Deu 5:18; \xo c \xt Exo 20:15; Deu 5:19; \xo d \xt Exo 20:16; Deu 5:20; \xo e \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16.\x*\wj You know \+add God’s\+add* commands: don’t murder, don’t commit adultery, don’t steal, don’t lie about others, don’t defraud others, and honour your parents.\wj*”
\p
\v 20 The man responded, “I’ve kept all of those since I was young.”
\p
\v 21 \nd Yeshua\nd* looked up at him with genuine love and said, “\wj There’s one thing still to be done: sell everything you have and give the money to the poor—then you’ll have wealth in heaven. After that, come and follow me.\wj*”
\v 22 But the man grew very sad when he heard this, because he owned many properties.
\p
\v 23 \nd Yeshua\nd* looked around at his followers, “\wj It’s so difficult for wealthy people to enter God’s kingdom.\wj*”
\p
\v 24 (His followers were a bit stunned at his teaching.) \nd Yeshua\nd* continued, “\wj Yes, it’s certainly difficult to enter into God’s kingdom.\wj*
\v 25 \wj It’s easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter God’s kingdom.\wj*”
\p
\v 26 Now they were totally stunned, asking, “How can anyone possibly be saved then?”
\p
\v 27 \nd Yeshua\nd* looked intently at them, “\wj Yes, humanly it’s quite impossible. But with God it’s different—God can do anything!\wj*”
\p
\v 28 Peter said, “We left everything and came and followed you.”
\p
\v 29 He answered, “\wj Yes I can assure you all that anyone who left their home or farm, and left their siblings or parents or children because of me and my teaching,\wj*
\v 30 \wj they’ll be rewarded one hundred times over with homes and farms and siblings and parents and children along with persecution, but gaining eternal life in the next era.\wj*
\v 31 \x + \xo 10:31: \xt Mat 20:16; Luk 13:30.\x*\wj But many at the top now will be at the bottom then, and many at the bottom now will be blessed then.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua predicts his execution a third time
\r (Mat. 20:17-19; Luke 18:31-34)
\p
\v 32 They were \add heading south\add* on their way to Yerushalem with Yeshua in front, and his followers were a bit surprised and a bit scared. Yeshua took the twelve aside and started telling them what was going to happen to him,
\v 33 “\wj We’re on our way down to Yerushalem and humanity’s child will be turned over to the chief priests and the religious teachers, and they’ll sentence him to die and pass him over to the non-Jews.\wj*
\v 34 \wj Then they’ll ridicule him and spit on him before they beat him and execute him, but he’ll come back to life again in three days time.\wj*”
\s1 How to become respected in God’s kingdom
\r (Mat. 20:20-28)
\p
\v 35 Then Yacob and Yohan, the two sons of Zebedee approached Yeshua and asked, “Teacher, we’d like to ask a favour from you—please don’t disappoint us.”
\p
\v 36 “\wj What do you want from me?\wj*” Yeshua asked.
\p
\v 37 They answered, “Allow us two to sit beside you in heaven—one of us on each side of you.”
\p
\v 38 \x + \xo 10:38: \xt Luk 12:50.\x*But \nd Yeshua\nd* replied, “\wj You don’t even understand what you’re asking for. Do you think you could endure the suffering that I have to go through? Or to be enveloped in the darkness that I have to go down into?\wj*”
\p
\v 39 And they replied, “Sure we can.”
\p “\wj And indeed you all will suffer like me and be enveloped in darkness like I will be,\wj*” responded \nd Yeshua\nd*,
\v 40 “\wj but as for deciding who will sit next to me, that’s not my decision to make because it’s already been decided.\wj*”
\p
\v 41 When the ten other apprentices heard what these two had asked for, they were upset at Yacob and Yohan.
\v 42 \x + \xo 10:42-43: \xt Luk 22:25-26.\x*But \nd Yeshua\nd* called them over, “\wj Listen, in most countries their rulers boss the people around and their leaders exert their authority over them.\wj*
\v 43 \x + \xo 10:43-44: \xt Mat 23:11; Mrk 9:35; Luk 22:26.\x*\wj But it doesn’t work like that with you—anyone of you who wanted to be honoured must serve the others,\wj*
\v 44 \wj and anyone who wants to become the most respected has to \+add work\+add* like a slave does.\wj*
\v 45 \wj Even humanity’s child didn’t come to be served, but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom to set many people free.\wj*”
\s1 Blind Bartimeus gets his miracle
\r (Mat. 20:29-34; Luke 18:35-43)
\p
\v 46 They arrived at Jericho, and then when Yeshua and his followers were leaving again with a large crowd following, they came across blind Bartimeus sitting beside the path begging.
\v 47 When he heard that it was Yeshua from \nd Nazareth\nd* going past, he yelled out, “Yeshua, \add promised\add* descendant of David, help me please.”
\p
\v 48 When several people told him to stop, he just yelled out even louder, “Yeshua, \add promised\add* descendant of David, please help me.”
\p
\v 49 Then \nd Yeshua\nd* stopped and got the people to call the blind man. So they called him, “Hey, be confident! Get up and come because he’s called for you.”
\p
\v 50 So Bartimeus threw off his jacket, jumped up, and was led to \nd Yeshua\nd*.
\p
\v 51 “\wj Now, what can I do for you?\wj*” \nd Yeshua\nd* asked.
\p “My teacher, I’d like to be able to see,” Bartimeus replied.
\p
\v 52 Then Yeshua responded, “\wj Okay, off you go then—your faith has saved you.\wj*”
\p And immediately Bartimeus was able to see, and followed along the path after Yeshua.
\c 11
\s1 Yeshua is treated like a king as he enters Yerushalem
\r (Yhn 12:12-19; Mat. 21:1-11; Luke 19:28-40)
\p
\v 1 As they got close to Yerushalem and were passing Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives, Yeshua sent two of his apprentices ahead, telling them,
\v 2 “\wj Go on to the next village and as you enter it, you’ll see a young donkey that hasn’t ever been ridden yet. Untie it and bring it back here.\wj*
\v 3 \wj If anyone asks what you’re doing, tell them that the \+nd master\+nd* needs it and he’ll return it later.\wj*”
\p
\v 4 So they went ahead and found a donkey tied up on the path just outside the door of a house, and so they went to untie it.
\v 5 But some of the people standing around there said, “Hoy! What do you think you’re doing untying that donkey?”
\p
\v 6 So they responded just as \nd Yeshua\nd* had told them, and the people allowed them to proceed.
\v 7 They brought the young donkey to Yeshua, placing their coats over it before Yeshua mounted it.
\v 8 \add As Yeshua rode it into Yerushalem,\add* many people laid their coats on the road, while others lay down leafy branches cut from trees in nearby fields.
\v 9 \x + \xo 11:9: \xt Psa 118:25-26.\x*Some went ahead and others came along behind, shouting, “This is the saviour who comes with the authority and blessing from \nd Yahweh\nd*—
\v 10 the promised ancestor of King David who is blessed as he ushers in his kingdom—the blessed saviour from heaven.”
\p
\v 11 And so Yeshua arrived in Yerushalem and went into the temple and looked all around, but because it was now evening, he went back out to Bethania village with his twelve apprentices.
\s1 Yeshua curses a fig tree
\r (Mat. 21:18-19)
\p
\v 12 The next day after they’d left Bethania, Yeshua was hungry.
\v 13 From a distance he noticed a fig tree that was in leaf so he went over to see if there was any fruit on it, but when he reached it there was only leaves because it wasn’t the right season for figs.
\v 14 So he spoke to the tree, “\wj No one in this age will ever eat fruit from you again.\wj*” (His followers heard him say that.)
\s1 Yeshua upsets the traders inside the temple
\r (Yhn 2:13-22; Mat. 21:12-17; Luke 19:45-48)
\p
\v 15 Then they came back into Yerushalem and on into the temple where Yeshua started driving out the sellers and the buyers that were trading in there. Then he tipped over the tables of the money-changers and the chairs of the ones selling doves,
\v 16 and stopped others from carrying goods through the temple.
\v 17 \x + \xo 11:17: a \xt Isa 56:7; \xo b \xt Jer 7:11.\x*He said, “\wj Isn’t it written in the Scriptures,\wj*
\q1 \wj ‘My house will be known as a house of prayer for all the nations’?\wj*
\m \wj But all of you have turned it into a sanctuary for swindlers.\wj*”
\p
\v 18 When the chief priests and the religious teachers heard this, they started looking for a way that they could destroy him, because they were afraid of him and the way that the crowd marvelled at his teaching.
\p
\v 19 Every evening, Yeshua and his apprentices would go out of the city to stay overnight.
\s1 Yeshua gives a lesson on moving mountains
\r (Mat. 21:20-22)
\p
\v 20 As they entered the city again in the morning, Yeshua’s apprentices noticed that the fig tree was totally dead.
\v 21 Peter remembered what he had said to the tree, and commented, “Teacher, that fig tree that you cursed has withered up.”
\p
\v 22 \nd Yeshua\nd* responded, “\wj Use your faith in \+nd God\+nd*.\wj*
\v 23 \x + \xo 11:23: \xt Mat 17:20; 1Cor 13:2.\x*\wj I can assure you that if anyone tells a mountain to go into the sea and doesn’t doubt in their mind but believes that what they’re saying will happen, then it will.\wj*
\v 24 \wj So I tell you all that anything you ask God for in your prayers, if you believe that you have received it, then you will.\wj*
\v 25 \x + \xo 11:25-26: \xt Mat 6:14-15.\x*\wj Whenever you are standing praying, if you have something against someone, be sure to forgive them so that your father in heaven can also forgive your shortcomings.\wj*”
\s1 The leaders question Yeshua’s authority
\r (Mat. 21:23-27; Luke 20:1-8)
\p
\v 26 ◘
\v 27 They continued on into Yerushalem and on to the temple where they were met by the chief priests and the religious teachers and the elders.
\v 28 They asked Yeshua, “Do you have any authority to do what you did? If so, who gave it to you?”
\p
\v 29 \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj Okay, I’ll also ask you something and when you answer me I’ll tell you about my authority to do that:\wj*
\v 30 \wj When Yohan \+add preached and\+add* immersed people, did the authority for that come from heaven or from people here?\wj*”
\p
\v 31 They discussed this among themselves, reasoning, “If we say it was from heaven, he’ll ask us why we didn’t believe him.
\v 32 But we can’t say that it was just from people.” (They said that because they were scared of the crowds, knowing that they believed that Yohan was a prophet.)
\v 33 So they answered, “We don’t know.”
\p And \nd Yeshua\nd* also responded, “\wj Well then, I won’t tell you about my authority to do those things either.\wj*”
\c 12
\s1 The parable about the tenants killing the owner’s son
\r (Mat. 21:33-46; Luke 20:9-19)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 12:1: \xt Isa 5:1-2.\x*Then he started telling them some parables: “\wj A man planted a vineyard and put a fence and a moat around it and built a \+add security\+add* tower. Then he rented it out and went off travelling.\wj*
\v 2 \wj At harvest time, he sent a slave to go to the tenant farmers and get his \+add percentage\+add* of the harvest.\wj*
\v 3 \wj But the tenants grabbed the slave and beat him up, then sent him back empty-handed.\wj*
\v 4 \wj The owner sent a second slave, but they insulted this one and struck him on the head.\wj*
\v 5 \wj So the owner sent a third slave and they murdered him. He sent many other slaves—some they just beat up and others they murdered.\wj*
\v 6 \wj But the owner still had his one, dearly loved son, so finally he sent him to go, thinking that they would now be convinced because it was his son.\wj*
\v 7 \wj But the tenant farmers said to each others, ‘Ah ha. This is the one who will inherit this land. If we kill \+em him\+em*, we’ll be the ones to control the estate.’\wj*
\v 8 \wj So they took him and killed him, and threw the body outside the vineyard fence.\wj*
\p
\v 9 “\wj Now, what do you think the owner of the vineyard will do? Yes, he’ll come and eliminate those \+add evil\+add* tenants, and give the contract to others.\wj*
\v 10 \x + \xo 12:10-11: \xt Psa 118:22-23.\x*\wj Haven’t you all read this in the scriptures:\wj*
\q1 \wj ‘the stone that the builders rejected\wj*
\q1 \wj became the \+add important\+add* cornerstone\wj*
\q1
\v 11 \wj that was given by \+nd Yahweh\+nd*,\wj*
\q1 \wj and we think it’s incredible.’?\wj*”
\p
\v 12 And those leaders tried to arrest him because they knew that it was them that the parable was addressed to, but they couldn’t do it because \add Yeshua had the favour\add* of the crowd, so they just left the area.
\s1 Yeshua answers about payment of taxes
\r (Mat. 22:15-22; Luke 20:20-26)
\p
\v 13 Then the religious leaders sent some members of the Pharisee party and some of the \add political\add* supporters of King Herod to try to catch Yeshua out.
\v 14 So they \add flattered\add* him, “Teacher, we know that you are honest even if it upsets others, and that you teach the truth about \nd God\nd* without caring about people’s opinions. Is it legal \add for us Jews\add* to pay the poll tax to the Roman emperor or not? How should we handle this?”
\p
\v 15 But knowing their hypocrisy, Yeshua responded to them, “\wj Why are you trying to test me? Bring me a coin so we can determine the proper answer.\wj*”
\p
\v 16 When they brought him a coin, he asked, “\wj Whose image and inscription are on this coin?\wj*”
\p And they said, “The emperor’s.”
\p
\v 17 “\wj Well then,\wj*” said \nd Yeshua\nd*, “\wj give to the emperor whatever is due him, but give God what is owed to God.\wj*”
\p And they had to admit that that was an outstanding answer.
\s1 Yeshua explains that those who’ve died are alive
\r (Mat. 22:23-33; Luke 20:27-40)
\p
\v 18 \x + \xo 12:18: \xt Acts 23:8.\x*Another time, members of the Sadducee sect came to Yeshua and asked,
\v 19 \x + \xo 12:19: \xt Deu 25:5.\x*“Teacher, Mosheh wrote that if a man’s married brother should die before his wife without having any children, then his brother should marry her to produce descendants in his brother’s name.
\v 20 Now what if there were seven brothers and the first one got married and died childless.
\v 21 So then the second brother took her in, but again died childless, and then the third.
\v 22 Eventually all seven brothers died childless, and finally the woman also died.
\v 23 Now, at the resurrection of the dead, which brother will she be the wife of, because at some point, she was married to each of the seven of them?”
\p
\v 24 So \nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj Actually you’re all quite wrong, because you ignore the scriptures and also because you haven’t experienced God’s power.\wj*
\v 25 \wj When the dead do come back to life, they won’t be getting engaged or married, but will be like the messengers in heaven.\wj*
\v 26 \x + \xo 12:26: \xt Exo 3:6.\x*\wj And as for the state of those who’ve died, didn’t you read in the scriptures about Mosheh when God spoke to him in front of the \+add burning\+add* thorn bush and said, ‘I \+em am\+em* the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Yacob’?\wj*
\v 27 \wj So God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You Sadducees are very wrong!\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua answers about genuine obedience to God
\r (Mat. 22:34-40; Luke 10:25-28)
\p
\v 28 Then one of the religious teachers who had heard their question and Yeshua’s excellent answer, came closer and asked, “Which of \+add God’s\+add* commands is the most important?”
\p
\v 29 \x + \xo 12:29-30: \xt Deu 6:4-5.\x*\nd Yeshua\nd* answered, “\wj Well, the most important is this: ‘Listen, Israel. Our \+nd God Yahweh\+nd* is \add our\add* master.\wj*
\v 30 \wj You must love \+nd Yahweh God\+nd* with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’\wj*
\v 31 \x + \xo 12:31: \xt Lev 19:18.\x*\wj And the second is: ‘Love your neighbour like \+add you look after\+add* yourself.’ There’s no other commands more important than these.\wj*”
\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 12:32: \xt Deu 4:35.\x*The teacher replied to Yeshua, “Yes, teacher, you’re quite right saying there’s only one God and no other,
\v 33 \x + \xo 12:33: \xt Hos 6:6.\x*and saying that we should love him with all our heart and all our intelligence and all our strength, and to be loving our neighbours like we \add look after\add* ourselves, and all this is more important than all the required temple offerings and sacrifices.”
\p
\v 34 \x + \xo 12:28-34: \xt Luk 10:25-28.\x*When Yeshua saw that he had given such a thoughtful answer, he said, “\wj You are very close to the kingdom of \+nd God\+nd*!\wj*”
\p After that, no one else dared to ask Yeshua any more questions.
\s1 Yeshua asks about the messiah being a descendant of David
\r (Mat. 22:41-46; Luke 20:41-44)
\p
\v 35 Later when \nd Yeshua\nd* was teaching in the temple, he asked the people, “\wj How is it that the teachers here say that the \+nd messiah\+nd* is a descendant of King David?\wj*
\v 36 \x + \xo 12:36: \xt Psa 110:1.\x*\wj Because David himself said under the inspiration of the holy \+nd spirit\+nd*,\wj*
\q1 \wj ‘The \+nd master\+nd* told my \+nd master\+nd*,\wj*
\q2 \wj “Sit there in the position of honour\wj*
\q2 \wj until I can conquer your enemies.” ’\wj*
\m
\v 37 \wj If David calls \add the messiah\add* his \+nd master\+nd*, how can \add the messiah\add* possibly be \add David’s\add* descendant?\wj*”
\p The large crowd was very interested to hear everything that Yeshua had to say.
\s1 Yeshua warns about well-dressed teachers
\r (Mat. 23:1-36; Luke 20:45-47)
\p
\v 38 As Yeshua continued teaching, he said, “\wj Watch out for these religious teachers who like to wear \+add fancy\+add* robes and be greeted in the square,\wj*
\v 39 \wj and have the best seats at meetings and the best places at dinners.\wj*
\v 40 \wj These people trick widows out of their properties, but offer long prayers to cover it up. They will be getting a stricter judgement than others.\wj*”
\s1 The sacrificial donation of a widow
\r (Luke 21:1-4)
\p
\v 41 As he sat down in front of the \add temple\add* treasury, Yeshua watched the crowd as they threw coins into \add the dish\add*, and some rich people were donating quite valuable \add silver\add* coins.
\v 42 Then an impoverished widow came and threw in two small \add copper\add* coins.
\v 43 Yeshua called his followers and told them, “\wj Honestly, that poor widow gave more than all the others.\wj*
\v 44 \wj You see, most people donate from their excess wealth, but this woman even gave \+add some of\+add* the small amount that she needed to live on.\wj*”
\c 13
\s1 Yeshua predicts total destruction of the temple
\r (Mat. 24:1-2; Luke 21:5-6)
\p
\v 1 As they were leaving the temple area, one of Yeshua’s followers noted, “Teacher, look at those \add large, chiselled\add* stones and the \add beautiful\add* buildings \add that they’ve been made into\add*.”
\p
\v 2 But \nd Yeshua\nd* responded, “\wj Yes, incredible buildings, but \+add the time will come\+add* when they’re torn down—not a single \+add piece of\+add* stone will be left sitting in its place.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua talks about coming hardships
\r (Mat. 24:3-14; Luke 21:7-19)
\p
\v 3 Later when they were over on the Mount of Olives overlooking the temple, Peter and Yacob and Yohan and Andrew were with Yeshua and asked
\v 4 when all this destruction would happen, and what indications there would be that it would be about to happen.
\p
\v 5 So \nd Yeshua\nd* told them, “\wj Be careful so you aren’t misled by others.\wj*
\v 6 \wj Plenty of people will say that they’re coming \+add ≈because they were sent by me\+add*, or that they \+em are\+em* me, and they’ll mislead many others.\wj*
\v 7 \wj And whenever you hear about wars or about battles about to begin, don’t be worried—those things will certainly happen, but there’s more to follow.\wj*
\v 8 \wj Countries will take up arms against other countries, and kingdoms against other kingdoms. There’ll be earthquakes in \+add many\+add* places and there’ll be famines, but those will be just like the beginning of birth pains.\wj*
\p
\v 9 \x + \xo 13:9-11: \xt Mat 10:17-20; Luk 12:11-12.\x*“\wj So be careful. You’ll be turned over to \+add local\+add* councils \+add for questioning\+add*, will be whipped in the religious meeting halls, and will be stood in front of governors and kings because of following me. But you’ll be able to present your life stories to them\wj*
\v 10 \wj and it’s right that the good news first\f + \fr 13:10 \ft TD: It’s not clear here what was meant by ‘first’—‘first’ before what?\f* be proclaimed to every people group.\wj*
\v 11 \wj But whenever they bring you along to hand you over, don’t worry in advance about what you’re going to say to defend yourselves, but wait until the hearing proceeds and speak what you are given then, because then it won’t be you speaking, but God’s \+nd spirit\+nd*.\wj*
\v 12 \wj In those times, a brother will report on his brother to have him executed, and a father report on his child, and children will be encouraged to report on their own parents and then they’ll be executed as a result.\wj*
\v 13 \x + \xo 13:13: \xt Mat 10:22.\x*\wj And every one will hate you all because they hate my name, but anyone who endures to the end will be saved.\wj*
\s1 Yeshua warns about coming horror and deceptions
\r (Mat. 24:15-28; Luke 21:20-24)
\p
\v 14 \x + \xo 13:14: \xt Dan 9:27; 11:31; 12:11.\x*“\wj But whenever you see the most horrible thing that drives people from God, standing where it shouldn’t be (and you readers should understand this), then anyone in Yudea should flee into the hills\wj*
\v 15 \x + \xo 13:15-16: \xt Luk 17:31.\x*\wj and anyone upstairs looking outside shouldn’t come down into the bedrooms to get anything,\wj*
\v 16 \wj and anyone working outside shouldn’t go back inside to get a change of clothes.\wj*
\v 17 \wj It will be extremely difficult for pregnant women and for mothers who are breast-feeding their children in those days.\wj*
\v 18 \wj Just pray that it won’t happen in the winter\wj*
\v 19 \x + \xo 13:19: \xt Dan 12:1; Rev 7:14.\x*\wj because those days will be terrible like nothing that’s ever happened before, all the way back to when \+nd God\+nd* created the world right until the present time, and won’t ever happen again.\wj*
\v 20 \wj And if \+nd Yahweh\+nd* hadn’t shortened that time, no humans would even survive, but he shortened that time so that the chosen ones could be saved.\wj*
\p
\v 21 \wj So don’t believe it if you hear someone say, ‘Look, the \+nd messiah\+nd* has arrived here.’ or ‘There’s the one that God has sent.’\wj*
\v 22 \wj Plenty of fake messiahs and deceiving prophets will certainly come and even do things that humans can’t normally do, so much so that even the chosen ones would defect if that were possible.\wj*
\v 23 \wj So watch out, but I’ve warned you in advance about all of this.\wj*
\s1 The universe collapses as the son arrives
\r (Mat. 24:29-31; Luke 21:25-28)

\v 28 “\wj So learn a lesson from fig trees—whenever the branches green up and start sprouting leaves and then everyone knows that summer is close.\wj*

\v 31 \wj The sky and the planet might collapse, but my teachings will never become irrelevant.\wj*
\s1 Stay alert for the coming of the master

\p
\v 32 \x + \xo 13:32: \xt Mat 24:36.\x*“\wj But as for the date or time when all this will happen, only the father knows that—even the son and messengers don’t know.\wj*

\v 37 \wj And what I’m telling you now, I tell everyone: stay alert and watch.\wj*”

\s1 The leaders plan to eliminate Yeshua
\r (Yhn 11:45-53; Mat. 26:1-5; Luke 22:1-2)
\p
\v 1 \x + \xo 14:1: \xt Exo 12:1-27.\x*Now it was two days before the Passover Feast and the \it Flat Bread Celebration\it*, and the chief priests and the religious teachers were trying to figure out how they could have Yeshua set up so they could arrest him and have him executed,
\v 2 but they knew that the Feast wouldn’t be a good time because the people would protest \add in Yeshua’s favour\add*.
\s1 The woman anoints Yeshua for his burial
\r (Yhn 12:1-8; Mat. 26:6-13)
\p
\v 3 \x + \xo 14:3: \xt Luk 7:37-38.\x*Meanwhile, Yeshua was in Bethany at the home of Simon who had previously had leprosy. Yeshua was sitting there when a woman came in with a hand-crafted container of very expensive fragrant oil. Breaking open the sealed flask, she poured the fragrant oil over Yeshua’s head.
\v 4 Immediately some started quietly grumbling about the extravagant waste,
\v 5 then they scolded the woman because a flask of genuine lotion like this could easily fetch almost a year’s wages if it was sold.
\p
\v 6 But \nd Yeshua\nd* spoke up, “\wj What do you think you’re doing abusing her—leave her alone! She’s done something very good for me.\wj*
\v 7 \x + \xo 14:7: \xt Deu 15:11.\x*\wj You’ll always have poor people around, and you can help them whenever you want to, but I won’t be around forever.\wj*
\v 8 \wj She has performed the traditional anointing of my body in advance of my burial.\wj*
\v 9 \wj And I can assure you that wherever the good news is proclaimed around the world, what she has done today will be part of the story and she’ll be remembered for it.\wj*”
\s1 Yudas offers to hand Yeshua over
\r (Mat. 26:14-16; Luke 22:3-6)
\p
\v 10 Then Yudas Iscariot, one of Yeshua’s twelve \add apprentices\add*, visited the chief priests to offer to hand Yeshua over to them.
\v 11 When they heard this, they were very pleased and promised to pay him well, and Yudas asked them about the most convenient way for them to get hold of Yeshua.
\s1 Yeshua’s apprentices prepare the Passover meal
\r (Yhn 13:21-30; Mat. 26:17-25; Luke 22:7-14, 21-23)
\p
\v 12 On the first day of the \it Flat Bread Celebration\it* when the lambs would be slaughtered ready for the special Passover meal, Yeshua’s apprentices asked him, “Where do you want us to get everything ready for our Passover meal?”
\p
\v 13 So Yeshua sent off two of them with these instructions, “\wj Go into town and a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you there. Just follow him\wj*
\v 14 \wj until he goes into a house. Then find the owner of the house and tell him that the teacher wants to know the location of the guestroom where he and his apprentices can celebrate the Passover meal.\wj*
\v 15 \wj He’ll show you a large, furnished room upstairs—that’s where you can get everything ready.\wj*”
\p
\v 16 So the two of them went off into the town, and everything happened there exactly as Yeshua had told them, and so they prepared the special meal there.
\s1 Yeshua shocks his apprentices at the Passover meal
\r (Yhn 13:21-30; Mat. 26:20-30; Luke 22:14-23; 1 Cor. 11:23-25)
\p
\v 17 As the evening approached, Yeshua went in for dinner with his twelve apprentices.
\v 18 \x + \xo 14:18: \xt Psa 41:9.\x*As they were sitting around eating, he told them, “\wj I’ll tell you frankly that one of you eating with me here will hand me over \+add to be arrested\+add*.\wj*”
\v 19 That upset them, and several of them individually asked, “Surely it couldn’t be me?”
\p
\v 20 Then he continued, “\wj It’s one of you twelve—the one who dips his bread in the sauce at the same time as me.\wj*
\v 21 \wj Indeed it’s written \+add in the scriptures\+add* that humanity’s child will be arrested, but on the other hand, what a tragedy it’ll be for the one who hands him over—in fact it would be better for that man if he was never born.\wj*”
\p
\v 22 As they carried on eating, he took some bread, blessed \add God\add*, broke it apart and gave a piece to them, saying, “\wj Take this bread—it’s my body.\wj*”
\p
\v 23 Then he picked up a cup, gave thanks \add to God\add*, and passed it around so they could each drink from it,
\v 24 \x + \xo 14:24: a \xt Exo 24:8; \xo b \xt Jer 31:31-34.\x*saying, “\wj This is the blood of my contract that will be poured out for many \+add people\+add*.\wj*
\v 25 \wj I can assure you that I won’t drink anything made from grapes until I drink new juice in God’s kingdom.\wj*”
\p
\v 26 And after they’d sung some songs, they left the town and went across to the Mount of Olives.
\s1 Yeshua predicts Peters denials
\r (Yhn 13:36-38; Mat. 26:31-35; Luke 22:31-34)
\p
\v 27 \x + \xo 14:27: \xt Zech 13:7.\x*Then \nd Yeshua\nd* continued his teaching, “\wj All of you will stumble because it’s written in the scriptures: ‘I’ll strike down the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered.’\wj*
\v 28 \x + \xo 14:28: \xt Mat 28:16.\x*\wj But after I come back to life, I’ll go on ahead of you back to Galilee.\wj*”
\p
\v 29 But Peter contradicted him, “Even if everyone else stumbles, I won’t!”
\p
\v 30 And \nd Yeshua\nd* responded, “\wj I can assure you that you’ll renounce me three times this very night, before the rooster crows early tomorrow morning.\wj*”
\p
\v 31 But Peter argued forcibly, “Even if I had to die with you, I would never disown you!”
\p And all the others said similar things.
\s1 Yeshua, in distress, prays at Gethsemane
\r (Mat. 26:36-46; Luke 22:39-46)
\p
\v 32 They walked along until they came to a piece of land called Gethsemane where Yeshua told his apprentices to sit down while he prayed.
\v 33 He took Peter and Yacob and Yohan further in with him where he stared off in a daze but was obviously very distressed.
\v 34 He told the three of them, “\wj My soul is deathly sad! You guys just stay here and keep alert.\wj*”
\p
\v 35 He went ahead a little way, where he knelt on the ground with his head down and prayed—asking if it was possible to avoid what was ahead of him.
\v 36 But he said, “\wj Father, I know that you can do anything. Let me avoid this suffering, but yes I do know, it doesn’t matter what I want but rather what you’ve \+add planned\+add*.\wj*”
\p
\v 37 Then he went back and found the others sleeping. He asked Peter, “\wj Simon, are you asleep? Couldn’t you stay awake even for a single hour?\wj*
\v 38 \wj You all need to stay alert and be careful not to give into temptation. I know your spirits are enthusiastic on one hand, but it’s still easy to give in to the moment.\wj*”
\p
\v 39 Then he went further in again and prayed as before,
\v 40 but when he returned again, he found them all asleep because they were tired, but they couldn’t really find any excuse to give.
\p
\v 41 The third time that Yeshua returned, he said to them, “\wj Ah, you’re all sleeping again and having a good rest. It’s well earned but the time has come for humanity’s child to be handed over to evil men.\wj*
\v 42 \wj Come on—get up—we need to go! Look, the one who’ll hand me over is on his way.\wj*”
\s1 Yeshua is arrested in the night
\r (Yhn 18:3-12; Mat. 26:47-56; Luke 22:47-53)
\p
\v 43 Even while Yeshua was still speaking, Yudas reached him, followed by a crowd from the chief priests, the religious teachers, and the elders—many armed with swords and clubs.
\v 44 Yudas had prearranged a signal with them that anyone who he greeted with a kiss, they should grab that person and lead him away under guard.
\p
\v 45 So he walked right up to Yeshua and said, “My honoured teacher,” and greeted him with a kiss.
\v 46 Then the others with him grabbed Yeshua and secured him.
\v 47 But one of the ones with Yeshua that was beside him, drew his sword and struck a slave of the chief priest, cutting off the man’s ear.
\v 48 \nd Yeshua\nd* spoke to the crowd, “\wj Did you all bring swords and clubs to try to capture me like you’d chase down a thief?\wj*
\v 49 \x + \xo 14:49: \xt Luk 19:47; 21:37.\x*\wj I was standing there teaching in the temple every day and you could have arrested me, but it’s happened this way to ensure that the what’s written in scriptures will be fulfilled.\wj*”
\p
\v 50 Meanwhile, the others who’d been with Yeshua had taken off.
\v 51 One young fellow was wearing a single linen robe, and when the crowd tried to grab him,
\v 52 it came off \add in the struggle\add* and he ran away stark naked.
\s1 The mock trial where Yeshua is sentenced to death
\r (Yhn 18:13-14,19-24; Mat. 26:57-68; Luke 22:54-55,63-71)
\p
\v 53 The guards led \nd Yeshua\nd* away to the chief priest’s residence, and all the chief priests and the elders and the religious teachers gathered there also.
\v 54 Peter followed along from a distance and went in as far as the courtyard of the residence where he joined the servants who were sitting around the fire keeping warm.
\v 55 Inside, the chief priests and all the council were trying to establish a case against \nd Yeshua\nd* so he could be sentenced to death, but they weren’t coming up with anything.
\v 56 Several people were making up charges against him, but none of the accusers’ stories agreed with each other.
\p
\v 57 Eventually some of them stood up and offered this false charge:
\v 58 \x + \xo 14:58: \xt Yhn 2:19.\x*“We heard him say that he would demolish this temple made by many labourers, and within three days he’d build another one without any helpers.”
\v 59 But even then, they couldn’t get their accusations to align with each other.
\p
\v 60 Nevertheless the chief priest in the middle of the council stood up and asked \nd Yeshua\nd*, “Aren’t you going to defend yourself? These men are accusing you of these things.”
\p
\v 61 But Yeshua didn’t say anything. So the chief priest asked again, “Is it true that you’re the \nd chosen\nd* one that God promised to send—the son of the blessed \add God\add*?”
\p
\v 62 \x + \xo 14:62: \xt Dan 7:13.\x*\nd Yeshua\nd* replied, “I am. And you will all see humanity’s child sitting in the honoured position by the powerful God and coming through the clouds in the sky.”
\p
\v 63 Then the chief priest tore his own robe \add to show his disgust\add* and shouted, “We certainly don’t need any more witnesses now!
\v 64 \x + \xo 14:64: \xt Lev 24:16.\x*You yourselves all heard him insult God. What sentence does that deserve?”
\p So the leaders there agreed that Yeshua needed to be sentenced to death.
\p
\v 65 Then various people started spitting on him, and blindfolding him and beating him saying, “Ha, tell us who that was!” Even the servants joined in to slap him.
\s1 Peter disowns Yeshua
\r (Yhn 18:15-18,25-27; Mat. 26:69-75; Luke 22:56-62)
\p
\v 66 Meanwhile, Peter was down in the courtyard when one of the chief priest’s servant girls came out,
\v 67 and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked more closely and said, “Hey, you were with that \nd Yeshua\nd* from \nd Nazareth\nd*!”
\p
\v 68 But he denied it, “I don’t know him and I don’t know why you think I would!” And he moved away from the fire.
\p
\v 69 But the girl that had seen him said to some of the others standing around, “That guy’s one of them.”
\p
\v 70 But again Peter denied it.
\p A little while later, some of those standing there said, “You must be one of them because you’re from Galilee.”
\p
\v 71 Now Peter started swearing and cursing and said, “I’ve never even met that fellow that you’re all talking about!”
\p
\v 72 Right then the rooster crowed for the second time and Peter remembered now what Yeshua had told him—how he would renounce Yeshua three times before the rooster crowed—and he broke down and cried.
\c 15
\s1 Pilate tries to interrogate Yeshua
\r (Yhn 18:28-38; Mat. 27:1-2,11-14; Luke 23:1-5)
\p
\v 1 First thing in the morning, the chief priests called a meeting with the elders and the religious teachers and all the council, and they ordered that \nd Yeshua\nd* be tied up and taken over to Governor Pilate.
\v 2 There Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”
\p “\wj You said it,\wj*” replied Yeshua.
\p
\v 3 Then the chief priests started hurling accusations against Yeshua,
\v 4 so Pilate asked him again, “Don’t you have anything to say? Listen to all these accusations they’re making against you.”
\p
\v 5 But Pilate was astounded that \nd Yeshua\nd* didn’t answer any further.
\s1 Pilate agrees to execute an innocent man
\r (Yhn 18:39–19:16; Mat. 27:15-26; Luke 23:13-25)
\p
\v 6 Now at time of the Jewish Passover, Pilate would normally pardon one prisoner for them and release him.
\v 7 There was another prisoner at the time named Barabbas who was an activist accused of murder.
\v 8 By now, the crowd had arrived and asked Pilate to release a prisoner as usual at Passover,
\v 9 so he asked them, “Do you want me to release the King of the Jews for you?”
\v 10 (This was because Pilate was well aware that the chief priests had brought Yeshua because they were jealous of his \add popularity\add*.)
\v 11 But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to start saying that it was Barabbas that they wanted released,
\v 12 so Pilate asked again, “Then what should I do with this man that you call the King of the Jews?”
\p
\v 13 The crowd yelled back, “Execute him on a pole.”
\p
\v 14 “What has he even done wrong?” Pilate demanded.
\p But they just yelled louder, “Execute him on a pole!”
\p
\v 15 Now Pilate wanted to placate the crowd, so he had Barabbas released while he had \nd Yeshua\nd* flogged and then handed over to the execution squad.
\s1 The battalion plays with their mock ‘king’
\r (Yhn 19:2-3; Mat. 27:27-31)
\p
\v 16 So the soldiers led Yeshua inside the palace that was the governor’s residence, and called in the rest of the battalion.
\v 17 They \add mocked Yeshua\add* by dressing him in a kingly robe, and after someone twisted some thorns together into a mock crown, they pressed it onto his head,
\v 18 and began saluting him, “Greetings, king of the Jews.”
\v 19 They took turns whacking his head with a stick and spitting on him, while others knelt down in front of him and pretended to be bowing to him.
\v 20 After they’d finished having fun mocking him, they took the purple robe off him, and put his own robe back on him. Then they led him outside towards the execution spot.
\s1 Yeshua is publicly executed along with thieves
\r (Yhn 19:17-27; Mat. 27:32-44; Luke 23:26-43)
\p
\v 21 \x + \xo 15:21: \xt Rom 16:13.\x*As they walked out of the city, they came across a man coming in from the country. He was Simon from Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, and the soldiers forced him to carry the execution pole,
\v 22 and so they all arrived at Golgotha (which means ‘Place of the skull’).
\v 23 There the soldiers went to give some spiced wine to Yeshua, but he declined it.
\v 24 \x + \xo 15:24: \xt Psa 22:18.\x*So they carried out the execution, taking Yeshua’s clothes and drawing straws to see who would get what.
\v 25 By now it was around 9am, and they affixed Yeshua to the pole.
\v 26 The charge had been written out and attached \add at the top\add*: “The king of the Jews.”
\v 27 That morning, two thieves were also executed there—one on each side of Yeshua.

\v 29 \x + \xo 15:29: a \xt Psa 22:7; 109:25; \xo b \xt Yhn 2:19; Mrk 14:58.\x*As people passed by on the path, they insulted Yeshua, shaking their heads and shouting, “Hoy there! You who reckoned you could demolish the temple and rebuild it in three days,
\v 30 come down from that pole and save yourself.”
\p
\v 31 Similarly the chief priests and the religious teachers laughed together and mocked, “He did miracles for others, but he can’t even save himself.
\v 32 The so-called ‘\nd chosen\nd* one’ or ‘king of Israel’. Now, if he’d just come down from there, then we’d be able to believe him.”
\p Even the other two being executed with him were deriding him.
\s1 Yeshua breathes his last
\r (Yhn 19:28-30; Mat. 27:45-56; Luke 23:44-49)
\p
\v 33 At noon, it got dark everywhere, until around 3pm,
\v 34 \x + \xo 15:34: \xt Psa 22:1.\x*when \nd Yeshua\nd* shouted loudly, “\wj My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?\wj*”
\p
\v 35 Some of the people standing nearby thought he was calling the prophet Eliyyah \add (Elijah)\add*.
\v 36 \x + \xo 15:36: \xt Psa 69:21.\x*One of them ran, and soaked a sponge in some sour wine, then put it on a stick and held it up for Yeshua to drink, saying, “Hang on. Let’s see if Eliyyah does come to get him down.”
\p
\v 37 But just then \nd Yeshua\nd* uttered a loud cry and exhaled his last breath.
\p
\v 38 \x + \xo 15:38: \xt Exo 26:31-33.\x*(Back in the temple, the curtain tore down the middle from the top to the bottom.)
\v 39 When Yeshua died, the Roman centurion who had been standing back watching everything said, “This man was definitely God’s son.”
\p
\v 40 \x + \xo 15:40-41: \xt Luk 8:2-3.\x*Further back, there was also a group of women observing everything. These included Maria from Magdala, Maria the mother of young Yacob and Yoses, and Salome,
\v 41 and others who had followed Yeshua around Galilee and helped look after him, along with many others who had come down with him to Yerushalem.
\s1 Yosef boldly lays the body in a burial chamber
\r (Yhn 19:38-42; Mat. 27:57-61; Luke 23:50-56)
\p
\v 42 As evening came, it was now the Preparation Day, i.e., the day before the Rest Day.
\v 43 Yosef (who’d come from the city of Arimathea and one who was waiting for the coming of God’s kingdom), a prominent council member, steeled himself up and went in to see the governor to get permission to transfer \nd Yeshua’s\nd* body.
\v 44 Governor Pilate didn’t think he’d be dead yet, so he called an army commander to find out if Yeshua had indeed died.
\v 45 As soon as he found out, he gave Yosef permission,
\v 46 so Yosef \add and his companions\add* went and bought some linen burial cloth and then, removing Yeshua’s body from the pole, wrapped it in the cloth and placed it in a burial chamber that had been chiselled into a rockface. Then they rolled a rock across the opening.
\v 47 Others were watching and noted where the body had been laid, including Maria from Magdala and Maria who was Yoses’ mother.

\s1 The massive shock at the burial chamber
\r (Yhn 20:1-10; Mat. 28:1-8; Luke 24:1-12)
\p
\v 1 After the Rest Day was over, Maria from Magdala and Maria the mother of Yacob and Salome, went and bought some traditional burial spices that evening to take to the burial chamber and place with the body.
\v 2 Then very early on Sunday morning they went to the chamber, arriving just as the sun was rising.
\v 3 But they realised that they didn’t have anyone with them to roll the rock away that was covering the entrance.
\v 4 However, when they looked they saw that the very large rock had already been rolled away.
\v 5 So they went on into the burial chamber and were totally stunned to find a young man dressed in white, sitting in there on the side.
\p
\v 6 He assured them, “Don’t be surprised. I know you’re looking for \nd Yeshua\nd* from \nd Nazareth\nd*, the one who was executed on a pole. But see there where his body was—he’s not there because he came back to life.
\v 7 \x + \xo 16:7: \xt Mat 26:32; Mrk 14:28.\x*So you three should go and tell his apprentices, and Peter in particular, that he’s going to go up ahead of them to Galilee and you’ll all see him up there, just as he already told you.”
\p
\v 8 So they left the chamber and took off running, still stunned and shaking and too scared to stop and to talk to anyone.
\rem It’s not certain whether or not the following longer ending of this document was actually penned by Mark, or whether it was appended slightly later. Expert scholars are divided on this, and hence it’s included here for your consideration:
\s1 \add The others don’t believe that Maria saw Yeshua\add*
\r (Yhn 20:11-18; Mat. 28:9-10)
\p
\v 9 \add After coming back to life early on Sunday morning, Yeshua appeared first to Maria from Magdala. (She was the one that he had once commanded seven demons to leave.)\add*
\v 10 \add After leaving him, she went and told his followers who were mourning and weeping at his loss.\add*
\v 11 \add But when she told them that he is alive again and that she’d seen him, they simply didn’t believe her.\add*
\s1 \add Yeshua appears to two of his followers\add*
\r (Luke 24:13-35)
\p
\v 12 \add Later on, Yeshua appeared in a different form to two of his followers on the path as they left Yerushalem and headed out to the countryside,\add*
\v 13 \add but when they hurried back and told the others, no one believed them.\add*
\s1 \add Yeshua appears to his apprentices and instructs them\add*
\r (Yhn 20:19-23; Mat. 28:16-20; Luke 24:36-49; Acts 1:6-8)
\p
\v 14 \add Later again when the eleven apprentices were sitting around eating, Yeshua appeared in the room and scolded them for not believing and for being so stubborn when they hadn’t believed others who had told them that he’d come back from the dead.\add*
\v 15 \add Then he instructed them, “\+wj Travel around all the world\x + \xo 16:15: \xt Acts 1:8.\x* and tell the good message to everyone.\+wj*\add*
\v 16 \add \+wj Anyone who believes and gets immersed in water will be saved, however, those who refuse to believe will be condemned to death.\+wj*\add*
\v 17 \add \+wj Those who believe will be able to do miracles: they’ll be able to use my authority to command demons to leave and to speak new languages,\+wj*\add*
\v 18 \add \+wj and they’ll be able to pick up snakes. If they drink anything poisonous, it won’t hurt them, and they will place their hands on people and make them better.\+wj*”\add*
\s1 \add Yeshua is lifted up to heaven\add*
\r (Luke 24:50-53; Acts 1:9-11)
\p
\v 19 \add When Yeshua had finished speaking, he was lifted up into heaven and seated in the honoured place\x + \xo 16:19: \xt Acts 1:9-11.\x* next to God.\add*
\v 20 \add Then his followers went around preaching everywhere, and God worked through them and so they were able to confirm the truth of their preaching by doing miracles.\add*
