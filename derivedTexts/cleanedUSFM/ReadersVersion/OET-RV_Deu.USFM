\is1 Introduction
\ip The Greek word ‘Deuteronomy’ means ‘Second law’, because some aspects of God’s instructions in the previous accounts are repeated again in this one, noticeably the Ten Commandments. Hebrew readers call this document ‘Devārim’ which is the second word in the Hebrew text and means ‘Words’ or ‘Things’. Some European and other translations call it ‘The fifth book of Mosheh/Moses’.
\ip This document contains a series of addresses that Mosheh (commonly known in English as Moses) made to the descendants of Yisrael/Israel while they were in the Moav region on the eastern side of the Yarden/Jordan river. They had stopped there for quite a long time after their travelling through the wilderness, and it would soon be time for them to cross the river and enter the ‘promised land’ of Kanaan/Canaan.
\ip Some of the more important points made in this document include: 1. Mosheh’s summary of the history of the Israelis over the previous forty year, and how he requested them to remain loyal and obedient to Yahweh. 2. Mosheh’s retelling of the ‘Ten commands’ and his explanation of the first commands, ensuring that Yisrael’s descendants knew that it was vital to continue serving Yahweh. This also includes the various rules to be obey in Kanaan. 3. Mosheh’s interpretation of the peoples agreement with Yahweh is retold here, and his encouragement to the people to continue to obey that agreement. 4. The selection of Yehoshua/Joshua as the new leader for God’s chosen people group, Mosheh’s song about the joy of serving Yahweh and the blessings for those who obey. Mosheh’s death in Moav is also retold here.
\ip The best known segment of this document is Yahweh’s blessing and cursing of his chosen people depending on the path that they decide to take. If the Israelis would chose to follow Yahweh’s instructions, there was a large blessing to be receive, but equally a terrifying curse should they fail to acknowledge what God had done for them.
\ip The most important verses here are 6:4-6, quoted by Yeshua as being the greatest of all commands: You should love your god Yahweh with your whole mind, your entire being, and all your strength.

\s1 Mosheh’s first set of instructions
\p
\v 1 These are the messages that Mosheh \add (Moses)\add* spoke to Yisrael \add (Israel)\add* \add back when they were\add* in the wilderness \add on the eastern side\add* of the Yarden \add (Jordan) river\add*, in the desert plain opposite Suf between Paran and Tofel, Lavan, Hatserot, and Di-Zahav.
\v 2 (It takes eleven days \add to walk\add* from Horev \add (Mt. Sinai)\add* to Kadesh-Barnea via Mt. Seir.)
\v 3 Forty years \add after the Israelis had left Egypt\add* Mosheh \add passed on\add* to \add them\add* everything that Yahweh had instructed him
\v 4 after he’d defeated the Amorite King Sihon who lived at Heshbon, and Bashan King Og who lived at Ashtarot in Edrei.\x + \xo 1:4: \xt Num 21:21-35.\x*
\v 5 On the eastern side of the Yarden \add river\add* in the Moav \add (Moab)\add* region, Mosheh \add began\add* explaining those instructions, saying,
\s2 The removal of Yisrael’s descendants from Sinai
\p
\v 6 “Our God Yahweh spoke to us at Horev, saying: You’ve \add camped\add* here \add long enough\add* at this mountain.
\v 7 \add Now,\add* \add pack up\add* and travel to the Amorite hill country and \add the surrounding areas\add* and the river plain, the lowlands and the southern wilderness, the coastal plain, all of Canaan, and Lebanon as far \add north-east\add* as the Euphrates river.
\v 8 Listen, that \add area of\add* land \add ahead of you\add*, I’ve given to you. Go \add ahead\add* and take possession that land that Yahweh promised to your ancestors Avraham \add (Abraham)\add*, Yitshak \add (Isaac)\add*, and Yakov \add (Jacob)\add*. \add He promised\add* to give it to them and to their descendants.”
\s2 Mosheh appoints leaders
\r (Exo. 18:13-27)
\p
\v 9 Then Mosheh said, “I told you at that time that I wasn’t able to \add govern\add* all of you by myself
\v 10 \add because\add* your god Yahweh has multiplied you, and wow, \add now\add* you’re as numerous as the stars in the sky.
\v 11 May your ancestors’ god Yahweh increase you all a thousand times \add more\add* and bless you all as he’s promised
\v 12 \add but\add* how could I \add possibly\add* bear all your loads and burdens and disputes by myself?
\v 13 \add So\add* nominate some men from your tribes who I can appoint as your leaders—\add men\add* who are sensible and wise, and respected \add by the people\add*,
\v 14 and \add your parents\add* \add agreed with that suggestion\add*.
\v 15 \add So\add* I took those wise, respected men and appointed them to be your leaders—leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties, and of tens. \add I also appointed some\add* as your tribal officials.
\v 16 Then I instructed your \add new\add* leaders telling them to \add listen carefully\add* to \add both sides of\add* \add disputes\add* and \add make fair and honest judgements\add* \add in conflicts involving\add* \add either Israelis or\add* foreigners.
\v 17 \add Don’t show partiality when you’re making a judgement—treat important people just the same as the others\add*. \add Don’t worry about what people will think because fair judgement is a godly activity\add*. And if any matter is too difficult, bring it to me \add for a decision\add*.
\v 18 I also gave you all other instructions at that time.
\s2 The spies
\r (Num. 13:1-33)
\p
\v 19 “Then we left Horev \add (Mt. Sinai)\add* and went through that wide and dangerous wilderness that you saw on the way to the Amorite hill country as our god Yahweh had instructed us, \add eventually\add* arriving at Kadesh-Barnea.
\v 20 Then I told you all, ‘You’ve all come to the Amorite hill country, which our god Yahweh is giving us.
\v 21 Look, your god Yahweh has given you\f + \fr 1:21 \ft The you\+bd (pl)\+bd* in the previous verse has switched to you\+bd (sg)\+bd* here.\f* the land \add that’s in front of you\add*, \add so\add* go ahead and take possession of it as Yahweh, your ancestors’ god has told you. Don’t be afraid and don’t be discouraged.’
\v 22 Then you all approached me and \add suggested\add*, ‘\add We should send some men ahead of us to scout out the place\add*, and they can return and tell us the \add best way to get inside those\add* cities.’
\v 23 \add That sounded good to me, so I took one man from each of the twelve tribes\add*
\v 24 and they went up into the hill country as far as the Eshkol valley, and the scouted it \add out\add*.
\v 25 They \add picked\add* some fruit from \add there\add* and brought it \add back\add* to us, and \add reported\add* that the land that our god Yahweh is giving us was \add very\add* good.
\p
\v 26 “But \add your parents\add* were unwilling to \add proceed\add* and rebelled against your god Yahweh’s \add command\add*.\x + \xo 1:26: \xt Deu 9:23; Heb 3:16.\x*
\v 27 So you all grumbled in your tents, saying that it was because Yahweh hated us that he brought us out of Egypt to hand us over to the Amorites to be destroyed.
\v 28 \add You said\add* that you all didn’t want to enter because the people \add were so tall and strong\add* and their cities were \add fortified and powerful\add* with very high walls around them.
\p
\v 29 “Then I told \add your parents\add*, ‘Don’t be terrified or afraid of them.
\v 30 Your god Yahweh \add who goes ahead of you\add*, he’ll fight for you just like everything \add you saw\add* him do in Egypt
\v 31 and in the wilderness, where you saw how your god Yahweh carried you like a \add father\add* carries his son—getting you through \add that difficult region\add* until you all \add eventually\add* arrived here.’\x + \xo 1:31: \xt Acts 13:18.\x*
\v 32 \add However,\add* you all didn’t believe your god Yahweh\x + \xo 1:32: \xt Heb 3:19.\x*
\v 33 \add who had gone ahead\add* of you to find a \add good\add* place for you all to make your camp—using fire at night to show you all the way, and cloud in the daytime.
\s2 Yisrael’s punishment
\r (Num. 14:20-45)
\p
\v 34 “Yahweh heard \add those complaints\add* and got angry and made this promise,\x + \xo 1:34-35: \xt Heb 3:18.\x*
\v 35 ‘None of the men of this evil generation will \add get to enter\add* the good land that I promised to give to your ancestors
\v 36 apart from Yefunneh’s son Kalev \add (Caleb)\add*—he \add can enter\add* it and I’ll give him and his sons the land \add that he scouted out\add* because he \add followed Yahweh whole-heartedly\add*.’
\v 37 Yahweh was \add also\add* angry at me because of you all, \add and\add* told me that I also wouldn’t \add be able to enter\add*,
\v 38 but that Nun’s son Yehoshua who was standing there in front of me, \add would be the one to lead\add* Yisrael to possess the land.
\p
\v 39 “Your children that you \add thought would be taken captive\add*, and your young sons who don’t \add yet\add* know right from wrong, they’ll \add be the ones to\add* enter \add the land\add*, and I’ll give it to them, and \add it’ll become theirs\add*.
\v 40 \add But\add* you yourselves need to turn around and go back into the wilderness \add in the direction of\add* the Red Sea.
\p
\v 41 “\add but they\add* all answered and \add admitted\add*, ‘\add Yes,\add* we’ve sinned against Yahweh, \add but now we’ll fix that by\add* going in to fight and do everything that our god Yahweh has commanded us.’ \add So\add* every man strapped on his weapons—\add now thinking it would be easy to take over\add* the hill country.
\p
\v 42 “\add But\add* Yahweh told me to \add warn\add* them not to go ahead and fight because he wouldn’t help them, and \add so\add* they’d \add end up\add* being defeated by their enemies if they proceeded.
\v 43 \add So\add* I told \add your parents\add* that, but they wouldn’t listen—they rebelled against Yahweh and arrogantly \add marched\add* up into the hill country
\v 44 \add where\add* the Amorites who lived there came out against them, and chased them like bees and made \add the warriors\add* scatter in Seir as far as Haremah.
\v 45 \add So your parents\add* returned and wept \add in front\add* of Yahweh, but he didn’t \add pay any attention to them\add*.
\v 46 \add So that’s why we\add* stayed at Kadesh-Barnea \add for as long as we all did\add*.
\c 2
\s1 Yisrael’s wanderings in the wilderness
\p
\v 1 “Then we turned and went \add back\add* into the wilderness towards the Red Sea as Yahweh had told us to do, and we \add spent a long time wandering\add* around Mt. Seir.\x + \xo 2:1: \xt Num 21:4.\x*
\p
\v 2 “Then Yahweh told me,
\v 3 ‘You’ve all been wandering around this hilly area for long enough—\add now\add* turn and go towards the north
\v 4 and tell the people, “You’ll all be crossing the border into Seir where your relatives, Esau’s descendants, live. They’ll be afraid of you \add but you’ll all need to stay very alert\add*.\x + \xo 2:4: \xt Gen 36:8.\x*
\v 5 \add Don’t attack\add* them because I won’t give you any of their land—\add not even a footprint size piece\add* because I’ve given Mt. Seir to Esau as \add their\add* inheritance.
\v 6 \add Any food or drink you get from them must be paid for with cash\add*
\v 7 because your god Yahweh has blessed all of your labour—he’s \add always\add* \add been aware of your travel\add* through that vast wilderness. Your god Yahweh has \add helped\add* you for those forty years \add so\add* you’ve all \add had everything you need\add*.” ’
\p
\v 8 “\add So\add* we passed by our relatives, Esau’s descendants who live in Seir. We travelled along the Yarden valley plain from Eilat and Estyon-Gever, then \add north\add* through the Moav wilderness.
\v 9 Then Yahweh told me, ‘\add Don’t aggravate\add* Moav, and \add don’t attack\add* them, because I won’t give you \add any of their land\add* because I’ve given Ar to the sons of Lot, as a possession.’ ”\x + \xo 2:9: \xt Gen 19:37.\x*
\s1 The tribes near Kanaan
\p
\v 10 (The Emites had lived their previously—there were many of them, and they were tall and strong like the Anakites.
\v 11 \add People also call both\add* the Emites and the Anakites, Refa’ites but the people of Moav call them Emites.
\v 12 The Horites had previously lived in Seir, \add but\add* Esau’s descendants \add had killed them and taken over\add* their land, just like the Israelis did \add later\add* in the land that Yahweh had given them to possess.)
\p
\v 13 “\add Then we crossed the Zered brook as Yahweh had told us to do\add*.
\v 14 \add It had been\add* thirty-eight years since we first left Kadesh-Barnea until we cross the Zered brook, \add once\add* that generation of \add warriors\add* had \add died off\add*, just as Yahweh had \add told\add* them.\x + \xo 2:14: \xt Num 14:28-35.\x*
\v 15 \add What’s more, Yahweh had opposed them, so he’d caused them to die\add*.
\p
\v 16 “\add After\add* all the \add enlistment-aged\add* men had died,
\v 17 Yahweh told me,
\v 18 ‘Today you must \add travel through the Moav region\add*, \add near\add* Ar,
\v 19 and \add when\add* you approach the Ammonite \add region\add*, don’t irritate or fight them because I won’t give you any of \add their\add* land because I’ve given it to Lot’s descendants as a possession.’ ”\x + \xo 2:19: \xt Gen 19:38.\x*
\p
\v 20 (Also, it’s regarded as the land of the Refa’ites, who the Ammonites call the Zamzummites, who lived there in the past.
\v 21 \add They were\add* as numerous, and as tall and strong as the Anakites, \add but\add* Yahweh destroyed them \add in advance\add* of \add the Anakites\add* who then dispossessed them and lived in their place.
\v 22 He had done \add the same thing\add* for Esau’s descendants who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites \add ahead of them\add*, and they \add took over their land\add* and \add still\add* live there to this day.
\v 23 \add Also\add* the Avvites who lived in villages as far \add south\add* as Azzah \add (Gaza)\add* were destroyed by the Kaftorites who came from \add Crete\add*, and then lived in their place.)
\p
\v 24 “\add Yahweh had told us,\add* ‘\add Get ready\add* \add now\add* and go through the Arnon river valley. I’ll \add help you defeat\add* the Amorite King Sihon from Heshbon. \add Attack him\add* and begin to \add take over\add* his land.
\v 25 \add Beginning today\add*, I’ll \add make everyone, everywhere afraid\add* of you. \add Everyone who hears about you will be terrified and keep their distance from you\add*.’
\s1 Defeat of King Sihon
\r (Num. 21:21-30)
\p
\v 26 “Then from the Kedemot wilderness, I sent messengers to King Sihon at Heshbon with \add an offer\add* of peace,
\v 27 ‘\add Please let us travel through your country. We’ll stay on the road\add*
\v 28 \add if you’d be able to just sell us some\add* food and water, then we could just walk right through
\v 29 until we cross the Yarden river into the land that our god Yahweh is giving us. Easu’s descendants at Seir \add allowed us through\add*, as did the Moabites at Ar.’
\p
\v 30 “\add However,\add* Heshbon’s King Sihon wouldn’t let us go through \add his country\add* because your god Yahweh had hardened his spirit and \add made him stubborn\add* so that you \add could take his land\add*, \add which we still have\add* to this day.
\p
\v 31 “Yahweh told me, ‘Listen, I’ve begun to give Sihon and his land to you, \add so enter it and take it\add*.
\v 32 Then \add King\add* Sihon and all his \add warriors\add* came out against us at Yahats,
\v 33 \add but\add* our god Yahweh \add helped us to defeat him, and we killed\add* Sihon and his son, and all his people.
\v 34 We captured all his cities at that time, and completely destroyed men, women and children in every city, leaving no survivors.
\v 35 Only the cattle were taken as plunder for ourselves, along with \add the goods\add* in the cities we captured.
\v 36 Our god Yahweh \add helped us to capture\add* \add all their towns\add* from Aroer \add in the south\add* at the edge of the Arnon River valley, to the Gilead region \add in the north\add*—none of their city \add walls\add* were too high for us.
\v 37 \add However,\add* you didn’t \add go near the Ammonite region\add*, the Yabok river area, the hill country towns, or any other place where our god Yahweh told us not to go.
\c 3
\s1 The defeat of Bashan’s King Og
\r (Num. 21:31-35)
\p
\v 1 “Then we turned and went towards the Bashan \add region\add* \add but\add* King Og came out with all his \add warriors\add* to battle against us at Edrei,
\v 2 \add but\add* Yahweh told me, ‘Don’t be afraid of him, because I’ve given him and all his people and his land \add over to you\add*, and you’ll do the same to him that you did to the Amorite King Sihon who lived at Heshbon.’
\p
\v 3 “\add So\add* our god Yahweh also \add helped us defeat\add* Bashan’s King Og and all his people, and we \add killed\add* them all leaving no survivors.
\v 4 We captured \add all\add* sixty of King Og’s cities in the Argov region of Bashan,
\v 5 \add even though\add* they were all fortified with high walls and gates with bars. In addition, there were many rural villages.
\v 6 We completely destroyed them like we’d done to Heshbon’s King Sihon—men, women, and children,
\v 7 but we plundered all the cattle and the spoil from the cities for ourselves.
\p
\v 8 \add So\add* at that time, we took the land from two of the Amorite kings \add across on the eastern side\add* of the Yarden, from the Arnon River \add in the south, up\add* to Mt. Hermon \add in the north\add*
\v 9 (called Mt. Shiryon by the Sidonians, and Mt. Senir by the Amorites).
\v 10 \add We captured\add* all the cities on the plain and all of the Gilead region, as well as Bashan as far \add east as\add* Salekah and Edrei cities, which also belonged to Og’s kingdom.”
\v 11 (Bashan’s King Og \add was the last king who was a descendant\add* of the Refaites. His bed (in Rabbah in the Ammonite region) was made out of iron and was \add four metres\add* long and \add two metres\add* wide.)
\s1 Land division on the eastern side
\r (Num. 32:1-42)
\p
\v 12 “\add So\add* we \add captured\add* that land at that time—from Aroer by the Arnon river, and half of the hill country of Gilead including its cities. I \add allocated\add* \add those areas\add* to the \add tribes of Reuven and Gad\add*.
\v 13 Then the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan which had been Og’s kingdom, I \add allocated\add* to half of the tribe of Menashsheh.”
\p (That whole area is called the land of the Refaites.
\v 14 Menashsheh’s son Yair had \add captured\add* the Argov region as far as the borders with the Geshurites and Maacatites, \add renaming\add* Bashan to Havvot-Yair \add as it’s still called\add* to this day.)
\p
\v 15 “Then I \add allocated\add* Gilead to Makir \add (a clan descended from Menashsheh)\add*,
\v 16 and I gave \add the southern\add* part of Gilead to the \add tribes of\add* Reuven and Gad, \add extending from\add* the Arnon river (with the middle of it being the boundary) to the Yabbok river which borders against the Ammonites.
\v 17 The border extends from the plain along \add the east side of\add* the Yarden valley, from \add Lake\add* Kinneret \add in the north\add* to the Arabah lake (the Salt Sea \add or Dead Sea\add*) \add in the south\add* and to the slopes of Mt. Pisgah on the east.
\p
\v 18 “Then at that time, I commanded you saying, ‘Your god Yahweh has given this land to you to possess it, \add however\add* \add your brave warriors\add* must cross over \add with the other Israeli tribes\add* \add to help them conquer the western lands\add*.\x + \xo 3:18-20: \xt Josh 1:12-15.\x*
\v 19 \add Leave\add* your wives and children and cattle (yes, I know you have many cattle) \add back here\add* in the cities that I’ve given you
\v 20 until Yahweh gives \add peace\add* to your brother tribes like you have \add here\add*. \add Once\add* they’ve taken possession of the land that your god Yahweh is given them across the river, then you’ll all be able to return her to your own inheritance that I’ve \add allocated\add* to you.’
\p
\v 21 “I \add also\add* instructed Yehoshua \add (Joshua)\add* at that time, saying, ‘\add You’ve\add* seen everything that your god Yahweh has done to those two kings. Yahweh will do \add similar things\add* to all the kingdoms that you’ll be passing through \add over\add* there.
\v 22 Don’t be afraid of them, because your god Yahweh \add will be the one\add* fighting for you all.
\s1 Mosheh is not permitted to enter Kanaan
\p
\v 23 “At that time, I \add pleaded\add* with Yahweh,
\v 24 ‘My master Yahweh, you’ve begun to show your servant your greatness and your \add power\add*. What \add other\add* god in heaven or on earth is there that does works as \add great and powerful as what you’ve done\add*?
\v 25 Please let me cross the Yarden river and see the good land that’s \add on the other side\add*—that good hill country, and the Lebanon \add region\add*.’
\p
\v 26 “\add But\add* Yahweh was angry at me because of \add what your parents had done\add*, and he wouldn’t listen to me. \add Instead,\add* Yahweh told me, ‘Enough from you—don’t talk to me about that again!
\v 27 Go up to the top of Mt. Pisgah and \add look out\add* towards the west and the north and the south and the east. \add Yes,\add* look with your eyes, because you won’t be crossing this river.
\v 28 Instruct Yehoshua and encourage him and strengthen him, because \add he’s the one who’ll lead the\add* people across, and he’ll \add lead\add* them to inherit the land that you’ll see.’
\v 29 \add So\add* we remained in the \add Yarden river\add* valley opposite Beyt-Peor.

\s1 Mosheh encourages Yisrael to obey
\p
\v 1 “Now Yisrael, listen to the instructions and regulations that I’ll teach you so that you’ll all go and possess the land that Yahweh, the god of your ancestors, is giving you, and live there.
\v 2 Don’t add \add or subtract from what I tell\add* you, \add because you all need to follow\add* the instructions from your god Yahweh that I’m telling you.\x + \xo 4:2: \xt Rev 22:18-19.\x*
\v 3 You’ve all seen \add for yourselves\add* what your god Yahweh did at Beyt-Peor, when he destroyed all the men who \add worshipped\add* \add Baal\add* there.\x + \xo 4:3: \xt Num 25:1-9.\x*
\v 4 \add However,\add* all of you who \add faithfully continued to follow\add* your god Yahweh are alive \add here\add* today.
\p
\v 5 “\add Listen\add*, I’ve taught you all the instructions and regulations that my god Yahweh commanded me to, for you all to \add follow\add* in the land that you’re about to \add enter and occupy\add*.
\v 6 \add Follow them faithfully\add* because \add that will lead to\add* wisdom \add such that people in other countries will notice that\add* this great nation has wisdom and understanding.
\v 7 What \add other\add* great nation is there that has a god near to it like our god Yahweh is whenever we call \add out to him\add* \add for help\add*?
\v 8 \add Also,\add* what other nation has rules and regulations that are as \add sensible and fair\add* as these instructions that I’m giving to you all today?
\p
\v 9 “\add But\add* \add each of you must\add* take care to guard yourself and your \add values\add* in case you forget that you’ve seen and \add those past miracles\add* \add slip from your minds over the years to come\add*. \add Yes,\add* \add make sure that you teach them to your children and your grand-children\add*,
\v 10 \add including\add* the day when you stood \add in our god Yahweh’s presence\add* at \add Mt. Sinai\add* (Horev) when \add he\add* told me, ‘Assemble the people for me, and I’ll make \add it so they can\add* hear my words, so they’ll learn to \add honour and respect for their entire lifetimes,\add* and then teach it to their children.’
\p
\v 11 “\add So\add* you all approached the mountain and stood \add at its base\add* while it blazed with fire that went up into the \add atmosphere\add* \add even though\add* the mountain was covered with dark, gloomy clouds.\x + \xo 4:11-12: \xt Exo 19:16-18; Heb 12:18-19.\x*
\v 12 Then Yahweh spoke to you from the middle of the flames—you heard \add the voice even though you couldn’t see anyone\add*,
\v 13 and he \add revealed\add* to you the agreement that he \add demands\add* you keep: the ten commands that he wrote onto two stone tablets.\x + \xo 4:13: \xt Exo 31:18; 34:28; Deu 9:10.\x*
\v 14 At that time, Yahweh told me to teach you all the instructions and regulations so you’d be able to \add put them into practice\add* in the land that you’re \add about to enter and occupy\add*.\x + \xo 4:14: \xt Exo 21:1.\x*

\v 15 \add Now remembering that\add* you didn’t see any form at \add Mt. Sinai\add* (Horev) when Yahweh spoke to you all from the middle of the fire,
\v 16 \add so don’t corrupt yourselves\add* by making an idol \add to be your god\add*—don’t make anything in the likeness of a man or a woman,\x + \xo 4:16: \xt Exo 20:4; Lev 26:1; Deu 5:8; 27:15.\x*
\v 17 or of any animal that’s on the earth or bird that flies in the sky,\x + \xo 4:17-18a: \xt Rom 1:23.\x*
\v 18 or any \add reptile\add* that creeps along the ground or any fish from the deep \add oceans\add*.
\v 19 Don’t look up to the sky and be \add tempted\add* to bow down to the sun or the moon or the stars and serve them—your god Yahweh made them \add to serve\add* every people group \add in the world\add*.
\v 20 Yahweh has brought you all out of the iron-smelting furnace of Egypt to be a people that would belong to him (as you are today),\x + \xo 4:20: \xt Exo 19:5; Deu 7:6; 14:2; 26:18; Tit 2:14; 1Pe 2:9.\x*
\v 21 \add but\add* then Yahweh got angry at me because of \add your parents\add* and determined that I would never enter the land that he’s giving to all of you.\x + \xo 4:21: \xt Num 20:12.\x*
\v 22 \add Instead,\add* I’ll die here in this place. I won’t cross the Yarden river, but you will, and then you’ll all take possession of that good land.
\v 23 Take \add great\add* care that you all don’t forget the agreement with your god Yahweh. Don’t make any idols for yourselves in the form of anything that your god Yahweh has ordered you all \add not to\add*,
\v 24 because your god Yahweh is a consuming fire—he’s a god who gets jealous.\x + \xo 4:24: \xt Heb 12:29.\x*
\p
\v 25 \add Even\add* after you’ve had children and \add grandchildren\add* and then grown old in the land, don’t make an idol in the form of anything, and don’t be corrupt or do evil \add things\add* that your god Yahweh \add dislikes and so which will make him\add* angry.
\v 26 \add If you do\add*, I call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against you all today, that you’d die \add over there\add* in the land that you’re crossing the river to possess. You wouldn’t live there very long, but \add instead would end up\add* getting destroyed.
\v 27 Then Yahweh would scatter \add the remainder\add* among the nations where \add you’d remain as a small minority\add*.\x + \xo 4:27-28: \xt Deu 28:36.\x*
\v 28 There you would \add be forced to\add* worship gods that humans have made out of wood or stone and which can’t see, hear, smell, or eat.
\v 29 From there you’ll search for your god Yahweh, and you’ll find him when you search for him with \add determination and total sincerity\add*.\x + \xo 4:29: \xt Jer 29:13.\x*
\v 30 \add It’s in the future when you end up in distress\add* \add there\add* that you’ll return to your god Yahweh and listen to \add what he tells\add* \add you\add*,
\v 31 because your god Yahweh is a merciful god. He won’t abandon you or destroy you, and he won’t forget what he promised to your ancestors.
\p
\v 32 Now, please, consider past times before you were alive, i.e., from when God first created people here on the earth. You could search \add all through human history and you wouldn’t find anything else as incredible\add* \add as what Yahweh has done for your ancestors\add*.
\v 33 \add Has any other people group\add* heard God talking from the middle of a fire like you have, and then lived \add to tell about it\add*?
\v 34 Or is their any other nation that God has attempted to take out from the middle of another nation, using miracles and war, and power and terrifying actions, like your god Yahweh did for you all when you were in Egypt?
\v 35 You were shown \add all that\add* so you’d know that Yahweh is \add the one and only\add* god.\x + \xo 4:35: \xt Mrk 12:32.\x*
\v 36 He allowed you to hear his voice from the skies to instruct you, and on earth you heard his words from the incredible fire that he \add showed\add* you.
\v 37 Because he loved your ancestors, he chose their \add descendants\add* \add as his people\add* and used his \add power and strength to lead\add* you out of Egypt
\v 38 \add and then\add* to drive out nations ahead of you that were greater and more powerful than you—bringing you here today so that you could occupy their land as your inheritance.
\v 39 So today you should acknowledge that Yahweh is god of the heavens above and the earth below, and there’s no \add other god\add*.
\v 40 Follow his instructions and \add obey\add* his regulations that I’m \add giving\add* you today so that \add everything\add* will go well for you and your descendants, and so that you’ll live a long time in the land that your god Yahweh is giving you \add as a permanent possession\add*.”
\s1 The refuge cities
\p
\v 41 Then Mosheh \add (Moses)\add* selected three cities on \add that eastern\add* side of the Yarden\x + \xo 4:41-43: \xt Josh 20:8-9.\x*
\v 42 \add so that anyone who accidentally killed another person\add* could flee to one of those cities and \add be safe\add*:
\v 43 Bezer in the wilderness for the \add tribe of Reuben\add*, Ramot in Gilead for the \add tribe of Gad\add*, and Golan in the Bashan region for the \add tribe of Manasseh\add*.
\s1 Giving the instructions
\p
\v 44 These are the instructions that Mosheh \add (Moses)\add* gave to the \add Israelis\add*,
\v 45 \add including\add* all the instructions, rules, and regulations that Mosheh had told them when they left Egypt,
\v 46 when they were in the valley \add east\add* of the Yarden \add River\add*. They were across from the town of Beyt-Peor, in the land that the Amorite King Sihon (who lived in Heshbon \add city\add*) had ruled. (Mosheh and the \add other\add* \add Israelis\add* had defeated them when they came out of Egypt.)
\v 47 They had taken possession of his land, as well as the land of Bashan’s King Og—the two Amorite kings from the \add eastern side\add* of the Yarden—
\v 48 from Aroer \add city in the south\add* along the edge of the Arnon valley, and as far north as Mt. Sion (\add normally\add* called Mt. Hermon)
\v 49 and the entire plain east of the Yarden River, \add extending\add* to the Sea of the Arabah \add (the Dead/Salt sea)\add* and \add east to\add* the slopes of Mt. Pisgah.
\c 5
\s1 The ten rules
\r (Exo. 20:1-17)
\p
\v 1 Then Mosheh \add (Moses)\add* \add summoned\add* all Yisrael and told them, “Yisrael, listen to the instructions and the regulations that I will speak in your ears today, and then you must learn them and be careful to follow them.
\v 2 Our god Yahweh made an agreement with us at Horev \add (Mt. Sinai)\add*.
\v 3 \add He\add* didn’t make that agreement with our ancestors, but with us \add ourselves\add*—those of us here today, \add i.e., with\add* \em living\em* people.
\v 4 Yahweh spoke to you from the middle of the fire—face to face with you all on that mountain.
\v 5 \add Well,\add* \add it was me who\add* stood between all of you and Yahweh at that time, to reveal Yahweh’s message to you, because you were afraid \add to approach\add* the fire, and you all didn’t go up the mountain. \add Yahweh\add* said:
\p
\v 6 ‘I am your god Yahweh who brought you all out of Egypt—from the slave-house \add there\add*.
\li1
\v 7 \add Don’t have any other god, other than me.\add*
\li1
\v 8 Don’t \add carve\add* any figure for yourself \add that looks like\add* anything in the sky or on the ground, or in the water below the ground.\x + \xo 5:8-9: \xt Lev 26:1; Deu 4:15-18; 27:15.\x*
\v 9 Don’t bow down to them or \add serve\add* them, because I, your god Yahweh, am a jealous god. I’ll \add punish the descendants\add* of those who hate me, even for three or four generations,\x + \xo 5:9-10: \xt Exo 34:6-7; Num 14:18; Deu 7:9-10.\x*
\v 10 \add but\add* showing loyal commitment to thousands \add of generations\add* of those who love me and obey my instructions.
\li1
\v 11 Don’t use the name of your god Yahweh idly, because \add I\add* won’t \add fail to punish people who do that\add*.
\li1
\v 12 Observe the Rest Day \add on Saturday\add* to sanctify it, as your god Yahweh commanded you.\x + \xo 5:12: \xt Exo 16:23-30; 31:12-14.\x*
\v 13 There’s six days for labouring and doing all your work,
\v 14 \add but\add* the seventh day is a rest day \add dedicated\add* to your god Yahweh. Don’t do any work on that day: not you or your children or your slaves, or \add using\add* any of your cattle, nor any foreigner living \add with you\add*—your slaves can rest like you.
\v 15 Remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and that your god Yahweh \add took action and used my power\add* to take you out of there. Therefore your god Yahweh commands you to keep the Rest Day.
\li1
\v 16 Honour your father and mother as your god Yahweh has commanded you, so that \add you’ll have a long life\add* and \add so that everything will go well in the country\add* that your god Yahweh is giving you.\x + \xo 5:16: a \xt Deu 27:16; Mat 15:4; 19:19; Mrk 7:10; 10:19; Luk 18:20; Eph 6:2; \xo b \xt Eph 6:3.\x*
\li1
\v 17 Don’t murder \add anyone\add*.
\li1
\v 18 Don’t commit adultery.
\li1
\v 19 Don’t steal \add anything\add*.
\li1
\v 20 Don’t \add tell lies in court about anyone\add*.
\li1
\v 21 Don’t covet your neighbour’s \add spouse\add*, or their house or land, or their slaves or livestock, or \add anything else that they own\add*.’\x + \xo 5:21: \xt Rom 7:7; 13:9.\x*
\p
\v 22 Yahweh spoke those words in a \add booming\add* voice from the middle of the fire, the cloud, and the gloom, to all your assembly on the mountain. \add That was all he said\add*, and he wrote \add those instructions\add* on two stone tablets and gave them to me.\x + \xo 5:22-27: \xt Heb 12:18-19.\x*
\s1 The people’s fear
\r (Exo. 20:18-21)
\p
\v 23 Then when you heard the voice \add coming out\add* from the darkness and the mountain was blazing with fire, then all the heads of your tribes and the elders approached me
\v 24 and said, “Listen, our god Yahweh \add demonstrated his greatness and power when we heard him speak\add* from the fire. Today, we’ve realised that God talks to people, and that they can stay alive.
\v 25 \add However,\add* we’re \add still\add* afraid that we’ll die—getting burnt up in that intense fire if we continue hearing our god Yahweh’s voice,
\v 26 because \add when has anybody else ever heard the voice of the living god speak to them from the middle of a blazing fire and they\add* \add still\add* lived?
\v 27 You \add Mosheh (Moses),\add* \add go\add* and listen to everything that our god Yahweh says, and tell us everything that he tells you, and we’ll listen \add to that\add* and obey it.”
\p
\v 28 Yahweh heard \add you all say that\add* to me, and told me, ‘I’ve heard what they said to you and it’s a good idea.
\v 29 \add If only they were sincere in saying that they’d honour me and always follow all my instructions so that everything would go well for them and their descendants forever\add*.
\v 30 Go and tell them to return to their tents,
\v 31 \add but\add* then come \add back up\add* here and I’ll \add give\add* you all the instructions and rules and regulations for you to teach them, \add so they can follow them\add* in the land that I’m giving them to take possession of.’
\p
\v 32 Make sure that you do everything that your god Yahweh has commanded—don’t \add deviate from any of them\add*.
\v 33 \add Follow all the instructions from\add* your god Yahweh, and then you’ll all live and \add things will go well\add* and you’ll all \add be able to occupy that land for a long time\add*.
\c 6
\s1 Always honour Yahweh
\p
\v 1 These are the instructions and rules and regulations that your god Yahweh ordered me to teach you all, to do in the land that you’re about to enter and occupy.
\v 2 \add He\add* wants you all to honour him, to follow all his instructions, and to keep his rules that I’m teaching you and your descendants so that your time \add on the land\add* will be prolonged.
\v 3 \add So,\add* listen Yisrael and \add follow\add* carefully so that it will go well for you and that you’ll \add increase in population\add* in that \add very fertile\add* land as your ancestors’ god, Yahweh, \add promised\add*.
\p
\v 4 Listen Yisrael: Yahweh \add alone\add* is our god\x + \xo 6:4: \xt Mrk 12:29.\x*
\v 5 and you should love your god Yahweh with \add your whole mind, your entire being\add*, and all your strength.\x + \xo 6:5: \xt Mat 22:37; Mrk 12:30; Luk 10:27.\x*
\v 6 \add Always be considering\add* these instructions that I’m \add giving\add* you today,\x + \xo 6:6-9: \xt Deu 11:18-20.\x*
\v 7 and diligently teach them to your children, and talk about them when you’re sitting at home and when you’re \add out walking\add*, when you lie down and when you get up.
\v 8 Your \add hands should always be applying them\add* and your \add minds should always be evaluating them\add*.
\v 9 \add Carve\add* them onto your doorposts at home, and on your \add city\add* gates.
\s1 Warnings against disobeying
\p
\v 10 Your god Yahweh promised your ancestors Abraham,\x + \xo 6:10: \xt Gen 12:7.\x* Yitshak,\x + \xo 6:10: \xt Gen 26:3.\x* and Yakov,\x + \xo 6:10: \xt Gen 28:13.\x* that he’d give you large, \add prosperous\add* cities that you didn’t have to build,
\v 11 houses full of every good thing that you didn’t have to collect, wells that you didn’t have to dig, and vineyards and olive groves that you didn’t have to plant. You’ll be able to eat and be satisfied,
\v 12 \add but\add* be sure to never forget that it was Yahweh who rescued you from slavery in Egypt.
\v 13 You must honour your god Yahweh and only serve him and only make promises using his name.\x + \xo 6:13: \xt Mat 4:10; Luk 4:8.\x*
\v 14 Don’t go \add trying to follow\add* other gods—the gods of the surrounding countries—
\v 15 because your god Yahweh who lives among you is a jealous god. You wouldn’t want \add him\add* to get angry with you and \add totally\add* destroy you.
\p
\v 16 Don’t test \add the patience of\add* your god Yahweh \add again\add* like you all did \add over water\add* at Massah.\x + \xo 6:16: a \xt Mat 4:7; Luk 4:12; \xo b \xt Exo 17:1-7.\x*
\v 17 Be sure to follow all \add his\add* instructions and rules and regulations that he’s \add given\add* you.
\v 18 Do what Yahweh says is right and good so that things will go well for you and you’ll be able to enter the good land that \add he\add* promised to your ancestors and take possession of it—
\v 19 driving out all your enemies from \add that land\add* just as Yahweh has said.
\p
\v 20 \add In the future\add* when your children ask you, ‘Why did our god Yahweh our god command us to obey all these rules and decrees?’
\v 21 then you can tell them, ‘We were Far-oh’s slaves in Egypt, \add but\add* Yahweh \add used his incredible power to get us out of there\add*.
\v 22 \add He\add* \add did many kinds of miracles that devastated that Egyptian king and his whole household\add*,
\v 23 then he took us out of there, so he could bring us here to give us the land that he’d promised to our ancestors.
\v 24 Yahweh ordered us to \add follow\add* all these instructions to \add demonstrate\add* that we honour him so that things will go well for us and \add he’ll protect our nation as he’s doing now\add*.
\v 25 Our god Yahweh \add will declare us to be innocent of wrong\add* if we obey everything that he’s instructed us.’
\c 7
\s1 Warning Yisrael’s descendants
\r (Exo. 34:11-16)
\p
\v 1 When your god Yahweh brings you into the land which you’re going to possess, he’ll drive out many people groups \add ahead of you\add*: the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and the Yevusites—seven \add societies\add* that are more powerful than yourselves.\x + \xo 7:1: \xt Acts 13:19.\x*
\v 2 When your god Yahweh \add enables you to defeat\add* them, you \add must kill them all\add*. \add You must make no agreement with them\add*, and you \add must not act mercifully toward\add* them.
\v 3 Don’t intermarry with them: don’t allow your daughters to marry their sons, or your sons to marry \add any of\add* their daughters
\v 4 because they’d turn your sons away from me, and they’d \add end up\add* serving other gods. Then Yahweh \add would become very angry\add* with you all and would quickly destroy you.
\v 5 \add What you all should do\add* to \add those people\add* is to break down their altars and smash their \add stone\add* pillars, cut their Asherah poles to pieces, and burn up their idols.\x + \xo 7:5: \xt Deu 12:3.\x*
\v 6 \add You must do that\add* because you’re a group of people who \add belong only to\add* your god Yahweh. \add He’s\add* chosen you \add from all the people groups in the world to be his own special people\add*.\x + \xo 7:6: \xt Exo 19:5; Deu 4:20; 14:2; 26:18; Tit 2:14; 1Pe 2:9.\x*
\p
\v 7 Yahweh loved you and chose you all, not because you were the \add most populous\add* nation (in fact, you were the smallest of all the nations),
\v 8 but because Yahweh loves you all and because he kept the promise that he’d made to your ancestors. Yahweh \add used his power to rescue\add* you all from the slavery \add imposed by\add* Egypt’s King Far-oh.
\v 9 \add So remember\add* that your god Yahweh is God—the faithful god who keeps agreements and \add displays\add* loyal commitment toward a thousand generations of those who love him and \add obey what he’s commanded\add*.\x + \xo 7:9-10: \xt Exo 20:5-6; 34:6-7; Num 14:18; Deu 5:9-10.\x*
\v 10 \add However,\add* to those who hate him, he won’t hesitate to pay them back with punishment and destruction.
\v 11 \add So\add* be sure to obey all the instructions, rules, and regulations that I’m giving you today.
\s1 Blessings for obedience
\r (Deu. 28:1-14)
\p
\v 12 \add If you pay attention to these instructions and always obey them\add*, then your god Yahweh will keep the agreement that he promised to your ancestors and \add continue to display his\add* loyal commitment to you,\x + \xo 7:12-16: \xt Deu 11:13-17.\x*
\v 13 and he will love you and bless you. \add He’ll grant you many children and make your farming productive\add*, \add producing\add* grain and \add grapes for\add* wine, and \add olive\add* oil. Your cattle and sheep and goats will multiply on the land that he promised your ancestors that he’d give you.
\v 14 You’ll be blessed \add more than any other people group\add*. \add All of you will be able to have children, and all of your livestock will produce offspring\add*.
\v 15 Yahweh will keep sickness away from you. All those horrible diseases that \add your ancestors\add* saw in Egypt won’t affect you, but \add instead\add* he’ll give them to those who hate you.
\v 16 You must destroy all the peoples that your god Yahweh \add gives you victory over\add*—\add don’t allow yourselves\add* to pity them, and don’t serve their gods because \add that would end up trapping you\add*.
\p
\v 17 Don’t \add tell yourselves that because those groups have many more people than you, that you won’t be able to drive them out\add*.
\v 18 You mustn’t be afraid of them, but rather you should think back to what your god Yahweh did to Far-oh and to all Egypt.
\v 19 \add Remember\add* the \add terrible plagues\add* that you saw, and the \add powerful miracles that your god Yahweh used\add* to bring you out. That’s what \add he’ll\add* do to the people groups that you’re \add still\add* afraid of now.
\v 20 What’s more, \add after that\add* your god Yahweh will send hornets against any who are left or in hiding, until \add they’re all destroyed\add*.
\v 21 Don’t be afraid of those people, because your god Yahweh will be with you. He’s a powerful god \add that people are in awe of\add*.
\v 22 \add He’ll\add* drive those people groups out bit by bit—\add don’t try to destroy them all at once or else the wild animals would multiply up and cause problems\add*.
\v 23 Your god Yahweh will \add enable you to defeat\add* \add those people groups\add* and \add cause them to panic\add* until they are destroyed.
\v 24 He’ll \add enable you to defeat\add* their kings and their names \add will be forgotten from history\add*. No one will be able to stand against you until you \add finally\add* destroy them.
\v 25 You must burn their idols in a fire—don’t \add be tempted to take any gold or silver decorations off them\add* in case you get trapped by it, because your god Yahweh \add hates every part of those idols\add*.
\v 26 Don’t take any of those disgusting \add idols\add* into your homes or \add you too might become a target for destruction\add*. You \add should hate and detest them because they’re destined for destruction\add*.
\c 8
\s1 The productive land to be possessed
\p
\v 1 You must consistently follow the instructions that I’m giving you today, so that you all can enter and occupy the land that Yahweh promised to your ancestors, and live \add there\add* and multiply.
\v 2 Remember the way that your god Yahweh led you these forty years in the wilderness in order to humble you—to test you to know whether or not \add you were sincere about obeying his instructions\add*.
\v 3 He humbled you \add by\add* making you hungry and feeding you \add some\add* stuff that neither you nor your ancestors had heard of, in order to teach you that people don’t just need food, but can only \add properly\add* live \add by following what Yahweh says\add*.\x + \xo 8:3: \xt Mat 4:4; Luk 4:4.\x*
\v 4 For the \add entire\add* forty years, your clothes didn’t wear out and your feet didn’t swell up \add from walking in the desert\add*.
\v 5 \add Don’t forget\add* that your god Yahweh disciplines you, just like a \add human father\add* disciplines his children.
\v 6 \add So\add* follow your god Yahweh’s instructions. \add Live how he’s told you\add*, and \add always\add* honour him
\v 7 because \add he’s\add* bringing you into a good land—a land with streams and fountains, and springs \add both\add* in the valleys and in the hills.
\v 8 \add It’s\add* a land with wheat and barley, grapevines and fig trees, pomegranates and olive trees, and honey—
\v 9 a land with \add plenty of food where\add* you won’t lack anything. \add There’s iron in the rocks, and copper in the hills\add*.
\v 10 You’ll eat and be full, and you’ll \add thank\add* your god Yahweh for the good land that he’s given you.
\s1 Warnings against forgetting Yahweh
\p
\v 11 \add Be careful not\add* to forget your god Yahweh by failing to follow his instructions and rules and regulations that I’m telling you today.\x + \xo 8:11-16: \xt Josh 13:5-6.\x*
\v 12 \add Watch out when\add* you eat and \add feel\add* satisfied, and you’ve built good houses and are living in them,
\v 13 and your herds and flocks have increased, and you’ve accumulated gold and silver, and everything you have has multiplied.
\v 14 \add That’s when it would be easy to\add* \add become proud\add* and forget your god Yahweh who brought you \add out of slavery in\add* Egypt.
\v 15 He led you through that vast, treacherous wilderness—\add the home of\add* \add poisonous\add* snakes and scorpions, and \add desert land without\add* water, \add then\add* he \add made water flow out of solid\add* rock.
\v 16 He fed you stuff in the wilderness that your ancestors had never heard of, so that he could humble you \add yet eventually cause you to prosper\add*
\v 17 without thinking to yourselves that your wealth came from your own strength and \add ability\add*.
\v 18 Remember that it’s your god Yahweh who gives you the strength to prosper, so that he can \add fulfill\add* his agreement that he promised to your ancestors, as \add he has\add* \add until now\add*.
\v 19 \add However,\add* if you \add end up\add* forgetting about your god Yahweh and \add start following\add* other gods and serving them and bowing down to them, I \add can assure\add* you that you’ll \add most definitely be destroyed\add*.
\v 20 If you don’t listen to \add what your god Yahweh says\add*, then you’ll be destroyed just like the other people groups that he’s destroyed ahead of you all.
\c 9
\s1 The reason for destruction of the land’s inhabitants
\p
\v 1 Listen Yisrael: Today you’ll cross the Yarden \add river\add* to \add drive out peoples\add* that are larger and more powerful than yourselves and who are protected in large, fortified cities \add with high walls\add*.
\v 2 The people \add themselves\add* are tall and strong. (Some of these are descendants of the Anakites, and you’ve heard people \add say that no one\add* can defeat the Anakites.)
\v 3 You \add need to be confident\add* that your god Yahweh will go \add ahead of you like a raging fire\add*—he’ll destroy them and subdue them ahead of you, then you can drive them out and quickly eliminate them as Yahweh has told you \add to do\add*.
\p
\v 4 After your god Yahweh has driven them out ahead of you, don’t go saying that it was thanks to your \add own\add* \add goodness and innocence\add*, because it’s because of the wickedness of those peoples that Yahweh is \add doing that\add*.
\v 5 \add Again,\add* it’s not because of your \add obedience or goodness\add* that you’re going in to occupy their land, but it’s because of the wickedness of those peoples that your god Yahweh will drive them out in front of you, and so that \add he\add* can \add fulfill\add* what he promised to your ancestors Abraham, Yitshak, and Yakov.
\v 6 \add Actually, you’re a very stubborn people, so be very clear\add*: it’s not because of your \add goodness and obedience\add* that your god Yahweh is giving you this good land.
\s1 The gold calf idol
\p
\v 7 \add Never forget\add* how you provoked your god Yahweh to get angry in the wilderness—you’ve been rebellious towards \add him\add* \add the whole time\add* from when you left Egypt until \add your arrival here\add*.
\v 8 \add Even\add* at Horev \add (Mt. Sinai)\add* you made Yahweh angry, \add in fact\add* he was angry enough to destroy you.
\v 9 When I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets containing Yahweh’s agreement with you, I stayed up on the mountain for forty days and nights \add without eating or drinking\add*.\x + \xo 9:9: \xt Exo 24:18.\x*
\v 10 Then Yahweh gave me the two stone tablets that had been written by God’s finger. They had the words spoken to you by Yahweh out from the fire on the mountain on the day of that assembly.
\v 11 \add Then finally\add* at the end of those forty days and nights, Yahweh gave me those two stone tablets \add with the agreement written on them\add*.
\p
\v 12 Then \add he\add* told me, ‘\add Now hurry and\add* go down quickly from here, because your people who you brought out from Egypt, have become corrupted. They \add didn’t take at all long to turn away from following my instructions\add*—they’ve \add already\add* made a metal \add idol\add* for themselves.’
\p
\v 13 \add Additionally,\add* Yahweh said to me, ‘I’ve \add noticed\add* that this \add group of people is very stubborn\add*.
\v 14 \add Move away\add* and I’ll destroy them \add so they’ll never be remembered again\add*, and I’ll make \add your descendants\add* into a more powerful and more prestigious nation than they ever were.’
\p
\v 15 \add So\add* I turned and headed back down the mountain that was still burning with fire, carrying the two tablets with the agreement \add written on them\add*.
\v 16 Then I looked, and wow, you \add certainly\add* had disobeyed your god Yahweh. You’d cast a metal calf. You’d turned so quickly from the instructions that Yahweh had given you.
\v 17 I grabbed those two \add stone\add* tablets and threw them to the ground—shattering them right in front of your eyes.
\v 18 Then I lay on the ground in front of Yahweh for forty days and nights without eating or drinking because of how you’d disobeyed Yahweh—doing evil things that provoked him into being angry.
\v 19 \add Yes,\add* I was afraid that \add in his terrible anger, Yahweh might destroy you, but\add* \add he\add* listened to me at that time.\x + \xo 9:19: \xt Heb 12:21.\x*
\v 20 Yahweh was angry enough \add to want\add* to destroy Aharon, \add but\add* I also interceded for him at that time.
\v 21 I took \add that symbol of\add* your \add disobedience\add*—that calf \add idol\add* that you all had made—and \add threw it into\add* the fire, then I crushed it and ground it into dust, and threw the dust into the mountain stream.
\p
\v 22 You all also provoked Yahweh to get angry at Taberah,\x + \xo 9:22: \xt Num 11:3.\x* at Massah,\x + \xo 9:22: \xt Exo 17:7.\x* and at Kivrot-Hattaavah.\x + \xo 9:22: \xt Num 11:34.\x*
\v 23 \add Also\add* when Yahweh sent you all from Kadesh-Barnea, saying, ‘Go in and take possession of the land that I’ve given to you,’ \add but\add* you rebelled against your god Yahweh’s words, and you didn’t believe him and didn’t \add do what he said\add*.\x + \xo 9:23: a \xt Num 13:17; \xo b \xt Deu 1:21; \xo c \xt Num 13:31; Deu 1:26; Heb 3:16.\x*
\v 24 You’ve all been rebellious against Yahweh since the day I knew you \add back in Egypt\add*.
\p
\v 25 \add So\add* I \add lay on the ground in Yahweh’s presence\add* for forty days and nights, because \add he\add* said he’d destroy you all,
\v 26 and I prayed, ‘My master Yahweh, these people belong to you. Don’t destroy them—they are people who you rescued and brought out of Egypt by \add using\add* your \add strength and power\add*.
\v 27 \add Don’t forget\add* \add what you promised\add* your servants Abraham, Yitshak, and Yakov. \add Overlook\add* the stubbornness, wickedness, and disobedience of these people
\v 28 so that the people \add of Egypt\add* where we were brought out from don’t say that you weren’t able to bring them to the land that you’d promised to give to them. \add They’ll say that\add* you took them into the desert to kill them there because you hated them.
\v 29 \add But\add* they are your people and your inheritance, who you brought out \add of Egypt\add* \add using your strength and power\add*.’
\c 10
\s1 The replacement stone tablets
\r (Exo. 34:1-10)
\p
\v 1 \add After that,\add* Yahweh told me, “Carve out two stone tablets like the first ones, and make a wooden chest \add to put them in\add*, then come up to me on the mountain.
\v 2 I’ll write the words onto the tablets that were on the first tablets that you broke, then you can put them into the box.”
\p
\v 3 \add So\add* I made a box from acacia wood, and I carved out two stone tablets like the first ones, and I went up the mountain \add carrying\add* the two tablets
\v 4 and he wrote the ten instructions on the tablets like the first \add time\add*—the same words that Yahweh had spoken to you from the fire on the mountain on the day of the assembly. Then \add he\add* gave me the tablets
\v 5 and I turned and went down the mountain. I put the tablets into the box that I’d made, just like Yahweh had told me to.
\p
\v 6 Then the \add Israelis\add* travelled from Beerot-Bene-Yaakan\f + \fr 10:6 \ft Rather than just transliterating this name as we’ve done, it would also be possible to translate it as ‘the wells of the sons of Yaakan’.\f* to Moserah\f + \fr 10:6 \ft The document known as ‘Numbers’ tells us that Aharon died on Mt. Hor, so presumably Moserah is in that same region.\f* where Aharon died. He was buried \add there\add*, and his son Eleazar replaced him as \add chief\add* priest.\x + \xo 10:6: \xt Num 20:28; 33:38.\x*
\v 7 From there they moved on to Gudgodah, then from \add there\add* onto Yotbatah—an area with many streams.
\v 8 At that time, Yahweh \add chose\add* the tribe of Levi to carry the box \add containing\add* Yahweh’s agreement, and to stand \add in Yahweh’s presence\add* to serve and \add worship\add* him, until this day.\x + \xo 10:8: \xt Num 3:5-8.\x*
\v 9 That’s why \add the Levites didn’t receive land in the same way as the other tribes\add* \add as\add* Yahweh told them that \add he\add* is their inheritance.
\v 10 I myself stayed up on the mountain for forty days and nights just like the first time. Yahweh listened to me that time as well, and \add said\add* that he wouldn’t destroy you.\x + \xo 10:10: \xt Exo 34:28.\x*
\v 11 Then Yahweh told me, “\add Continue your journey leading\add* the people to enter and occupy the land that I promised their ancestors that I’d give them.
\s1 The call to obedience
\p
\v 12 Now Yisrael, your god Yahweh expects you \add honour\add* \add him\add* and to \add follow his instructions\add* and to love him, and to serve \add him\add* with \add sincerity and with energy\add*—
\v 13 \add obeying\add* \add his\add* rules and regulations that I’m giving you today for the benefit of \add the country\add*.
\v 14 Listen, the highest heavens belong to your god Yahweh, as well as the earth and everything on it,
\v 15 \add yet\add* \add he\add* \add decided to show love\add* to your ancestors, and as their \add descendants\add*, he chose you all out from all the peoples as \add you know\add* to this day.
\v 16 You all must \add eradicate your rebelliousness\add* and \add stop being stubborn\add*,
\v 17 because your god Yahweh is god of gods and master of masters—the very powerful and awesome one who \add doesn’t judge by looks\add* and doesn’t accept bribes.\x + \xo 10:17: \xt 1Tim 6:15; Rev 17:14; 19:16; Acts 10:34; Rom 2:11; Gal 2:6; Eph 6:9.\x*
\v 18 He \add delivers\add* \add fair\add* judgements for the fatherless and for widows, and \add shows love\add* towards foreigners—giving them food and clothing,
\v 19 \add so\add* you all must \add show love\add* to foreigners \add too\add* because you all were foreigners when you were in Egypt.
\v 20 You must \add honour\add* your god Yahweh and serve him. \add Rely on\add* him and \add only\add* make promises \add with his authority\add*.
\v 21 He’s the one you should praise. He’s your god who’s done \add powerful miracles on your behalf\add* which you saw with your own eyes.
\v 22 When your ancestors went down to Egypt, there was only seventy of them, but now your god Yahweh \add has increased your population\add* like the stars in number.\x + \xo 10:22: a \xt Gen 46:27; \xo b \xt Gen 15:5; 22:17.\x*
\c 11
\s1 Remembering the miracles
\p
\v 1 You must love your god Yahweh and follow his instructions, rules, regulations, and commands \add from now on\add*.
\v 2 \add Of course that was you all and your parents\add* who \add experienced\add* your god Yahweh’s discipline and who saw his power and strength and \add the amazing miracles done on your behalf\add*—not your children.
\v 3 \add They didn’t see\add* his actions and the miracles done to King Far-oh and all his people right there in Egypt,\x + \xo 11:3: \xt Exo 7:8–12:13.\x*
\v 4 or what he did to the Egyptian army with its horses and chariots when he caused the Red Sea to flow over \add the top of them\add* as they chased you, and how Yahweh destroyed them and \add they’ve never recovered\add* to this day,\x + \xo 11:4: \xt Exo 14:28.\x*
\v 5 or \add how he helped\add* you all in the wilderness until you reached this place.
\v 6 \add Your children didn’t see\add* what \add Yahweh\add* did to Eliav’s sons Datan and Aviram (from the tribe of Rueven) when the ground opened \add up\add* and swallowed them, along with their houses and tents and \add all their families and animals\add* \add right in the middle of the encampment\add*\x + \xo 11:6: \xt Num 16:31-32.\x*
\v 7 because you all are the ones who \add actually\add* saw the amazing miracles that Yahweh did.
\s1 The promises and warnings
\p
\v 8 \add So then,\add* follow all the instructions that I’m \add giving\add* you all today so that you’ll all be strong to enter and take possession of the land \add once you cross the river\add*
\v 9 and so that you all might live \add for a long time\add* in that land which Yahweh promised to give them and their descendants—a land flowing with milk and honey
\v 10 because \add it’s\add* not like Egypt where \add your ancestors\add* came out from, where you planted seed and had to water \add the fields\add* \add by hand\add*.
\v 11 \add But\add* the land that you’re all about to enter over \add the river\add* has a terrain of hills and valleys, \add i.e.,\add* it drinks in the rain water.
\v 12 It’s a land that your god Yahweh \add cares about\add*—\add watching over\add* it from the beginning of each year to the end.
\p
\v 13 If you all listen to the instructions that I’m \add giving\add* you today, loving your god Yahweh and serving him with \add sincerity and with energy\add*,\x + \xo 11:13-17: \xt Lev 26:3-5; Deu 7:12-16; 28:1-14.\x*
\v 14 then \add he says that he’ll\add* give the land \add the seasonal early and late rains\add* \add so that you’ll be able to produce\add* grain, and new wine, and \add olive\add* oil.
\v 15 \add He’ll\add* provide grass in the countryside for your livestock, and you’ll eat and be satisfied.
\v 16 Guard yourselves to make sure that you’re not deceived and \add end up\add* turning around to serve other ‘gods’ and bow down to them,
\v 17 \add because\add* then Yahweh \add would become angry at\add* you and \add close\add* the skies so that there’d be no rain, and the land would \add stop producing\add*, and you’d all \add soon die\add* from off the good land that \add he’s\add* about to give you.
\p
\v 18 \add Memorise\add* these words of mine and \add constantly think about them\add*. Your \add hands should always be applying them\add* and your \add minds should always be evaluating them\add*.\x + \xo 11:18-20: \xt Deu 6:6-9.\x*
\v 19 Teach them \add repeatedly\add* to your children: when you’re sitting at home, when you’re walking down the road, when you go to lie down, and when you get up.
\v 20 \add Carve\add* them on the doorposts of your homes and on your \add city\add* gates,
\v 21 so that your own lifetimes, and the lifetimes of your children will be extended in the land that Yahweh promised to give to your ancestors \add to have\add* as \add long as the sky remains\add* over the earth.
\p
\v 22 If you all follow these instructions that I’m telling you to do, to love your god Yahweh and \add live how he wants you to, and stay faithful\add* to him,
\v 23 then \add he’ll\add* drive all those peoples out \add ahead of\add* you all, and you’ll dispossess groups that are larger and more powerful than yourselves.
\v 24 Every place that your feet step on will become yours: from the \add southern\add* desert to Lebanon \add in the north\add*, and from the Euphrates \add in the east\add* to the Mediterranean Sea \add in the west\add*.\x + \xo 11:24-25: \xt Josh 1:3-5.\x*
\v 25 No one \add will be able to resist\add* you all. Your god Yahweh \add will make those peoples in that land terrified\add* of you, just as he promised he would.
\p
\v 26 \add Now listen,\add* today I’m \add giving you all the option\add* of a blessing or a curse:
\v 27 the blessing is if you all \add decide to\add* obey your god Yahweh’s instructions that I’m giving you today,
\v 28 \add but\add* the curse is if you all don’t \add take any notice\add* of \add his\add* instructions, or if you turn away from what I’m commanding you all today to go after other gods that you \add previously had nothing to do with\add*.
\v 29 Whenever your god Yahweh brings you into the land that you’re entering to take possession of, you must \add pronounce\add* the blessing from Mt. Gerizim, and the curse from Mt. Eyval.\x + \xo 11:29: \xt Deu 27:11-14; Josh 8:33-35.\x*
\v 30 (Those two mountains are across the Yarden \add river\add*, west of the river plain where the Canaanites live, near the Oak of Moreh opposite Gilgal.)
\v 31 You’ll all \add soon\add* be crossing the Yarden to go in and occupy the land that your god Yahweh is giving you. \add As\add* you all \add take it over\add* and \add start to\add* live there,
\v 32 \add make sure that\add* you follow all the instructions and rules that I’m giving to you all today.
\c 12
\s1 One place for future worship
\p
\v 1 In the land that your god Yahweh has given you to own, these are the rules and regulations that you must keep obeying as long as you’re alive.
\v 2 When you drive those peoples out, you all must completely destroy all the places on the mountains and hills, and under the large trees where they served their gods.
\v 3 You all must tear down their altars, shatter their stone pillars, and set fire to their Asherah poles. You must chop down their carved idols so they won’t be remembered in that place any more.\x + \xo 12:3: \xt Deu 7:5.\x*
\p
\v 4 Don’t worship your god Yahweh \add the same way they worship their gods\add*,
\v 5 because you all must go to the \add single\add* place that Yahweh’s going to choose out of all your tribes, that he’ll attach his name to, so if you want find his residence, you’ll have to go there.
\v 6 That will \add also\add* be where you’ll all have to take your animal sacrifices and offerings, as well as the tenth of your \add produce and animals\add*, \add special contributions\add*, sacrifices for promises, free-will sacrifices, and the firstborn animals from your herds and flocks.
\v 7 You’ll all be able to take your families there in front of your god Yahweh to cheerfully eat \add what you’ve produced as a result of his blessing\add*.
\p
\v 8 We won’t be able to continue like we are at present, with each person \add worshipping however they feel is right\add*
\v 9 because until now, you haven’t reached the inheritance and the \add peaceful life\add* that your god Yahweh is giving to you.
\v 10 \add After\add* you all cross the Yarden and live in the land that your god Yahweh is giving you as an inheritance, it’s then that he’ll give you \add peace\add* from all your surrounding enemies, and \add so\add* you’ll all live safely.
\v 11 Then your god Yahweh will choose one place to \add attach his name to\add*, and that’s where you’ll all bring everything that I tell you to: your animal sacrifices and offerings, as well as the tenth of your \add produce and animals\add*, \add special contributions\add*, and sacrifices for promises made to Yahweh.
\v 12 You’ll all celebrate there in front of Yahweh: you and your children and your servants, along with any Levites \add who live in your towns\add* (because they don’t \add personally inherit any land of their own\add*).
\v 13 \add Make sure\add* that you don’t offer burnt sacrifices at any place that you \add just decide is good\add*—
\v 14 only at the place that Yahweh will choose from one of your tribes. That’s where you’ll offer your sacrifices, and do everything else that I tell you.
\p
\v 15 However, you may kill and eat your animals \add wherever you live as much as you want\add*. Those animals are blessings from your god Yahweh. You can eat that meat \add whether or not you’re ceremonially ‘clean’\add*, just like you’d eat a \add wild\add* gazelle or deer.
\v 16 \add However,\add* don’t eat the blood—it must be poured out on the ground like water.\x + \xo 12:16: \xt Gen 9:4; Lev 7:26-27; 17:10-14; 19:6; Deu 15:23.\x*
\v 17 In your towns, don’t eat the tenth of your \add produce\add* or the firstborns from your herd or flock, or at the celebration of a vow, or any free-will offering or contribution \add that you’ve made\add*.
\v 18 You can only eat those in Yahweh’s presence in the place that \add he’ll\add* choose. \add The same applies to\add* your children, your servants, and any Levites who live \add in your towns\add*. \add The celebration for what you’ve produced must be done in front of\add* your god Yahweh.
\v 19 \add Make sure\add* that you don’t neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.
\p
\v 20 \add In the future, when\add* your god Yahweh widens your territory like he’s said he would, if you want to eat meat there, then \add go ahead and do it\add*.
\v 21 If the place that \add he\add* chooses \add to attach his name to\add* is too far away, then \add it’s permissible\add* to sacrifice like I’ve instructed you from your herd or flock, and you can eat it \add where you live whenever you want\add*.
\v 22 You can eat it \add whether or not you’re ceremonially ‘clean’\add*, just like you’d eat a \add wild\add* gazelle or deer.
\v 23 \add However,\add* don’t eat the blood of any animal, because the blood is the life and you mustn’t eat the life with the meat.\x + \xo 12:23-24: \xt Lev 17:10-14.\x*
\v 24 Don’t eat \add the blood\add*—it must be poured out on the ground like water.
\v 25 Don’t eat it so that things will go well for you and your children after you, when you do what Yahweh \add says is right\add*.
\v 26 \add However, you still must take\add* your sacred things and offerings for vows to the place that Yahweh will choose.
\v 27 The meat and blood from burnt offerings must only be placed on your god Yahweh’s \add future\add* altar, and the blood of your \add other\add* sacrifices must be poured on the altar, \add but\add* you can eat the meat.
\v 28 \add Make sure to follow\add* all these instructions that I’m giving you so that everything will go well for you and for your descendants into the future, when you do what your god Yahweh has said is good and right.
\s1 Warnings about false gods
\p
\v 29 When you enter the land that you will occupy, your god Yahweh \add will destroy the people groups that live there as you advance\add*.
\v 30 Watch out after they’ve been destroyed, that you don’t get trapped \add by curiosity about how they served their gods, and then you end up doing the same\add*.
\v 31 Don’t do that to your god Yahweh, because \add he\add* hates the disgusting things they’ve done for their gods—even burning their own sons and daughters \add on altars\add* for their gods.
\p
\v 32 \add Make sure that\add* you obey all those instructions—don’t add anything to them, or remove anything from them.\x + \xo 12:32: \xt Deu 4:2; Rev 22:18-19.\x*
\c 13
\s1 Warnings about false prophets
\p
\v 1 If someone among you \add claims\add* to be a prophet or interpreter of dreams, or \add able to do miracles\add*,
\v 2 \add and it seems true, but they use those things to convince you to go after other ‘new’\add* gods and worship them,
\v 3 then don’t listen to that person, because your god Yahweh is testing you to know whether you love \add him\add* with \add sincerity and with your energy\add*.
\v 4 You must \add conduct your lives as your god Yahweh wants you to\add*. Honour him, and listen to his voice and follow his instructions, and serve him and \add remain loyal\add* to him.
\v 5 \add But\add* that prophet or interpreter of dreams must be executed because they’ve incited rebellion against your god Yahweh who brought you all out from slavery in Egypt. Those \add kinds of\add* people want to drive you away from @Yahweh’s instructions, hence why you must remove that evil from among you.
\p
\v 6 Your brother, son, daughter, \add beloved\add* wife, or \add some close\add* friend might privately urge you to worship other gods that you and your ancestors hadn’t heard about before.
\v 7 \add That might be\add* the gods of the surrounding peoples, either nearby or \add right across the world\add*.
\v 8 Don’t give in to them, or take notice of them. Don’t even \add feel sympathy for them or cover up for them\add*,
\v 9 because \add you’ll definitely need to execute them\add*. \add You yourself must be the first to take action, followed by the rest of the community\add*.
\v 10 You must \add execute people like that by throwing rocks at them\add*, because they try to drive you away from your god Yahweh who brought you out of \add slavery\add* in Egypt.
\v 11 \add After that,\add* all Yisrael will hear and \add become afraid of doing such wicked things in the future\add*.
\p
\v 12 If \add in the future\add*, you hear that in one of the cities that your god Yahweh will give you to live in,
\v 13 some wicked people have enticed those in the city to go and serve other ‘new’ gods,
\v 14 then you must thoroughly investigate the matter. If it’s actually true that that disgusting thing had been done among you,
\v 15 then all the people in that place must be executed by the sword, along with all their livestock.
\v 16 Gather all the people’s possessions and pile them up in the city plaza, then burn the place and everything in it like a ‘burnt offering’ to Yahweh. Leave the place as an abandoned heap—it should never be rebuilt again.
\v 17 Don’t \add be tempted\add* to \add pick anything valuable out\add* from the \add pile headed for destruction\add*, \add but obey carefully\add* so that Yahweh’s \add anger will subside\add*. Then he’ll show compassion to you and mercy, and make you increase like he promised to your ancestors
\v 18 when you listen to \add what he says\add*—following all his instructions and doing what \add he\add* says is the right thing to do.
\c 14
\s1 Prohibitions during mourning
\p
\v 1 You’re all children of your god Yahweh \add so\add* don’t cut yourselves or shave the front of your heads for \add the sake of\add* the dead,\x + \xo 14:1: \xt Lev 19:28; 21:5.\x*
\v 2 because you’re a nation that’s set apart for your god Yahweh, and \add he’s\add* chosen you out of all the other peoples in the world to be his own people.\x + \xo 14:2: \xt Exo 19:5-6; Deu 4:20; 7:6; 26:18; Tit 2:14; 1Pe 2:9.\x*
\s1 ‘Clean’ and ‘unclean’ foods
\r (Lev. 11:1-47)
\p
\v 3 Don’t eat anything \add that Yahweh detests\add*.
\v 4 These are the animals that you all can eat: cattle, sheep, goats,
\v 5 \add all kinds of\add* deer, gazelles, wild goats, and mountain sheep,
\v 6 \add i.e.,\add* you can eat any of the animals that have split hooves and that also chew the cud.
\v 7 But there are other animals that chew the cud that you mustn’t eat: camels, \add rabbits and hares\add*, and rock badgers. They chew the cud, but don’t have split hooves so they are \add unacceptable\add* for you to eat.
\v 8 Don’t eat pigs—they’re unacceptable for you to eat. They have split hooves, but they don’t chew the cud. Don’t eat the meat of those animals and don’t even touch their dead bodies.
\p
\v 9 You all can eat anything that \add lives\add* in water that has \add both\add* fins and scales,
\v 10 but anything \add in the water\add* that doesn’t have \add both\add* is \add unacceptable\add* for you to eat.
\p
\v 11 You all can eat any clean bird,
\v 12 \add but\add* not these: eagles, vultures, ospreys,
\v 13 buzzards, kites, falcons,
\v 14 any kind of ravens or crows,
\v 15 ostriches, owls, seagulls, any kind of hawk,
\v 16 \add any kinds of\add* owls,
\v 17 pelicans, carrion vultures, cormorants,
\v 18 storks, any kind of heron, hoopoes, or bats.
\v 19 You mustn’t eat any insect with wings and which swarm—they’re unacceptable \add to Yahweh\add* for you to eat,
\v 20 \add but other insects with wings are acceptable to\add* eat.
\p
\v 21 Don’t eat any creature that’s died \add naturally\add*. You may allow foreigners who live among you to eat those things. You may also sell them to other foreigners. But you are a people group that belongs to your god Yahweh.
\p You mustn’t cook a young sheep or goat in its mother’s milk.\x + \xo 14:21: \xt Exo 23:19; 34:26.\x*
\p
\v 22 \add Make sure\add* you set aside a tenth of all the \add crops that you harvest from your fields\add*.\x + \xo 14:22-29: \xt Lev 27:30-33; Num 18:21.\x*
\v 23 You must eat it \add in the presence of\add* your god Yahweh, in the place that he’ll choose and \add attach his name to\add*. That’s where you must eat the tenth of your grain, wine, \add olive\add* oil, and the firstborn \add male animals\add* from your herd and your flock, so that you’ll learn to always honour your god Yahweh.
\v 24 When \add he\add* blesses you \add with produce\add*, if the place he chooses to attach his name to is too far for you to be able to carry it to,
\v 25 then you can \add give the equivalent in cash\add*, and \add carefully take the cash with you all the way\add* to the place that \add he\add* chooses.
\v 26 \add When you get there\add*, \add use the money to purchase any kinds of meat or drink that you want\add*, and consume it there \add in front of\add* your god Yahweh, and celebrate along with your household.
\p
\v 27 \add Be sure\add* not to neglect any Levites that live in your town, because \add they weren’t given ancestral land for agriculture like you were\add*.
\v 28 At the end of every third year, bring the tenth of all your produce for that year and store it in your town
\v 29 for the Levites (because they didn’t get land), and for any foreigners, orphans, and widows who live in your towns. They can come and \add get what they need\add* so that your god Yahweh can bless you in everything that you do.

\s1 The 7-year economic reset
\r (Lev. 25:1-7)
\p
\v 1 At the end of \add every\add* seven years, you must \add cancel all debts\add*.
\v 2 \add Handle it like\add* this: Everyone who’s loaned money to their \add Israeli\add* neighbour \add must cancel that debt, i.e.,\add* they must not insist that it’s paid back, because Yahweh has announced a cancellation.
\v 3 You can pressure a foreigner to repay, but you must cancel any debt from a fellow Israeli.
\p
\v 4 However, there shouldn’t be any poor among you, because your god Yahweh will bless you in the land that \add he’s\add* giving you to own as an inheritance,
\v 5 as long as you listen to \add what he says\add* and keep following these instructions that I’m telling you today.
\v 6 Because your god Yahweh will bless you (like he promised he would), you’ll lend to many nations rather than borrowing from them, and you’ll rule over many nations rather than them ruling you.
\p
\v 7 \add In the towns\add* that your god Yahweh is giving you, if it so happens that any of your fellow Israelis are poor, then don’t \add just ignore them and refuse to help them,\add*\x + \xo 15:7-8: \xt Lev 25:35.\x*
\v 8 but instead, open your \add wallet\add* and lend them however much they need.
\v 9 \add Be careful not to quietly think to yourself that the seventh-year reset\add* is close \add so they won’t have to pay it back.\add* It would be wrong not to help a fellow Israeli, and if you did and he called out to Yahweh for help, then it would be \add counted against you as disobedience\add*.
\v 10 \add Give generously to the poor without getting resentful inside\add*, because then your god Yahweh can bless you in all your work and \add all your investments\add*.
\v 11 \add There’ll always be poor people in your country\add*, so I command you to give generously to the poor and needy and your fellow Israelis.\x + \xo 15:11: \xt Mat 26:11; Mrk 14:7; Yhn 12:8.\x*
\s1 Freeing slaves
\r (Exo. 21:1-11)
\p
\v 12 If a \add fellow Israeli\add* is sold to you\f + \fr 15:12 \ft Often to pay off their debt.\f* and serves you for six years, then you must free them in the seventh year.\x + \xo 15:12-18: \xt Lev 25:39-46.\x*
\v 13 \add But\add* when you free them, don’t send them off \add empty-handed\add*
\v 14 \add but instead,\add* give to them generously from your flock and from your \add barn\add* and from your wine. \add In whatever ways\add* your god Yahweh has blessed you, you should give to them.
\v 15 \add Always\add* remember that you were a slave in Egypt and your god Yahweh redeemed you \add out of there\add*, so that’s why I’m commanding you to do that.
\p
\v 16 \add However,\add* if any slave says that they don’t want to leave you, because they \add appreciate\add* you and your household, and so they’re better off to stay with you,
\v 17 then get an awl and \add stand them against the doorpost\add* and pierce one of their earlobes with the awl, then that person (male or female) will be your slave forever.
\v 18 \add Don’t complain\add* when you have to release your slaves, because they’ve served you \add up to\add* six years and \add been double the value\add* of a \add regular\add* hired worker, plus your god Yahweh will bless you in whatever you do.
\s1 The firstborn animals
\p
\v 19 You must set apart for your god Yahweh, all the firstborn male animals from your herds and your flocks. You mustn’t use the cattle for working, and mustn’t shear the sheep or goats.\x + \xo 15:19: \xt Exo 13:12.\x*
\v 20 Each year, you and your household must \add take them\add* to the place that Yahweh will choose, and eat them there in front of \add him\add*.
\v 21 \add However,\add* any animals that have defects (e.g., lame or blind, or with a severe blemish) mustn’t be sacrificed to your god Yahweh.
\v 22 \add Instead,\add* you can eat those \add at home\add* \add whether or not you’re ceremonially ‘clean’\add*, just like you’d eat a \add wild\add* gazelle or deer.
\v 23 \add However,\add* don’t eat the blood—it must be poured out on the ground like water.\x + \xo 15:23: \xt Gen 9:4; Lev 7:26-27; 17:10-14; 19:26; Deu 12:16-23.\x*
\c 16
\s1 The messenger’s ‘pass-over’ celebration
\r (Exo. 12:1-20)
\p
\v 1 \add Each year, honour\add* your god Yahweh \add in the early spring\add* by celebrating the ‘pass-over’, because it was one night \add in the early spring\add* that \add he\add* brought you out of Egpyt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add*.\x + \xo 16:1-8: \xt Exo 12:1-20; Lev 23:5-8; Num 28:16-25.\x*
\v 2 \add In order to celebrate, go to\add* the place that your god Yahweh will choose \add to attach his name to\add*, and there sacrifice to \add him\add* one \add young\add* animal from your flock or herd.
\v 3 Don’t eat any leavened bread with it. For seven days, you must eat flat bread (the bread of suffering) because you came out of Egypt in a rush. That’s how you should remember the day of your exit from Egypt for the rest of your life.
\v 4 \add In fact,\add* for seven days you shouldn’t even have any rising agent within your borders, and none of the meat from the sacrifice on that first evening is allowed to be left until the morning.
\p
\v 5 You mustn’t sacrifice the ‘pass-over’ \add animal\add* within any of your towns that your god Yahweh is giving to you—
\v 6 only at the place that your god Yahweh will choose to \add attach his name to\add*. That’s where you must sacrifice the ‘pass-over’ \add animal\add* at sunset, which was the time when \add your ancestors\add* started leaving Egypt.
\v 7 You must cook the meat and eat it at the place that Yahweh will choose, then in the morning you can \add start\add* returning to your \add homes\add*.
\v 8 Then for six days you must only eat flat bread, and the seventh day is a special celebration for your god Yahweh—don’t do any work on that day.
\s1 The harvest celebration
\r (Exo. 34:22; Lev. 23:15-21)
\p
\v 9 You must count off seven weeks \add starting from when the very first harvesting of grain begins\add*.\x + \xo 16:9-12: \xt Lev 23:15-21; Num 28:26-31.\x*
\v 10 Then celebrate the ‘Festival of Weeks’\f + \fr 16:10 \ft Also known as the ‘Harvest Festival’ or ‘Pentecost’ (relating to the fifty days = seven weeks plus one day).\f* \add to honour\add* your god Yahweh by contributing a freewill offering \add acknowledging\add* however much \add he\add* has blessed you.
\v 11 You should celebrate in Yahweh’s presence, along with your children and your servants, and any Levites living in your town, and the foreigners, orphans, and widows living among you. Take your offerings to the place that your god Yahweh will choose \add to attach his name to\add*.
\v 12 \add Always\add* remember that you were a slave in Egypt, \add so carefully follow those instructions\add*.
\s1 The celebration in temporary huts
\r (Lev. 23:33-43)
\p
\v 13 \add After\add* you’ve brought in the grain harvest and pressed out the grape juice, you must celebrate the ‘Festival of Shelters’ for seven days.\x + \xo 16:13-15: \xt Lev 23:33-36,39-43; Num 29:12-38.\x*
\v 14 You should celebrate along with your children and your servants, as well as any Levites and foreigners and orphans and widows who live in your town.
\v 15 \add Honour\add* your god Yahweh at the place \add he’ll\add* choose, by celebrating for seven days because \add he’s\add* blessed your harvest and \add all your other work\add*.
\p
\v 16 \add In summary,\add* all your men must travel three times each year to the place that your god Yahweh will choose: at the Flat Bread Celebration, at the Festival of Weeks, and at the Festival of Shelters. \add No man should come empty-handed\add*,
\v 17 \add but rather,\add* each man \add must give in proportion\add* to the blessings that your god Yahweh has given you \add during that year\add*.
\s1 Strive for justice
\p
\v 18 You must appoint judges and other officials throughout your tribes, in all the towns that your god Yahweh is giving to you. They must judge the people \add fairly and correctly\add*.
\v 19 You mustn’t \add pervert justice or give favours\add*. Don’t accept bribes because a bribe causes \add an otherwise\add* wise person to \add ignore evil\add* and \add misrepresents what innocent people say\add*.\x + \xo 16:19: \xt Exo 23:6-8; Lev 19:15.\x*
\v 20 \add True justice is what you should aim for\add*, so that you’ll occupy and live in the land that your god Yahweh is giving you.
\s1 Prohibitions in worship and justice
\p
\v 21 Never put an Asherah pole near the altar to your god Yahweh that you’ll build for yourself,\x + \xo 16:21: \xt Exo 34:13.\x*
\v 22 and don’t erect any stone pillars that your god Yahweh hates.\x + \xo 16:22: \xt Lev 26:1.\x*
\c 17
\p
\v 1 Don’t sacrifice any \add animal\add* to your god Yahweh that has any blemish or defect, because \add he\add* detests that.
\p
\v 2 In any of the towns that your god Yahweh is giving you, if you discover any man or woman who does evil by disobeying the agreement that \add he’s\add* made with you
\v 3 and \add worshipped\add* other gods, or the sun, moon, or stars—all of which I’ve prohibited you from doing,\x + \xo 17:3: \xt Exo 22:20.\x*
\v 4 and it it’s reported to you, and you listen and investigate it thoroughly, and it’s true that this detestable thing was done in Yisrael,
\v 5 you must bring that man or woman out to the \add town\add* gates, and \add execute them by throwing rocks at them\add*.
\v 6 \add Note that\add* that person can only be executed if there’s at least two witnesses \add as evidence\add*—no one can be put to death on the testimony of just one witness.\x + \xo 17:6: \xt Num 35:30; Deu 19:15; Mat 18:16; 2Cor 13:1; 1Tim 5:19; Heb 10:28.\x*
\v 7 \add The witnesses must be the ones to throw the first rocks\add* then all the other people after that, and that’s how you’ll remove evil \add from your society\add*.\x + \xo 17:7: \xt 1Cor 5:13.\x*
\p
\v 8 If a case is too difficult for you yourselves to judge \add (e.g., two parties claiming bloodshed, or lawsuits, or assaults, or other disputes within your towns)\add*, you must leave town and go to the place that your god Yahweh is going to choose.
\v 9 You should go to the \add Levitical priests\add* and to the judge \add on duty there\add* and they will \add produce\add* a judgement.
\v 10 Whatever the decision is that’s made at the place Yahweh will choose, \add that’s the verdict that must be applied to the case\add*—
\v 11 accept their judgement and do what they say without making any adjustments to their decision.
\v 12 Anyone who \add shows\add* contempt for \add the decision of\add* the judge or the priest who’s standing there serving your god Yahweh, then that person must be executed \add to\add* remove that evil from Yisrael,
\v 13 then all the people will hear \add about it\add* and be afraid, and \add it’ll stamp out such arrogance\add*.
\s1 Expectations for a king
\p
\v 14 When you enter the land that your god Yahweh is about to give you, then occupy and live in it, and you say that you need a king over you like all the surrounding countries have,\x + \xo 17:14: \xt 1Sam 8:5.\x*
\v 15 you can appoint the king over you that Yahweh chooses. Your king must be \add an Israeli\add*—\add never allow a foreigner to become your king\add*.
\v 16 However, he mustn’t acquire a large number of horses for himself, and he should never send people to Egypt to buy horses, because Yahweh has told you all to never go back that way again.\x + \xo 17:16: \xt 1Ki 10:28; 2Ch 1:16; 9:28.\x*
\v 17 He mustn’t \add take a lot of wives for himself\add* \add or else he might stop\add* \add worshipping Yahweh\add*. Nor should he \add accumulate too much\add* gold and silver.\x + \xo 17:17: a \xt 1Ki 11:1-8; \xo b \xt 1Ki 10:14-22,27; 2Ch 1:15; 9:27.\x*
\p
\v 18 Once he’s sitting on his \add royal\add* throne, he must copy for himself the instructions on the scroll \add that’s in the custody of\add* the Levitical priests,
\v 19 then he must keep it with him and read \add some of\add* it every day so that he learns to honour his god Yahweh—being careful to follow all the instructions and regulations written in it
\v 20 so that he won’t \add think he’s more valued than his fellow citizens\add*, and so that he doesn’t \add ignore those instructions even slightly\add*. \add As a result, him and his descendants will rule as kings in Yisrael for many years\add*.
\c 18
\s1 Portions for Levites
\p
\v 1 None of the Levites (including the priests) will receive \add any land as\add* an inheritance like the \add other Israelis\add*. \add Instead, the people’s offerings to Yahweh will be their inheritance to sustain them\add*.
\v 2 \add Yes,\add* unlike \add fellow Israelis\add*, they won’t have any inherited \add land\add*—Yahweh is their inheritance like he told them.\x + \xo 18:2: \xt Num 18:20.\x*
\p
\v 3 This is the requirement that the people do for the priests: whenever they bring a bull or a sheep as a sacrifice, they must give the shoulder, the cheeks, and the stomach to the priest.
\v 4 Also you must give \add the Levites\add* the firstfruits of your grain, your grape juice, your \add olive\add* oil, and the wool shorn from your sheep,
\v 5 because your god Yahweh chose them out of all your tribes for them and their descendants permanently to serve \add him\add*.
\p
\v 6 If a Levite chooses to move \add his family\add* from their town in any part of Yisrael and sincerely wants to go to the place that Yahweh will choose,
\v 7 then he can join the other Levites there to serve his god Yahweh
\v 8 \add and must be given a portion like all the others\add*. (\add He can keep anything he got from the sale of their family home\add*.)
\s1 Warnings against divination and magic
\p
\v 9 When you enter the land that your god Yahweh is about to give you, don’t \add imitate the disgusting habits\add* of those peoples.
\v 10 There mustn’t be anyone among you who passes their son or daughter through fire, or who uses divination or omens \add to try to tell the future\add*, or who practices sorcery,\x + \xo 18:10: a \xt Lev 19:26; \xo b \xt Exo 22:18.\x*
\v 11 \add or who puts spells on people, or who tries to talk to spirits of deceased people\add*,
\v 12 because anyone who does those things is abhorrent to Yahweh. It’s because of those kinds of things that your god Yahweh will drive \add those other peoples\add* \add away ahead of you\add*.
\v 13 You must be a blameless \add nation in the eyes\add* of your god Yahweh,\x + \xo 18:13: \xt Mat 5:48.\x*
\v 14 because the groups that you’ll \add expel from the land\add* \add rely on\add* fortune-tellers and diviners, but your god Yahweh won’t allow you to do that.
\s1 Yahweh promises to send prophets
\p
\v 15 Your god Yahweh will \add select a man from among you and send him as\add* a prophet like me. You must \add take notice of\add* him,\x + \xo 18:15: \xt Acts 3:22; 7:37.\x*
\v 16 since you \add begged\add* your god Yahweh from \add the bottom of Mt.\add* Horev when you said, “\add We can’t handle directly hearing\add* the voice of our god Yahweh and \add looking at this terrible\add* fire. \add Let us go home\add* so we won’t die \add here\add*.”
\v 17 Then Yahweh told me, “\add They’re right in what they’re saying\add*.
\v 18 I’ll \add choose a prophet from among them and see him\add*. I’ll \add tell him what to say, and he can pass it on\add* to them,
\v 19 and if anyone doesn’t listen to what he says \add with my authority\add*, I’ll \add punish that person\add* \add as if they ignored me\add*.\x + \xo 18:19: \xt Acts 3:23.\x*
\v 20 However, if the prophet \add says things that I didn’t tell him to say but claims they came from me\add*, or if he speaks in the name of other gods, then that prophet must die.”
\p
\v 21 Now if you ask yourselves, “How can we \add recognise a message that didn’t come from\add* Yahweh?”
\v 22 then when the prophet speaks in Yahweh’s name but that thing doesn’t happen, then you’ll know that it didn’t come from Yahweh. The prophet spoke it \add assuming that I’d want that\add*, but you don’t need to be afraid of him.
\c 19
\s1 The refuge cities
\r (Num. 35:9-28; Josh. 20:1-9)
\p
\v 1 When your god Yahweh destroys those peoples where \add he’s\add* giving you the land, and you occupy the land and live in their cities and houses,
\v 2 you must select three cities\x + \xo 19:1-13: \xt Josh 20:1-9.\x* \add spread across\add* the land that Yahweh is giving you.
\v 3 You must \add define\add* three borders and \add build roads\add* in the land that your god Yahweh is giving you to inherit. \add Anyone who kills another person\add* can then flee to \add one of those cities\add*.
\v 4 This is the rule for someone who’s killed another person and flees to live there: if \add they’ve accidentally killed another person\add* and \add had no hate for that person from past events\add*,
\v 5 (for example, if two men went into the forest to chop wood and an axe head flew off its handle and killed the other man) then \add that accidental killer\add* can flee to one of those cities and live there.
\v 6 \add Otherwise a friend or relative of the dead person might chase the killer in a sudden rage\add* and overtake and kill \add the accidental killer\add* if \add the city was too far away\add*. \add However, the killer doesn’t deserve death\add* if they hadn’t hated that person \add from past events\add*—
\v 7 that’s why I’m ordering you to select three cities \add for this\add*.
\p
\v 8 \add Then in the future,\add* if your god Yahweh extends your \add territory\add* as he promised your ancestors that he would do, and gives you all the land that he told \add them\add* about,
\v 9 and if you’re \add still\add* following all these instructions that I’m giving you today (loving your god Yahweh and \add always\add* \add obeying what he’s said\add*), then you’ll \add need to\add* add three more \add refuge\add* cities for your \add country\add*.
\v 10 \add That’s so\add* innocent \add people won’t be killed\add* in the land that your god Yahweh is giving you, and \add so that\add* you \add won’t be found guilty of the murder of that accidental killer\add*.
\p
\v 11 \add However, if someone hates another person and then ambushes them and kills them\add*, and then flees to one of those cities,
\v 12 then the elders from their home town \add should go and get that person\add* from the \add refuge city\add* and hand \add that killer\add* over to \add the relatives handling the case\add*, and \add the murderer\add* must be executed.
\v 13 You must \add show no mercy to murderers\add* \add but they must be executed\add* \add so that the country isn’t responsible for the blood of innocent people\add*, and then things will go well for you.
\s1 Respecting boundaries
\p
\v 14 \add Once you’re\add* in the land that your god Yahweh is giving you to occupy, you mustn’t move the boundary markers which were set \add between you and your neighbour\add*.\x + \xo 19:14: \xt Deu 27:17.\x*
\s1 Concerning witnesses in court
\p
\v 15 \add A single witness must not be used to condemn anyone\add*—a matter \add must only be considered proven if there’s at least\add* two or three witnesses.\x + \xo 19:15: \xt Num 35:30; Deu 17:6; Mat 18:16; Yhn 8:17; 2Cor 13:1; 1Tim 5:19; Heb 10:28.\x*
\v 16 \add Suppose\add* that a ‘witness’ \add brought a false allegation\add* against a man,
\v 17 then \add both parties\add* must go and stand \add in front of\add* Yahweh—\add in front of the priests and judges on duty at that time\add*.
\v 18 The judges must investigate \add the case\add* thoroughly, and if the witness is \add proved to be lying\add* (\add and so falsely accusing a fellow citizen\add*),
\v 19 you must \add give the false witness the punishment\add* that was planned for \add the person falsely accused\add*, and that’s how you can remove the evil from among your \add nation\add*.
\v 20 Then the \add rest of the people\add* will hear \add about that\add* and be afraid \add to do that kind of evil thing in your country\add*.
\v 21 Don’t pity \add violent people\add*: it’s a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, and a foot for a foot.\x + \xo 19:21: \xt Exo 21:23-25; Lev 24:19-20; Mat 5:38.\x*
\c 20
\s1 Rules of battle
\p
\v 1 When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see \add many\add* horses and chariots \add and a bigger army than yours\add*, don’t be afraid of them, because your god Yahweh who \add helped you out of\add* Egypt is with you.
\v 2 As you approach the \add place of\add* battle, the \add high\add* priest must go and stand in front of the \add warriors\add*,
\v 3 and tell them, “Listen, Yisrael, you’re about to battle against your enemies. Don’t \add be nervous\add* or afraid, and don’t tremble or be terrified of them,
\v 4 because your god Yahweh will go with you to fight for you against your enemies. \add He’ll\add* \add give you victory\add*.”
\p
\v 5 Then the \add officers must ask\add* the people, “Is there anyone here who’s just built a new house and hasn’t dedicated it yet? If so, he can go home in case he dies in battle and \add someone else gets to\add* dedicate his house.
\v 6 Is there anyone who’s planted a vineyard and not \add benefitted from it yet\add*? If so, he can go home in case he dies in battle and \add someone else enjoys the grape harvest\add*.
\v 7 Is there anyone who’s gotten engaged, but not yet married? If so, he can go home in case he died in battle and \add someone else marries\add* her.”
\p
\v 8 Then those officers should also ask, “Is there anyone who’s scared or \add fearful\add*? If so, he should go home \add so his fear doesn’t spread to others\add*.”
\v 9 Once they’ve finished speaking with the \add fighting men\add*, they must appoint commanders over \add them\add*.
\p
\v 10 When you approach a city \add ready to attack it\add*, \add first\add* call out to offer peace \add for surrender\add*,
\v 11 and if they \add agree to surrender\add* and open the city gates, then they’ll all be forced to work for you.
\v 12 \add But\add* if they \add refuse your terms\add* and decide to fight against you, then you should besiege that city.
\v 13 Then when your god Yahweh \add helps you to capture it\add*, you must \add kill\add* every male in that city.
\v 14 \add However,\add* you can take the women and children and cattle and everything \add else\add* in the city as plunder for yourself. You can enjoy your enemies’ possessions that Yahweh has given to you.
\v 15 That’s \add how you should treat\add* the cities located far from you—it doesn’t apply to the cities of nearby peoples.
\p
\v 16 \add In contrast,\add* the cities of those peoples that your god Yahweh is giving you as an inheritance, \add you mustn’t leave a single living thing alive\add*
\v 17 because you must complete eliminate the Hittes, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Yevusites. Do that just as your god Yahweh commanded you
\v 18 so that they don’t teach you to sin against Yahweh by doing any of their abhorrent activities that they do for their gods.
\p
\v 19 When you besiege a city \add for a lengthy period\add*, battling against it to capture it, you mustn’t use your axes to destroy its trees, because you can eat \add their fruit\add*. Don’t cut them down because the trees in the countryside \add aren’t likely to turn around and attack you\add*.
\v 20 \add However, the trees that aren’t fruit trees\add* can be cut down and make \add ladders and towers to enable you to go over the walls and capture the city that is resisting\add* you.
\c 21
\s1 Handling an unseen murder
\p
\v 1 If a \add dead body\add* is found in the land that your god Yahweh is about to give you, and \add it appears that\add* \add that person\add* had been killed out in the countryside \add by some unknown person\add*,
\v 2 then your elders and your judges must go out and \add work out the distance to each of the towns close to that victim\add*.
\v 3 Then the elders from that closest town must select a heifer from their herd that’s \add never been yoked or had to pull anything\add*,
\v 4 and take it down into a valley that has a stream \add but the ground\add* has never been ploughed or planted. They must break its neck there
\v 5 and the Levitical priests must approach it because your god Yahweh has chosen them to serve him and \add pronounce blessings on Yahweh’s behalf\add*, and to \add give rulings\add* on disputes and assaults.
\v 6 Then all the elders from that closest town must wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley,
\v 7 and say, “We didn’t murder this person, nor did we see who did it.
\v 8 Yahweh, forgive your people of Yisraelite who you rescued \add from Egypt\add*. Don’t count us as guilty for murdering an innocent person.” \add When they do that,\add* \add Yisrael will be forgiven for that murder\add*.
\v 9 \add That’s how\add* \add your country\add* will remove from yourselves the guilt of shedding innocent blood, when you do what’s right in Yahweh’s eyes.
\s1 Handling captured women
\p
\v 10 When you go out to battle against your enemies and your god Yahweh \add helps you defeat them\add*, and you \add capture some of their people\add*
\v 11 and \add you notice an attractive\add* woman that you’d like to take as a wife,
\v 12 then you must \add publicly\add* take her to your house. There you must shave off her hair and trim her nails,
\v 13 and \add discard the clothes she was wearing when she was captured\add*. She must stay in that house, and be allowed an \add entire\add* month to mourn for \add her parents\add* before she’s taken to be your wife.
\v 14 If you’re not happy with her, then you can’t sell her—you must release her to go wherever she wants because you’ve already humiliated her.
\s1 The oldest son’s inheritance
\p
\v 15 If a man has two wives \add and loves one more than the other\add*, \add but\add* they’ve both given birth to sons for him \add but the oldest son is from the wife he dislikes\add*,
\v 16 then \add when he assigns his inheritance to his sons, he mustn’t favour the son of the favourite wife over that eldest son\add*.
\v 17 \add Instead,\add* he must acknowledge the son of the wife he dislikes, and given him double of everything, because \add that son\add* is the beginning of his strength, and the largest share belongs to him.
\s1 The rebellious child
\p
\v 18 If a person has a stubborn, rebellious son who won’t listen to the voice of his parents, and they \add tell him off\add*, but he \add still\add* won’t listen to them,
\v 19 then his parents must \add physically\add* bring him to the elders at the gate of his \add hometown\add*.
\v 20 Then they must tell \add those\add* elders, “Our son is stubborn and rebellious and pays no attention to what we say—he’s a glutton and a drunkard.”
\v 21 Then all the men from that place must \add execute him by throwing rocks at\add* him, \add thus\add* removing that evil from among you. Then everyone in Yisrael will hear about it and be afraid \add to imitate him\add*.
\s1 Miscellaneous rules
\p
\v 22 If someone has committed a \add crime\add* worthy of death, and \add that person\add* is executed and you hang their body on a tree,
\v 23 then the corpse mustn’t remain overnight on the tree—it must be buried that same day, because anyone who’s hanged is cursed by God and you mustn’t defile your country that your god Yahweh is about to give you as an inheritance. \x + \xo 21:23: \xt Gal 3:13.\x*
\c 22
\p
\v 1 If you see \add someone else’s\add* cow or sheep that \add has strayed away\add*, don’t \add act as though you didn’t see it\add*. Take it back to \add its owner\add*.\x + \xo 22:1-4: \xt Exo 23:4-5.\x*
\v 2 \add However,\add* if the owner doesn’t \add live\add* near you, or if you don’t know who it is, then take the animal to your house. It can stay with you until the owner comes looking for it, then you must give it to them.
\v 3 \add Similarly\add* if it’s a donkey or clothing or anything else that someone’s lost, \add don’t pretend that you never saw it\add*.
\p
\v 4 If you see \add someone else’s\add* donkey or cow that’s fallen beside the road, don’t \add act as though you didn’t see it\add*. You must try to help \add the owner\add* to get the animal up.
\p
\v 5 Women mustn’t \add wear\add* men’s clothes, and men mustn’t \add wear\add* women’s clothes. Your god Yahweh \add hates\add* \add people who do things like\add* that.
\p
\v 6 If \add you happen to find\add* a bird’s nest in a tree or on the ground, and the mother bird is sitting in the nest on its eggs or with the baby birds, don’t take \add both the mother bird and the babies\add*.
\v 7 You may take the \add eggs or the baby birds\add*, but you must \add allow the mother bird to fly away\add*. Do that so that things will go well for you and so that you’ll live \add in the land\add* for a long time.
\p
\v 8 When you build a new house, be sure to include a railing around your \add flat\add* roof, so you won’t \add be guilty of having caused someone’s death\add* if a person falls off it \add and dies\add*.
\p
\v 9 Don’t \add plant a crop\add* in your vineyard, because then the harvest of the crop and the fruit from the vineyard will \add both\add* \add be defiled\add*.\f + \fr 22:9 \ft Or possibly, become sacred.\f*\x + \xo 22:9-11: \xt Lev 19:19.\x*
\p
\v 10 Don’t plough with a cow and a donkey \add harnessed\add* together.
\p
\v 11 Don’t wear \add clothes\add* with a mix of wool and linen.
\p
\v 12 \add Twist threads together to\add* make tassels and \add sew them\add* onto the four corners of your cloak.\x + \xo 22:12: \xt Num 15:37-41.\x*
\s1 Rules about marriage and rape
\p
\v 13 If a man takes a wife and \add sleeps with\add* her, then hates her
\v 14 and accuses her of shameful things, \add destroying her reputation\add* and \add claiming that she hadn’t been\add* a virgin,
\v 15 then the young woman’s parents must show the evidence of her virginity\f + \fr 22:15 \ft Presumably, the blood-stained sheet.\f* to the elders at the city gate.
\v 16 The young woman’s father must tell the elders how he gave his daughter to the man as a wife, but now he’s rejected her
\v 17 and made shameful accusations about her not being a virgin. Then the parents must spread out that cloth and show it to the city elders.
\v 18 Then the city elders must punish that man
\v 19 and fine him a hundred silver \add coins\add* to be paid to the young woman’s father for defaming an Israeli virgin. Then she’ll remain as his wife and he’ll be prohibited from \add ever\add* \add divorcing\add* her.
\p
\v 20 \add However,\add* if \add the accusation\add* was true and the young woman \add hadn’t been a virgin\add*,
\v 21 then they must take \add her\add* to the doorway of her father’s house. Then the men from that city must \add execute her by throwing rocks at her\add*, because she’s done a disgraceful thing in Yisrael—committing fornication \add while she still lived in\add* her father’s house. That’s how you’ll remove evil from \add your country\add*.
\p
\v 22 If a man is discovered sleeping with another man’s wife, then both of them must \add be executed\add*. That’s how you’ll remove evil from Yisrael.
\p
\v 23 If a young woman is engaged to a man, and \add another\add* man sleeps with her,
\v 24 then you must execute both of them at the city gate by throwing rocks at them—the young woman because she didn’t scream, and the man for defiling another man’s \add fiancée\add*.
\p
\v 25 If the man found the young woman \add out\add* in the countryside and \add overpowers\add* her and \add rapes\add* her, then the man \add must be executed\add*
\v 26 but don’t do anything to that woman because she’s not worthy of death. (This is similar to the case of a man murdering another man \add out in the countryside\add*.)
\v 27 When that man found her \add out\add* in the countryside, then she would have cried out \add for help\add*, but no \add one was there to save\add* her.
\p
\v 28 If a man \add overpowers\add* a young woman who’s not engaged, and \add rapes\add* her, and it’s discovered,\x + \xo 22:28-29: \xt Exo 22:16-17.\x*
\v 29 that man must pay her father fifty silver coins, and she’ll become his wife because he’s violated her. He’ll then be prohibited from \add ever\add* \add divorcing\add* her.
\p
\v 30 A man must never \add sleep with\add* any of his father’s wives \add because that would expose his father’s nakedness\add*.\x + \xo 22:30: \xt Lev 18:8; 20:11; Deu 27:20.\x*
\c 23
\s1 Excluded people
\p
\v 1 \add No man with crushed testicles\add* or \add a severed penis\add* is allowed to enter into Yahweh’s assembly.
\p
\v 2 No \add illegitimate child\add*\f + \fr 23:2 \ft Or possibly, child from mixed parentage.\f* is allowed to enter into Yahweh’s assembly, even down to the tenth generation.
\p
\v 3 No Ammonite or Moabite is allowed to enter into Yahweh’s assembly, even down past the tenth generation\x + \xo 23:3-5: \xt Neh 13:1-2.\x*
\v 4 since they wouldn’t \add even sell\add* you bread and water when the people were travelling from Egypt \add to Canaan\add*. \add What’s more,\add* they hired Beor’s son Bil’am \add (Balaam)\add* (from Petor in Aram-Naharayim) to curse you
\v 5 \add However,\add* your god Yahweh \add took no notice of\add* Bil’am and turned the curse into a blessing because \add he\add* loves you,\x + \xo 23:5: \xt Num 23:7–24:9.\x*
\v 6 \add so\add* you must \add never\add* strive for peace or prosperity for \add the Ammonites or the Moabites\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add In contrast,\add* don’t despise the Edomites because they’re your \add cousins\add* \add (descendants of your ancestor Yitshak)\add*. And don’t despise the Egyptians, because you \add lived there\add* as foreigners.
\v 8 The third generation \add (grandchildren)\add* of any of \add Edomites or Egyptians\add* that live among you, may enter Yahweh’s assembly.
\s1 Purity when at war
\p
\v 9 When \add your warriors\add* are out besieging your enemies, they you must avoid \add ceremonial impurity\add*.
\v 10 If something happens at night to make a man ‘unclean’, then he must stay outside the camp \add the next day\add* \add and not join the others\add*.
\v 11 That evening, he must wash himself in water, then once the sun has set, he may reenter the camp.
\p
\v 12 You must have a place outside your camp where you can go to \add relieve yourself\add*.
\v 13 You must have a spade among your equipment so that when you go to relieve yourself, you can dig a hole and then cover it up afterwards,
\v 14 because your god Yahweh walks in your camp to give you victory \add to defeat\add* your enemies, so your camp must be sacred so he won’t see anything ‘unclean’ and turn away from you.
\s1 Various regulations
\p
\v 15 You mustn’t \add return\add* any slaves to their master if they escaped and got to you.
\v 16 \add Allow them to stay\add* \add in your town\add* and don’t \add mistreat\add* them.
\p
\v 17 \add Don’t allow any Israeli man or woman to become a religious\add*\f + \fr 23:17 \ft Or, cultic.\f* prostitute.\x + \xo 23:17: \xt Lev 19:29.\x*
\v 18 \add Don’t allow anyone woman or man to bring any part of their wages\add* as a \add secular\add* prostitute into your god Yahweh’s temple, because both \add female and male prostitution\add* is abhorrent to \add him\add*.
\p
\v 19 You mustn’t charge interest to your fellow Israeli, whether it’s money or food or anything else \add that’s borrowed\add*.\x + \xo 23:19-20: \xt Exo 22:25; Lev 25:36-37; Deu 15:7-11.\x*
\v 20 You can charge foreigners interest, but not \add fellow\add* Israelis so that your god Yahweh will bless \add your society\add* in everything you do in the land that you’re about to occupy.
\s1 Making promises to God
\p
\v 21 When you make a vow to your god Yahweh, don’t put off fulfilling it, because \add he\add* will \add hold you accountable\add* and \add not doing it\add* would \add count as\add* \add disobeying him\add*.
\v 22 However \add of course\add*, \add if you don’t make any vows, then you won’t be guilty\add*,
\v 23 \add but\add* if \add you’ve spoken your promise out loud\add* to your god Yahweh, then you’re \add obligated to keep it\add*.
\p
\v 24 If you’re walking through \add someone else’s\add* vineyard, you can eat as many grapes as \add you like\add*, but you mustn’t pick any to \add take away\add* in a container.
\v 25 \add Similarly,\add* if you’re going through \add someone else’s\add* field of grain, you can \add crunch\add* \add a few kernels, but\add* you mustn’t \add cut off any of the stalks\add*.
\c 24
\s1 Divorce and remarriage
\p
\v 1 When a man marries a woman, then \add further on he decides he doesn’t want her because of something he found out about\add* her, then he must write a divorce notice and give it to her, and send her out of his house.\x + \xo 24:1: \xt Mat 5:31; 19:7; Mrk 10:4.\x*
\v 2 \add After she leaves that marriage\add*, \add another man is allowed to marry her\add*.
\v 3 If that \add second\add* husband \add also\add* \add decides to divorce her by sending her away with a divorce notice\add*, or if he were to die,
\v 4 then the first husband isn’t allow to take her back as his wife. \add That’s\add* because she’s been defiled and it would be abhorrent to Yahweh, and you mustn’t defile the land that your god Yahweh is giving you.
\p
\v 5 When a man \add is newly married\add*, he mustn’t \add be called for\add* the army \add or be given any other responsibilities\add*. He must be free for one year \add to establish his house\add* and \add to satisfy his new\add* wife.
\p
\v 6 \add If someone borrows money,\add* \add the lender\add* mustn’t take their millstone \add for grinding grain\add* as a pledge, because \add they need it to stay alive\add*.
\s1 Abduction
\p
\v 7 If someone is found to have abducted a fellow Israeli to make them into a slave or to sell them, then that abductor must \add be executed\add* in order to purge such evils from \add your country\add*.\x + \xo 24:7: \xt Exo 21:16.\x*
\s1 Skin diseases
\p
\v 8 Stay on guard against a plague of skin disease. Always follow what the priests and Levites tell you all to do, as I’ve instructed them.\x + \xo 24:8: \xt Lev 13:1–14:54.\x*
\v 9 Remember what your god Yahweh did to Miryam on the way out of Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add*.\x + \xo 24:9: \xt Num 12:9-10.\x*
\p
\v 10 If you’ve lent anything to a neighbour, don’t go into their house to collect their pledge.
\v 11 \add Just\add* \add wait\add* outside, then the \add person\add* you’ve lent something to will bring the \add item\add* out to you.
\v 12 \add However,\add* if \add that person\add* is poor \add and gives clothing or a blanket as security\add*, don’t \add keep it overnight\add*.
\v 13 Take it back to them when the sun goes down so they’ll \add be warm\add* when they sleep. Then they’ll bless you and your god Yahweh \add will be pleased with\add* you.
\p
\v 14 Don’t oppress any poor or needy hired workers, whether they’re fellow Israelis or foreigners who live in your towns.\x + \xo 24:14-15: \xt Lev 19:13.\x*
\v 15 At the end of each day, pay them before sunset, because they need it to live on. Then they won’t cry out to Yahweh against you and have him \add hold you accountable\add*.
\p
\v 16 Parents mustn’t be executed for what their children have done, and children mustn’t be executed for what their parents have done. Any person must only be executed for what they themselves have done.\x + \xo 24:16: \xt 2Ki 14:6; 2Ch 25:4; Eze 18:20.\x*
\p
\v 17 Don’t pervert justice if it involves foreigners or orphans, and don’t take a widow’s cloak as security \add for a loan\add*.\x + \xo 24:17-18: \xt Exo 23:9; Lev 19:33-34; Deu 27:19.\x*
\v 18 Remember that you were a slave in Egypt and your god Yahweh \add rescued\add* you from there. \add That’s why\add* I’m commanding you to do those things—\add to be considerate about helping other people who are in need\add*.
\p
\v 19 When you \add harvest your crops\add*, if you forget a tied bundle in your field, don’t go back to get it—it’ll be for a \add resident\add* foreigner or an orphan or widow \add to pick up\add*, so that your god Yahweh can bless everything \add that you do\add*.\x + \xo 24:19-21: \xt Lev 19:9-10; 23:22.\x*
\v 20 When you beat your olive tree \add to make the fruit fall\add*, don’t go back over it to pick the ones still on the tree. Those will be for the foreigner, or the orphan or widow.
\v 21 \add Similarly,\add* when you \add pick your grapes\add* in the vineyard, don’t \add go back over the vines a second time\add*. Those will be for the foreigner, or the orphan or widow.
\v 22 \add Don’t forget\add* that you were a slave in Egypt—that’s why I’m instructing you to do those things.
\c 25
\s1 Whipping for criminals
\p
\v 1 If \add two parties have a dispute, they can request a judgement and the judges will decide who’s right and wrong\add*.
\v 2 If \add the guilty person is deserving of punishment\add*, the judge will order him to lie on the ground \add where he’ll be whipped in front of the judge as the crime deserves\add*.
\v 3 He may not \add receive more than forty lashes\add* because that would be \add too degrading\add*.
\p
\v 4 Don’t \add cover your cow’s mouth when it’s pulling the grain threshing sledge\add*.\x + \xo 25:4: \xt 1Cor 9:9; 1Tim 5:18.\x*
\s1 Continuing the family name
\p
\v 5 If some brothers live \add on the same property\add* and one of them dies without leaving a son, then the widow mustn’t marry outside \add of the family\add*. Her brother-in-law must take her as a wife for himself and \add perform the duty of\add* a brother-in-law.\x + \xo 25:5-6: \xt Mat 22:24; Mrk 12:19; Luk 20:28.\x*
\v 6 If she gives birth to a son \add in due course\add*, he’ll be considered as the son of the brother who died, so that his \add family\add* name won’t disappear from Yisrael.
\v 7 \add But if the dead man’s brother doesn’t want to marry the widow\add*, she must go to the elders at the city gate and \add explain that her brother-in-law is refusing to do his duty to preserve\add* the dead brother’s \add family\add* name in Yisrael.\x + \xo 25:7-10: \xt Rut 4:7-8.\x*
\v 8 Then those elders must summon \add the brother\add* and talk to him. \add However,\add* if he \add really\add* doesn’t want to marry her,
\v 9 then his \add late\add* brother’s wife must go up to him in front of those elders, and take his sandal off his foot and spit in his face. Then she must say, ‘That’s what happens to a man who won’t \add strengthen his brother’s family\add*.’
\v 10 \add After that,\add* the brother will be known in Yisrael as the man who had his sandal taken off.
\s1 Being fair and honest
\p
\v 11 If two men are fighting each other, and one man’s wife comes to help her husband, and reaches out and grabs the other man’s private parts,
\v 12 then you must cut her hand off. Don’t pity her.
\s1 Don’t all cheat
\p
\v 13 Don’t keep two stone \add weights\add* in your bag—a \add lighter one\add* and a \add heavier one\add* \add for when you’re buying and selling\add*.\x + \xo 25:13-16: \xt Lev 19:35-36.\x*
\v 14 Don’t keep \add two measuring containers\add* in your house—a smaller \add one\add* and a larger \add one\add*.
\v 15 You must use exact stone \add weights\add* and \add measuring containers\add* so that your god Yahweh will prolong your time in the \add country\add* that he’s giving you—
\v 16 \add he\add* \add can’t stand people who cheat others\add*.
\s1 Eliminating the Amalekites
\p
\v 17 \add Don’t forget\add* what \add the Amalekites\add* did to you \add people\add* when you came out of Egypt.\x + \xo 25:17-19: \xt Exo 17:8-14; 1Sam 15:2-9.\x*
\v 18 They met you on the road, then attacked you from behind—\add getting\add* the stragglers who were weak and exhausted. They had no fear of God.
\v 19 \add At some point in the future when\add* your god Yahweh has given you the land to occupy as an inheritance, and \add you’re no longer being attacked by your\add* enemies, you must \add eliminate the Amalekites so they won’t be remembered anymore\add*. Don’t forget \add to do that\add*.
\c 26
\s1 Offerings for the beginning of the harvest
\p
\v 1 \add After\add* you’ve entered the land that your god Yahweh is giving you as an inheritance, and you occupy it and live there,
\v 2 \add each of\add* you should take the first part of your harvest in that place and put it in a basket. Then take it to the place that your god Yahweh is going to choose to attach his name to.\x + \xo 26:2: \xt Exo 23:19.\x*
\v 3 Go to the \add high\add* priest \add in office\add* at that time, and tell him, “I declare today to your god Yahweh that I’ve entered the land that \add he\add* promised to our ancestors to give us.”
\p
\v 4 The priest will take that basket of food and place it in front of your god Yahweh’s altar.
\v 5 Then in Yahweh’s presence you should respond, “My ancestor was a wandering Aramean, and he went down to Egypt with his \add smallish family\add*, and lived there and \add eventually\add* became a large and powerful people.
\v 6 \add But\add* the Egyptians treated us badly and oppressed us—forcing us into hard labour.
\v 7 We cried out to our ancestors’ god Yahweh \add to help us\add*, and he heard our cry and saw our suffering and oppression and the \add hard\add* labour.
\v 8 Then \add using your great power\add* and \add doing many miracles and other terrifying things\add*, you brought us out from Egypt
\v 9 and brought us to this \add very fertile\add* land
\v 10 \add So now\add*, Yahweh, I’ve brought the first part of the harvest from that land that you’ve given me.”
\p Then \add as\add* the basket is placed in front of Yahweh, you must bow down in front of \add him\add*.
\v 11 Then you can celebrate \add by eating\add* all the good things that your god Yahweh has given to you and your household, and it’s \add also\add* for the Levites and the foreigners who live among you.
\p
\v 12 \add Every third year,\add* take a tenth of your harvest to the Levites, the foreigners, and the orphans and widows \add in your town\add* for them to eat and be content.\x + \xo 26:12: \xt Deu 14:28-29.\x*
\v 13 Then you must explain in front of your god Yahweh, “I’ve taken the sacred \add tenth\add* from my house and given it to the Levites, the foreigners, the orphans and widows, \add thus following all of your instructions\add*. I’ve not disobeyed or forgotten your regulations.
\v 14 I never used any of it at a funeral, or took it \add in disobedience\add*, or offered it to the dead. I’ve listen to the voice of my god Yahweh and \add followed all your instructions\add*,
\v 15 \add so\add* look down from your sacred home in the heavens and bless your people Yisrael and the land that you’ve given us \add that’s so fertile\add*, as you had promised our ancestors.
\p
\v 16 Today your god Yahweh is commanding you to follow all these instructions and regulations, so follow them \add sincerely and enthusiastically\add*.
\v 17 You have declared today that Yahweh is your god, and that you’ll follow all his instructions and keep his regulations and commands and rules, and listen to his voice.
\v 18 \add Also\add* today, Yahweh has declared that you are his people, like a \add prized\add* possession, like he told you that you would be. You must follow all his instructions\x + \xo 26:18: \xt Exo 19:5; Deu 4:20; 7:6; 14:2; Tit 2:14; 1Pe 2:9.\x*
\v 19 and then he’ll make \add your country\add* greater than all the others that he’s \add established\add*. You’ll be praised for your reputation and beauty, and you’ll be different from the others—being a sacred people for your god Yahweh, just like he’s said.
\c 27
\s1 The warnings of not still entering of Kanaan
\p
\v 1 Then Mosheh \add (Moses)\add* and the Israeli elders commanded the people, “Follow all the \add instructions\add* that I’m \add giving\add* you today.
\v 2 When you cross the Yarden \add river\add* to enter the land that your god Yahweh is giving you, then you must \add stand up some tall pieces of rock\add* and cover them with plaster.\x + \xo 27:2-8: \xt Josh 8:30-32.\x*
\v 3 Then write all these instructions onto them as soon as you’ve crossed the river, so that you can enter the \add very fertile\add* land that your god Yahweh is giving you, as he had \add promised\add* your ancestors.
\v 4 Then after you’ve \add gone further in\add*, \add stand some tall pieces of rock up on end\add* on Mt. Ebal like I’ve told you, and cover them with plaster,
\v 5 and build a stone altar there \add to offer sacrifices\add* to your god Yahweh. Don’t use any iron tools \add to shape\add* the stones.\x + \xo 27:5-6: \xt Exo 20:25.\x*
\v 6 You must built Yahweh’s altar with uncut stones. Then you can offer burnt sacrifices to your god Yahweh on it.
\v 7 \add Also,\add* you can sacrifice peace offerings and cheerfully eat them there in front of your god Yahweh.
\v 8 When you write these instructions on those stones, you must write them very clearly.
\p
\v 9 Then Mosheh \add (Mosheh)\add* along with the priests and the Levites, spoke to all Yisrael, “Be silent and listen, Yisrael. Today you have become the people of your god Yahweh.
\v 10 \add So\add* \add from now on\add*, you must \add listen to what he says\add* and follow all the instructions and rules that I’m giving you today.”
\s1 Curses for disobedience
\p
\v 11 That \add same\add* day, Mosheh told the people,
\v 12 “After you’ve all crossed the Yarden \add river\add*, the tribes of Simeon, Levi, Yehudah, Yissaskar, Yosef, and Benyamin must stand on Mt. Gerizim and bless the people.\x + \xo 27:12: \xt Deu 11:29; Josh 8:33-35.\x*
\v 13 \add Meanwhile,\add* the tribes of Reuven, Gad, Asher, Zevulun, Dan, and Naftali must stand on Mt. Ebal \add to hear\add* the curse.
\p
\v 14 Then the Levites will call out loudly to tell \add every\add* Israeli:
\p
\v 15 ‘\add Anyone\add* who makes a figure, whether carved \add from wood\add* or cast \add from metal\add*, and secretly sets it up \add to worship\add* will be cursed \add because\add* Yahweh abhors it.’\x + \xo 27:15: \xt Exo 20:4; 34:17; Lev 19:4; 26:1; Deu 4:15-18; 5:8.\x*
\p Then the people must reply, ‘Let it be so.’
\p
\v 16 ‘\add Anyone\add* who dishonours their father or mother will be cursed.’
\p Then the people must reply, ‘Let it be so.’
\p
\v 17 ‘\add Anyone\add* who moves their boundary marker \add back into\add* their neighbour’s \add property\add* will be cursed.’
\p Then the people must reply, ‘Let it be so.’
\p
\v 18 ‘\add Anyone\add* who leads a blind person down the wrong path will be cursed.’
\p Then the people must reply, ‘Let it be so.’
\p
\v 19 ‘\add Anyone\add* who perverts justice for a foreigner or orphan or widow will be cursed.’\x + \xo 27:19: \xt Exo 22:21; 23:9; Lev 19:33-34; Deu 24:17-18.\x*
\p Then the people must reply, ‘Let it be so.’
\p
\v 20 ‘\add Any man\add* who sleeps with a wife of his father will be cursed because \add he’s exposed his father’s nakedness\add*.’
\p Then the people must reply, ‘Let it be so.’
\p
\v 21 ‘\add Anyone\add* who has sex with an animal will be cursed.’

\p
\v 22 ‘\add Any male\add* who sleeps with his sister \add or his half sister\add* will be cursed.’

\p Then the people must reply, ‘Let it be so.’
\p
\v 26 ‘\add Anyone\add* who doesn’t \add follow all these instructions\add* will be cursed.’\x + \xo 27:26: \xt Gal 3:10.\x*
\p Then the people must reply, ‘Let it be so.’
\c 28
\s1 Blessings for obedience
\r (Lev. 26:3-13; Deu. 7:12-24)
\p
\v 1 If you, \add Yisrael,\add* listen to \add what god Yahweh says\add* and follow all his instructions that I’m giving you today, then \add he\add* will make you the greatest of all the nations \add in the world\add*,\x + \xo 28:1-14: \xt Deu 11:13-17.\x*
\v 2 and all these blessings will come to you if you listen to \add his\add* voice:
\p
\v 3 You’ll be blessed in the city, and blessed in the countryside.
\p
\v 4 Your \add children\add*, your \add harvests\add*, and your \add calves, and lambs and kids\add* will \add all\add* be blessed.
\p
\v 5 Your basket and your kneading bowl will be blessed.
\p
\v 6 You’ll be blessed when you’re coming in and when you’re going out.
\p
\v 7 Yahweh \add will enable you to defeat\add* your enemies who come to attack you—they’ll \add march in all orderly, but\add* will flee from you in \add all\add* directions.
\p
\v 8 Yahweh will decree a blessing on your barns and on all \add the work you do\add*, and he’ll bless you in the land that \add he’s\add* giving to you.
\p
\v 9 If you follow your God Yahweh’s instructions and \add do what he wants\add*, \add he\add* will establish you as his sacred people just like he promised.
\v 10 Then all the peoples \add around the world\add* will realise that Yahweh’s name is \add attached to\add* you, and they’ll be afraid of you.
\v 11 Yahweh will help you to really prosper through your children, your animals, and your harvests in the land that \add he\add* promised to your ancestors that he’d give to you.
\v 12 Yahweh will open his treasure \add house\add* in the sky and send good rain \add when it’s needed\add* and bless \add everything you do\add*, \add so that\add* you’ll lend \add money\add* to many nations instead of needing to borrow it.
\v 13 Yahweh will make you the head, not the tail. You’ll be above, not beneath, if you listen to your god Yahweh’s instructions that I’m giving you today, and \add follow them\add*
\v 14 \add Make sure you\add* don’t turn away from those instructions, and never \add worship\add* other gods.
\s1 Curses for disobedience
\r (Lev. 26:14-46)
\p
\v 15 \add On the other hand,\add* if you don’t listen to your god Yahweh’s voice and keep following his instructions and obeying his rules that I’m giving you today, then all these curses will \add catch up to you and hit\add* you:
\p
\v 16 You’ll be cursed in the city and cursed in the countryside.
\p
\v 17 Your basket and your kneading bowl will be cursed.
\p
\v 18 Your \add children\add*, your \add harvests\add*, and your \add calves, and lambs and kids\add* will \add all\add* be cursed.
\p
\v 19 You’ll be cursed when you’re coming in and when you’re going out.
\s1 The curses of repentance from God
\p
\v 20 Yahweh will send curses against you, and confusion and opposition in \add everything your country does\add* until you’re destroyed and quickly \add eliminated\add* because of your evil activities that \add demonstrate that\add* you’ve abandoned me.
\v 21 Yahweh will make the plague cling to you until he’s finished you from off the land that you’re about to enter and \add take ownership of\add*.
\v 22 Yahweh will send \add cancer\add* and fever and inflammation. There’ll be fiery heat and drought, and blight and mildew, and will chase you until you \add die\add*.
\v 23 The overhead sky \add will be locked up\add* like bronze, and \add the dryness will make\add* the land like iron.
\v 24 \add Instead of\add* rain on your land, Yahweh will send powdered dust that will cover you until \add your country\add* is destroyed.
\p
\v 25 Yahweh \add will allow your enemies to destroy you\add*—your army will \add march in all orderly, but\add* will flee from you in \add all\add* directions, and all \add the other countries in the world will be horrified at what happens to\add* you.
\v 26 Your corpses will become food for birds and wild animals, and there’ll be no one \add left\add* to \add scare them away\add*.
\v 27 Yahweh will afflict you with boils \add like he sent to the Egyptian people\add*, along with ulcers, rashes, and itching which \add there’s no cure for\add*.
\v 28 Yahweh will strike you with madness and blindness, and with \add confused minds\add*.
\v 29 \add Even in the middle of the day,\add* you’ll be groping around like blind people, and your projects won’t be successful. You’ll be oppressed and robbed continually, and there’ll be no one to rescue you.
\p
\v 30 \add A man\add* will be engaged to a young woman, but someone else will rape her. You’ll build a house, but never get to live in it, and you’ll plant a vineyard, \add but not get to produce any wine\add*.
\v 31 Your cow will be slaughtered right in front of your eyes, but you won’t get to eat any of it. You donkey will be stolen \add right in front of you\add*, but will \add never\add* be returned. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, but no one will help you rescue them.
\v 32 Your sons and daughters will be handed over to another country, and you’ll strain your eyes all day looking for them, but you won’t be able to do anything about it.
\v 33 People from a country you’ve never heard of will harvest your crops and \add enjoy the results of\add* your work, but you’ll just be oppressed and crushed.
\v 34 \add All the things you witness will drive you to insanity\add*.
\v 35 Yahweh will strike your \add people\add* with bad boils on your knees and legs that will never heal up—from the bottom of your soles right up to the tops of your heads.
\p
\v 36 Yahweh will lead you and the king that you’ll place over you, to a country that you and your ancestors have never been to, and you’ll \add end up\add* serving other gods there made of wood or stone.
\v 37 Those people in the countries that Yahweh will push you into will be horrified about you, and create sayings and jokes about you.
\p
\v 38 You’ll \add plant a lot of seed in your fields, but\add* only gather a small \add harvest\add* because locusts will eat the crops.
\v 39 You’ll plant vineyards and cultivate them, but you won’t harvest the grapes or drink the wine, because worms will eat them.
\v 40 You’ll have olive trees across your territory, but you won’t have any oil to \add rub on your skin\add*, because the \add unripe\add* olives will drop off \add the trees\add*.
\v 41 You’ll have sons and daughters, \add but you won’t be able to keep them\add* because they’ll be \add taken away as captives\add*.
\v 42 \add Swarms of\add* crickets will take over your trees and \add plants\add*.
\p
\v 43 The foreigners who live among you will become \add more and more powerful\add* and you’ll become \add less and less powerful\add*.
\v 44 They’ll lend to you, not you lending to them. The foreigner will be the head and you’ll be the tail.
\p
\v 45 All those curses will come on you and chase and overtake you until you’re destroyed because \add your country\add* didn’t listen to the voice of your god Yahweh, or follow his instructions, or obey the rules that he \add gave\add* you.
\v 46 \add Those curses\add* will afflict you and your descendants forever as signs
\v 47 because you didn’t serve your god Yahweh with cheerfulness \add resulting\add* from the abundance \add that you took for granted\add*.
\v 48 \add So then,\add* Yahweh will send enemies against you and you’ll serve them in hunger and thirst, and in nakedness and lacking everything. \add Yahweh\add* will put an iron yoke on your neck \add used for pulling heavy loads with,\add* until he destroys you.
\v 49 Yahweh will send a very distant nation against you. They’ll \add swoop in\add* like an eagle—speaking a language that you won’t understand.
\v 50 They’ll be fierce \add looking\add* and with \add no mercy\add* for either the elderly or the young.
\v 51 They’ll eat \add the meat of\add* your animals and the harvests from your crops until you’re destroyed. They won’t leave any grain or new wine, or calves, lambs, or kids—you’ll all \add die\add* \add of hunger\add*.
\v 52 They’ll surround all your cities until your high, fortified walls that you trusted in come down all over your country. \add Yes,\add* you’ll be \add contained\add* inside your cities throughout the land the your god Yahweh has given you.
\p
\v 53 Due to that siege and the distress that you experience from the oppression of your enemies, you’ll \add end up\add* eating the flesh of the sons and daughters that your god Yahweh has given you.
\v 54 Even the most sensitive, kind-hearted man among you will \add be selfish\add* towards his brother, towards the wife \add that he loves\add*, and towards his own remaining children—
\v 55 withholding from them, the flesh of his children that he’ll eat, in his distress as he has nothing else left due to that siege and the oppression from your enemies that have surrounded your cities.
\v 56 Even the most delicate, tender woman among you \add who never once stepped outside the house in her bare feet\add*, will \add be selfish\add* towards the husband \add that she loves\add* and to her own son and her own daughter—\x + \xo 28:57: \xt 2Ki 6:28-29; Lam 4:10.\x*
\v 57 eating \add both\add* her new baby and the placenta, in her distress as she has nothing else left due to that siege and the oppression from your enemies that have surrounded your cities.
\p
\v 58 If you don’t keep following all the instructions that are written in this book, i.e., not \add honouring and showing respect\add* to your incredible god Yahweh,
\v 59 then \add he’ll\add* punish you by sending terrible plagues to you and your descendants, along with long-lasting illnesses.
\v 60 All the plagues that he sent onto the Egyptians and which terrified you, he’ll send them onto you \add now\add* and they’ll cling to you.
\v 61 Every kind of sickness and disease that isn’t \add even\add* written in this book, Yahweh will send them \add all\add* onto you until you’re destroyed.
\v 62 Even though you all had been as numerous as the stars in the sky, \add your country\add* will be left underpopulated because you didn’t listen to your god Yahweh’s voice.
\v 63 Just as Yahweh was happy to do good things for you and multiply you all, he would then be happy to to bring you all to ruin and destruction. Then you’ll be torn away from the land that you’re going in to \add take ownership of\add*.
\p
\v 64 Yahweh will scatter you among all the peoples \add right around the world\add* where you’ll serve gods made out of wood or stone that neither you nor your ancestors \add had heard of\add*.
\v 65 You won’t have any peace among those nations, and \add you’ll never be able to relax\add*, but rather Yahweh will give you trembling hearts, sore eyes, and \add minds full of despair\add*.
\v 66 \add Time will go very slowly for you\add*, and you’ll be scared both night and day, \add without any certainty in your life\add*.
\v 67 In the morning you’ll say, ‘If only it was evening,’ and in the evening you’ll say, ‘If only it was morning,’ because of the continual tightness in your stomach and because of the sights \add you’ll have to witness\add*.
\v 68 Yahweh will send \add some of\add* you back to Egypt by ship, even though I’d told you that you’ll never see that country again. Then you’ll be offered there for sale as slaves, but no one will \add want to\add* buy you.
\c 29
\p
\v 1 Those are the words of the agreement that Yahweh commanded Mosheh to \add make\add* with the \add Israelis\add* there in Moav, on top of the agreement that he’d \add made\add* with them at Horeb \add (Mt. Sinai)\add*.
\s1 Overview of the agreement
\p
\v 2 Then Mosheh \add (Moses)\add* called all Yisrael together and told them, “You’ve all seen everything that Yahweh did to Far-oh and all his servants in Egypt and \add what he did\add* to all his country \add right in front of\add* your eyes—
\v 3 the sufferings \add of the people there\add* that you saw for yourselves, along with the incredible miracles,
\v 4 \add yet up until now\add*, Yahweh hasn’t enabled you all to understand the meaning of everything that you saw and heard.
\v 5 For forty years, \add Yahweh\add* led you all in the wilderness, \add but\add* your clothes didn’t wear through, and the sandals on your feet never wore out.
\v 6 You all \add survived without\add* bread to eat or any wine or alcohol to drink so that you’d realise that I am your god Yahweh.
\v 7 Then when we arrived here, King Sihon from Heshbon and King Og from Bashan came out \add to battle\add* against us, \add but we defeated them\add*.\x + \xo 29:7: a \xt Num 21:21-30; \xo b \xt Num 21:31-35.\x*
\v 8 We took their land and gave it to the tribes of Rueven and Gad, and the half-tribe of Menashsheh to become their inheritance.\x + \xo 29:8: \xt Num 32:33.\x*
\v 9 \add So\add* follow all the instructions in this agreement and obey the rules so that you’ll all prosper in everything you do.
\p
\v 10 All of you stand \add here\add* today \add in front\add* of your god Yahweh: your chiefs, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, all the Israeli men
\v 11 along with your wives and children, and the foreigners \add living\add* among you (who cut wood and fetch water for you),
\v 12 to enter into an agreement with your god Yahweh, and to \add accept\add* the promise that \add he’s made to\add* you today.
\v 13 That will establish \add your country\add* as his people, and he will be your god as he told you he would, having promised \add it\add* to your ancestors Abraham, Yitshak, and Yakov.
\v 14 This agreement isn’t just with all of you here today,
\v 15 the ones standing here, \add but also\add* with those who aren’t here with you today.
\p
\v 16 You all know how we lived in Egypt, and then travelled through other \add kingdoms\add* on our way \add here\add*,
\v 17 and you’ve all seen their disgusting practices and the idols that they had, made of wood and stone, gold and silver.
\v 18 If there happens to be a man or woman, or clan or tribe, whose \add loyalty\add* is turning away today from your god Yahweh and to go and serve those gods in those other nations, i.e., if there’s a \add bitter or poisonous root\add* among you all,\x + \xo 29:18: \xt Heb 12:15.\x*
\v 19 and if they hear the words of this curse, then they’ll think to themselves, ‘We’ll have peace, even though \add our minds are fixed on where we’re going\add*,’ so that the \add good and the bad are carried along together\add*,
\v 20 Yahweh won’t be willing to forgive them. \add No,\add* his jealousy and anger will rage against them, and all the curses written in this book will land on them, and Yahweh will wipe out their name \add never to be remembered again\add*.
\v 21 Then Yahweh will single out that person \add or group\add* from all of Yisrael’s tribe, to be marked out for disaster as per all the curses that are written in this book of instructions.
\p
\v 22 Then a future generation (your descendants who’ll be born in the future, plus the foreigner who comes from a distant land), when they see the plagues \add that hit\add* that land and the diseases that Yahweh \add sent to\add* make it sick, will say,
\v 23 ‘All that land is sulfur and burning salt. No one plants anything and nothing sprouts, and not even grass grows in it, like the overthrow of Sodom and Amorah \add (Gomorrah)\add*, Admah and Tsevoim, which Yahweh destroyed in his rage and anger,’\x + \xo 29:23: \xt Gen 19:24-25.\x*
\v 24 and all the nations will \add ask\add*, ‘Why did Yahweh do that to that country? What’s \add he so angry about\add*?’
\v 25 Then \add others will reply\add*, ‘Because they neglected their agreement with Yahweh, the god of their ancestors, that he \add made\add* with them when he brought them out from Egypt,
\v 26 and they went and served other gods and bowed down to them—gods that they hadn’t \add heard of before or had anything to do with\add*.
\v 27 That’s why Yahweh was angry at that country and brought all the curses written in this book onto it—
\v 28 tearing them away from their land \add in his raging anger\add*, and threw them into another land as \add we can see\add* today.’
\p
\v 29 Our god Yahweh \add has his secrets\add*, \add but what he’s revealed\add* is for us and our children forever, so that we can follow all his instructions.
\c 30
\s1 Opportunity for restoration
\p
\v 1 If you’ve \add experienced\add* the blessings, and then the curses that I’ve \add told you about\add*, but then you \add have a change of\add* heart \add there\add* among all the nations that your god Yahweh has \add scattered\add* you \add across\add*,
\v 2 and you and your children \add decide to\add* return to your god Yahweh and listen to his voice, and \add sincerely and diligently follow everything\add* that I’m commanding you today,
\v 3 then your god Yahweh will show compassion towards you and reverse your captivity, and he’ll gather you from all the peoples where \add he’s\add* scattered you, and return you.
\v 4 Even if your scattered people are at the ends of the \add earth\add*, your god Yahweh would gather you from there and bring you back \add to your country\add*.
\v 5 Your god Yahweh would then bring you back into the country of your fathers, and you’d retake possession of it, and then he’d \add cause you to become more prosperous and more numerous than you are now\add*.
\v 6 \add He\add* will ‘circumcise the heart of’ \add (remove the evil motives from)\add* you and your children \add to release you\add* to love your god Yahweh with total sincerity and diligently, so that you can live.
\v 7 Then \add he\add* will put all those curses on your enemies and those who hate you and who oppressed you.
\v 8 \add After that\add*, you’ll turn and listen to Yahweh’s voice and follow all his instructions that I’m giving you today.
\v 9 Your god Yahweh will give you prosperity in \add everything you work on\add*, and \add in producing children\add*, and \add expanding your herds\add* and \add harvesting your crops\add*. \add He’ll\add* \add happily cause you to prosper just like he’d done\add* for your fathers,
\v 10 if you listen to \add his\add* voice, following his instructions and obeying his rules written in this book, i.e., if you return to your god Yahweh your God with \add total sincerity\add* and with all your \add energy\add*.
\s1 Yahweh’s instructions aren’t a distant dream
\p
\v 11 These instructions that I’m giving you today aren’t too difficult or \add impractical\add* for you—
\v 12 it’s not like you have to send someone up to heaven to get them so you can hear them and follow them.\x + \xo 30:12-14: \xt Rom 10:6-8.\x*
\v 13 Nor are they on the opposite side of the ocean such that you have to find someone to cross over to get them so you can hear them and follow them.
\v 14 \add On the contrary,\add* these instructions are very close to you—you \add should discuss them and think about them\add* so that you can follow them.
\s1 The selection of life
\p
\v 15 Listen, I’ve placed \add the choice between\add* life and good, and death and evil, in front of you today.
\v 16 What I’m commanding you today is to love your god Yahweh, to walk in his ways and to follow his instructions and \add obey\add* his rules and regulations, and then you’ll live and multiply, and your god Yahweh will bless you in the land that you’re about to \add take possession of\add*.
\v 17 But if your \add loyalty shifts\add* away and you don’t listen \add but instead\add* you’re drawn away and bow down to other gods and serve them,
\v 18 \add then\add* I’m warning you all today that you’ll all \add most certainly\add* die, i.e., you won’t live for a long time in the land which you’re about to cross the Yarden \add river\add* to \add take possession of\add*.
\v 19 I call on the heavens and the earth to witness against you today: I’ve \add placed in front of you\add* \add the choice between\add* life and death, \add and between\add* blessings and the curses, so that you’ll \add be forced\add* to choose life so that you and your descendants will live.
\v 20 \add Decide today\add* to love your god Yahweh, to listen to his voice, and to cling to him, because he’ll \add give\add* you life and \add lengthen\add* your \add lives\add* so you can live in the land that Yahweh promised to give to your fathers, Abraham, Yitshak, and Yakov.\x + \xo 30:20: a \xt Gen 12:7; \xo b \xt Gen 26:3; \xo c \xt Gen 28:13.\x*
\c 31
\s1 Yehoshua (Joshua) installed as the new leader
\s4 Promised land
\p
\v 1 Then Mosheh \add (Moses)\add* also told the Israelis,
\v 2 “I’m already a hundred and twenty and no longer able to \add walk around easily\add*, plus Yahweh has told me that I won’t be able to cross the Yarden \add (Jordan)\add* \add river\add*.\x + \xo 31:2: \xt Num 20:12.\x*
\v 3 Your god Yahweh \add will go ahead of you\add* and destroy those peoples \add right in front of your eyes\add*, then you’ll be able to take over that land. Yahweh has said that it’s Yehoshua \add (Joshua)\add* who will \add lead you in\add* \add there\add*.
\v 4 Then Yahweh will do the same to \add those peoples\add* as he did to the Amorite kings Sihon and Og, when he destroyed them and their \add people\add*.\x + \xo 31:4: \xt Num 21:21-35.\x*
\v 5 Yahweh will \add enable you to conquer those peoples\add*, but you must do exactly what I’ve instructed you, to them.
\v 6 Be strong and courageous. Don’t be afraid or scared of \add those people\add*, because it’s your god Yahweh who’ll go with you—he won’t leave you or abandon you.
\p
\v 7 Then Mosheh called Yehoshua and told him \add in front of\add* all Yisrael, “Be strong and courageous, because you’ll go with these people into the land that Yahweh had promised to their ancestors to give to them, and you’ll \add enable\add* them to \add take it as their inheritance\add*.
\v 8 Yahweh will go \add ahead of you\add* \add and\add* he’ll be with you. He won’t fail or abandon you—you mustn’t be afraid or concerned.\x + \xo 31:8: \xt Josh 1:5; Heb 13:5.\x*
\s1 Listening to these instructions every seven years
\p
\v 9 Then Mosheh wrote these instructions down and gave \add the scroll\add* to the Israeli elders and to the priests (Levi’s descendants) who carry the box containing Yahweh’s agreement.
\v 10 Then Mosheh instructed them: Every seven years at the time for cancelling all debts during the Celebration in Huts,\x + \xo 31:10: a \xt Deu 15:1-2; \xo b \xt Deu 16:13-15.\x*
\v 11 when all Yisrael \add must go and stand in front\add* of your god Yahweh in the place that he will choose, you must read these instructions \add aloud\add* to all Yisrael.
\v 12 Assemble the people (men, women, children, and any foreigners that live in your \add country\add*) so that they can listen and learn, and \add honour and respect\add* your god Yahweh, and keep following all these instructions.
\v 13 Then their descendants who won’t have heard this yet, can hear them and learn to \add honour and respect\add* your god Yahweh \add during all the years\add* that you all live in the land that you are crossing the Yarden \add river\add* in order to \add take possession of it\add*.
\s1 The final command to Mosheh
\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh told Mosheh \add (Moses)\add*, “Listen, you’ll soon die. Call Yehoshua \add (Joshua)\add* present yourselves in the sacred tent, then I’ll give him his instructions.”
\p \add So\add* Mosheh and Yehoshua went to the sacred tent.
\v 15 Yahweh appeared \add to them\add* \add there\add* in a pillar of cloud that stood over the tent door.
\p
\v 16 Then Yahweh said to Mosheh, “Listen, you’ll \add soon\add* \add go to join\add* your ancestors, and these people will \add turn\add* and \add prostitute themselves to\add* the strange gods of the land that they’ll be going to. \add This nation\add* will abandon me and break the agreement that I’ve made with it.
\v 17 \add When that happens\add*, my \add rage\add* will burn against them, and I’ll abandon them and \add distance myself\add* from them. They’ll be devoured \add by other kingdoms\add*, and many disasters and troubles will \add hit\add* them. Then they’ll say \add at that time\add*, ‘Didn’t these disasters \add come to\add* us because our God is \add no longer here amongst us\add*?’
\v 18 \add Yes,\add* I’ll definitely \add stay away\add* on that day because of all the evil that they will have done when they turned to other gods.
\v 19 \add So\add* now, write down this song and teach it to the Israelis. \add Make them memorise it\add* so that it can become a witness for me against \add them\add*.
\v 20 When I bring them to the land that I promised to their ancestors, flowing with milk and honey, and they eat \add well\add* and become satisfied and fat, then they’ll turn to other gods and they’ll serve them, and they’ll despise me and break \add our\add* agreement.
\v 21 \add Then in the future\add* when many evils and troubles \add hit\add* \add the country\add*, this song will testify to it as a witness (because it won’t be forgotten by their descendants). Because I know their intent today, \add even\add* before I’ve taken them into the land that I promised.”
\p
\v 22 \add So\add* Mosheh wrote down the song that day and taught it to the \add Israelis\add*.
\p
\v 23 Then he instructed Nun’s son Yehoshua \add (Joshua)\add*, “Be strong and courageous; because you’ll be the one to take the \add Israelis\add* into the land that I promised them, and I’ll be with you.”\x + \xo 31:23: \xt Num 27:23; Jam 1:6.\x*
\p
\v 24 \add After\add* Mosheh had finished writing all these instructions \add from beginning\add* to end onto a scroll,
\v 25 he told the Levites who carry the box containing Yahweh’s agreement,
\v 26 “Take this scroll with these instructions \add on it\add* and place it beside the box containing your god Yahweh’s agreement, and then it’ll be there as a witness against \add your nation\add*
\v 27 because I know your rebellion and \add stubbornness\add*. Listen while I’m still alive with you today: you’ve all been rebellious against Yahweh, and it’ll surely \add be worse\add* after my death.
\v 28 Bring all the elders and officials of your tribes here to me, so that I can speak these words in their ears and call the heavens and the earth to witness against them,
\v 29 because I know that after my death, you’ll certainly corrupt yourselves and turn away from the ways that I have instructed you, and disaster will come to you in the future, because you’ll all do evil in Yahweh’s eyes, provoking him to anger \add by what you all do\add*.”
\s1 Mosheh’s song
\p
\v 30 Then Moses \add recited this entire song aloud to all the gathered Israelis\add*:
\c 32
\p
\v 1 “\add Listen you\add* heavens, and let me speak,
\q1 and let the earth listen to \add what I have to say\add*.
\q1
\v 2 Let my teaching drop like rain,
\q1 my speech drip like dew,
\q1 like sprinkling on the grass,
\q1 and like showers on the plants,
\q1
\v 3 because I declare Yahweh’s name.
\q1 \add Tell God how great he is\add*.
\q1
\v 4 The Rock, his work is perfect,
\q1 because all his ways are \add fair and honest\add*—
\q1 a faithful God \add who never does wrong\add*.
\q1 He’s \add always honest and always correct\add*.
\q1
\v 5 \add Yisrael\add* acted corruptly towards him—
\q1 they’re not his children, that’s their flaw.
\q1 They’re a perverse and crooked generation.
\q1
\v 6 Is that how you reward Yahweh,
\q1 you foolish people and without wisdom?
\q1 Isn’t he your father, your creator?
\q1 He made you and established you.
\q1
\v 7 Remember the days of old.
\q1 Consider generation after generation over the years.
\q1 Ask your father and he’ll inform you.
\q1 \add Question\add* your elders and they’ll tell you.
\q1
\v 8 When the highest one gave the nations an inheritance,
\q1 when he \add spread all humans out\add*,
\q1 he defined the boundaries for the peoples,
\q1 according to the number of \add Israelis\add*,\x + \xo 32:8: \xt Acts 17:26.\x*
\q1
\v 9 because Yahweh’s allocation is his people.
\q1 Yakov \add (Jacob)\add* is the portion of his inheritance.
\q1
\v 10 He found him in a land that was just wilderness,
\q1 and in the barren, howling desert.
\q1 He surrounded him and looked after him—
\q1 watched over him \add like a precious possession\add*.
\q1
\v 11 Like an eagle stirs up its nest,
\q1 hovering over its young.
\q1 He spread his wings, then took him—
\q1 \add sitting him on top of his feathers\add*.
\q1
\v 12 Yahweh alone led \add Yisrael\add*,
\q1 ^and there wasn’t any foreign god helping them.
\q1
\v 13 He \add helped Yisrael reach the hilltops\add*,
\q1 and fed them the fruits of the countryside.
\q1 He nourished them with honey from the cliffs,
\q1 oil from the \add hardest rocks\add*,
\q1
\v 14 yogurt from the cattle and milk from the flocks,
\q1 with fat of lambs, and rams from Bashan, and goats,
\q1 with plump wheat kernels,
\q1 and the juice of grapes that you drank as wine.
\q1
\v 15 \add So the good fellow\add* got fat and kicked—
\q1 you were fat, getting bloated, you gorged.
\q1 Then he abandoned the God who created him,
\q1 and he rejected the rock \add that had saved him\add*.
\q1
\v 16 \add Yisrael\add* provoked him with strange \add gods\add*.
\q1 They anger him with their abominations.
\q1
\v 17 They sacrificed to demons, not God—
\q1 gods they hadn’t known.
\q1 New ones that had come recently,
\q1 that your ancestor had never \add served\add*.
\q1
\v 18 You neglected the rock \add who carried you\add*,
\q1 and you forgot God who gave birth to you.
\q1
\v 19 Yahweh noticed that and he rejected \add you\add*,
\q1 due to that provocation by his sons and daughters.
\q1
\v 20 He said, ‘Let me hide myself from them,
\q1 I’ll \add just watch how they end up\add*
\q1 because they’re a perverse generation—
\q1 children \add who totally lack faithfulness\add*.
\q1
\v 21 They provoked me with a non-god—
\q1 angered me by their worthless idols,
\q1 so I’ll provoke them with a ‘non-people’.
\q1 I’ll anger them by means of a foolish nation,\x + \xo 32:21: a \xt 1Cor 10:22; \xo b \xt Rom 10:19.\x*
\q1
\v 22 because \add my anger flames like\add* a fire.
\q1 It burns \add down\add* to the lowest grave,
\q1 and devours the land and its harvests,
\q1 and scorches the foundations of the mountains.
\q1
\v 23 I’ll send them even more disasters.
\q1 I’ll use my arrows up on them.
\q1
\v 24 They’ll be wasted by hunger
\q1 and weakened by plague and terrible contagious diseases.
\q1 I’ll send \add those diseases\add* on the teeth of wild animals,
\q1 along with the poison from \add various\add* creatures that crawl in the dust.
\q1
\v 25 Outside the sword will leave people dead,
\q1 and inside, in the bedrooms, there’ll be terror,
\q1 \add whether it’s for\add* a young man or young woman,
\q1 or the baby or the gray-haired man.
\q1
\v 26 I said I’d wipe them out—
\q1 I would remove their memory from humankind
\q1
\v 27 if \add it wasn’t for the fact that I expect that their enemies would boast\add*.
\q1 \add I don’t want\add* their adversaries to misjudge,
\q1 saying, “\add It’s us who’s powerful\add*,
\q1 and Yahweh didn’t carry all this out.” ’
\q1
\v 28 because they’re a nation \add short of good advice\add*,
\q1 and \add lacking in\add* understanding.
\q1
\v 29 If they were wise, they’d comprehend this.
\q1 They’d understand \add what was ahead of them\add*.
\q1
\v 30 How could one \add warrior\add* chase a thousand \add Israelis\add*,
\q1 or two put ten thousands to flight,
\q1 unless their ‘rock’ sold them,
\q1 and Yahweh gave them up?
\q1
\v 31 Even our enemies know
\q1 that their \add protector/\add*‘rock’ is not like ours,
\q1
\v 32 because their vine \add has its roots in\add* Sodom,
\q1 and \add comes\add* from the vineyards of Gomorrah.
\q1 Their grapes are \add full\add* of poison—
\q1 their clusters \add of grapes taste bitter\add*.
\q1
\v 33 Their wine is snake venom,
\q1 and the deadly poison of vipers.
\q1
\v 34 ‘Aren’t these \add future events\add* \add my secret\add*—
\q1 sealed up in my treasure-houses?
\q1
\v 35 Vengeance and recompense belong to me
\q1 at the time when their foot slips,
\q1 because the day of their disaster is close,
\q1 and the things prepared for them hurry along.’\x + \xo 32:35: \xt Rom 12:19; Heb 10:30.\x*
\q1
\v 36 \add Yes,\add* Yahweh vindicates his people,
\q1 and has compassion on his servants,
\q1 because he’ll see that their \add power\add* is gone,
\q1 and no one \add remains\add*, either free or \add enslaved\add*.\x + \xo 32:36a: \xt Psa 135:14.\x*
\q1
\v 37 Then he’ll \add ask\add*, ‘Where are their gods—
\q1 the rock who they \add went to to be safe\add*,
\q1
\v 38 who ate the fat of their sacrifices,
\q1 \add and\add* drank the wine \add that they’d offered\add*?
\q1 Let \add those gods\add* \add take action\add* and help you.
\q1 Let them be a shelter over you.
\q1
\v 39 Now \add you’ll realise that I’m God\add*,
\q1 and that there’s no god other than me.
\q1 I put to death and give life.
\q1 I wound, and I heal,
\q1 and no one \add can challenge my power\add*,
\q1
\v 40 because I lift my hand up to heaven
\q1 and \add promise\add*, “As I live forever,
\q2
\v 41 when I sharpen my glittering sword,
\q1 and \add prepare to apply\add* justice,
\q1 I will return vengeance on my enemies,
\q1 and I’ll pay back those who hate me.
\q1
\v 42 I’ll make my arrows drunk with blood,
\q1 and my sword will devour flesh,
\q1 with the blood of those slaughtered and the captives—
\q1 from the heads of the enemy’s leaders.” ’
\q1
\v 43 \add You\add* nations, \add need to appreciate\add* his people,
\q1 because he’ll avenge the blood of his servants,
\q1 and he’ll return vengeance onto his enemies,
\q1 and then he’ll \add forgive\add* his country—his people.”
\p
\v 44 Then Mosheh, accompanied by Nun’s son Yehoshua, went and \add recited\add* all the words of that song \add for the people to hear\add*.
\s1 Mosheh’s final instructions
\p
\v 45 \add When\add* Mosheh had finished telling all that to all Yisrael,
\v 46 he told them, “\add Never forget\add* all those instructions that I’ve been giving you today. \add Teach them\add* to your children so that they’ll be able to keep following them,
\v 47 because it’s no \add light matter\add* for you all. \add Yes,\add* it’s your lives, and \add by doing that\add* you can prolong your \add time\add* in the land which you are crossing over the Yarden \add river\add* to \add take possession of\add*.”
\p
\v 48 That same day, Yahweh told Mosheh,\x + \xo 32:48-52: \xt Num 27:12-14; Deu 3:23-27.\x*
\v 49 “Go to Mt. Nebo (a mountain in the Abarim \add range\add* in Moav, \add across from\add* Yeriho). Climb up and you will see the land of Canaan, which I’m giving to the \add Israelis\add* \add to take possession of\add*.
\v 50 Then you’ll die on that mountain that you are going up on, and you’ll \add join your ancestors\add* (just like your brother Aharon died on Mt. Hor and \add joined his ancestors\add*).
\v 51 \add That’s\add* because you were unfaithful to me among the \add Israelis\add* at the Meribah springs in Kadesh, in the wilderness of Tsin, because you didn’t regard me as holy \add in front of\add* the \add Israelis\add*.
\v 52 \add So\add* you’ll see the land \add in front of\add* you, but you won’t enter that land that I’m giving to the \add Israelis\add*.
\c 33
\s1 Mosheh’s final blessing for Yisrael
\p
\v 1 This is the blessing with which the man of God, Mosheh \add (Moses)\add*, blessed \add Israelis\add* \add just\add* \add before\add* his death:
\q1
\v 2 “Yahweh came from \add Mt.\add* Sinai came
\q1 and appeared to them from \add Mt.\add* Seir—
\q1 shining out from Mt. Paran.
\q1 He came with ten thousands of holy ones,
\q1 \add holding\add* lightning for them in his right hand.
\q1
\v 3 Yes, he loves the peoples.
\q1 All his holy ones are in your hand.
\q1 They sat down at your feet.
\q1 They \add listen to\add* your instructions:
\q1
\v 4 Mosheh \add gave\add* us those instructions
\q1 \add that would become\add* a \add valuable\add* possession for Yakov’s \add descendants\add*.
\q1
\v 5 \add Yahweh\add* became king over Yeshurun,\f + \fr 33:5 \ft Yeshurun means ‘the upright one’, a term of endearment for Yisrael, also in verse 26.\f*
\q1 when the leaders of the people had gathered—
\q1 Yisrael’s tribes all together.
\b
\p
\v 6 Let Reuven live and not die,
\q1 \add but\add* let his men be few.”
\b
\p
\v 7 Then he said this is for Yehudah \add (Judah)\add*,
\q1 “Yahweh, listen to Yehudah’s voice,
\q1 and take him to his people.
\q1 \add He defended\add* himself,
\q1 plus you help him against his enemies.”
\b
\p
\v 8 Then for Levi, he said,
\q1 “Your Thummim and your Urim
\q1 \add belong to\add* your godly man,
\q1 who you tested at Massah.
\q1 You strove against him at the Merivah \add springs\add*.\x + \xo 33:8: a \xt Exo 28:30; \xo b \xt Exo 17:7; \xo c \xt Exo 17:7; Num 20:13.\x*
\q1
\v 9 He said that he hadn’t seen his father and his mother,
\q1 and he didn’t acknowledge his brothers or \add spend time with\add* his sons.
\q1 because he guarded your message
\q1 and kept your agreement.
\q1
\v 10 He teaches your rules to Yakov,
\q1 and your instructions to Yisrael.
\q1 He’ll \add burn fragrant incense for you\add*,
\q1 and whole burnt offerings on your altar.
\q1
\v 11 Yahweh, bless \add Yisrael’s\add* \add possessions\add*,
\q1 and accept the work \add that he does\add*.
\q1 \add Crush\add* those who \add take action\add* up against him,
\q1 and \add those who hate\add*, in case they \add attack\add*.”
\b
\p
\v 12 To Benyamin, he said,
\q1 “Yahweh’s \add special one\add* lives in security beside him.
\q1 He \add protects\add* him all day \add long\add*,
\q1 and Yahweh \add places him on his chest\add*.”
\b
\p
\v 13 To Yosef \add (Joseph)\add*, he said,
\q1 “Yahweh \add will bless\add* his land,
\q1 with the \add rain from the sky\add*,
\q1 from the dew and from the \add springs\add* lying beneath,
\q1
\v 14 \add with a plentiful harvest from the good sunshine\add*,
\q1 and from the bounty of the produce of the \add seasons\add*,
\q1
\v 15 and \add water\add* from the tops of ancient mountains,
\q1 and from the bounty of age-old hills,
\q2
\v 16 and from the bounty of the soil and from its fullness,
\q1 and the favour of the bush-dweller.
\q1 Let them come on Yosef’s head,
\q1 and on the top of the head of the leader of his brothers.
\q1
\v 17 His majesty is \add like\add* his firstborn bull,
\q1 and his horns are \add like\add* the horns of a wild bull.
\q1 He’ll ram the peoples with them,
\q1 together to the ends of the earth.
\q1 And they are the ten thousands of Efrayim,
\q1 and they are the thousands of Menashsheh.”
\b
\p
\v 18 To Zevulun, he said,
\q1 “Zevulun, be happy when you go out,
\q1 and Yissaskar \add too\add*, in your tents.
\q1
\v 19 They will call peoples to the mountain.
\q1 There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness.
\q1 because they feed on the abundance of the oceans,
\q1 and on treasures hidden in the sand.”
\b
\p
\v 20 To Gad, he said,
\q1 “Blessed be the one who enlarges Gad.
\q1 He’ll live like a lioness,
\q1 and tear off an arm, \add perhaps\add* also a head.
\q1
\v 21 He \add picked out the best\add* for himself,
\q1 because there the decreed portion is reserved.
\q1 He came with the people’s leaders.
\q1 He \add administered\add* Yahweh’s justice,
\q1 and his judgements for Yisrael.”
\b
\p
\v 22 To Dan, he said,
\q1 “Dan is a lion cub
\q1 leaping out from Bashan.”
\b
\p
\v 23 To Naftali, he said,
\q1 “Naftali, overflowing with favour,
\q1 and full of Yahweh’s blessings,
\q1 you’ll possess the west and the south.”
\b
\p
\v 24 To Asher, he said,
\q1 “Asher is blessed among the sons.
\q1 Let him be favored among his brothers,
\q1 and \add enjoy having\add* \add lots of olive\add* oil.
\q1
\v 25 Your gates will have iron and bronze bars,
\q1 and you’ll be strong all your life.
\q1
\v 26 There’s no one \add else\add* like Yeshurun’s God,
\q1 riding the heavens to your help,
\q1 and in his majesty on the clouds.
\q1
\v 27 The \add everlasting God is a place of safety\add*,
\q1 and it’s \add his\add* eternal arms that are underneath \add you\add*.
\q1 He \add drove the enemy away from in front of you\add*,
\q1 and he said, ‘Destroy \add them\add*.’
\q1
\v 28 Israel will live in safety—
\q1 secure as Yakov’s fountain,
\q1 in a land of grain and new wine
\q1 where \add the skies above them\add* drop dew.
\q1
\v 29 Your happiness, Yisrael.
\q1 Who \add else\add* is like you—a people saved by Yahweh,
\q1 the shield \add that protects you\add*,
\q1 and who is the sword \add that makes you powerful\add*?
\q1 Your enemies will cringe back from you,
\q1 and you’ll trample \add all over their hills\add*.”
\c 34
\s1 Yahweh shows the land to Mosheh
\p
\v 1 Then Moses went from the plains of Moab up to Mt. Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is \add opposite\add* Yeriho \add (Jericho)\add*, and Yahweh showed him all the Gilead \add region\add* as far as Dan,
\v 2 all Naftali, the land of Efrayim and Menashsheh, all the land of Yehudah \add (Judah)\add*, to the \add Mediterranean\add* sea,
\v 3 the Negev, and the plain of the Valley of Yeriho (the City of Palms) as far as Tsoar.
\v 4 Then Yahweh told him, “That’s the land that I promised to Abraham, to Yitshak \add (Isaac)\add*, and to Yakov \add (Jacob)\add*, saying, ‘I’ll give it to your descendants.’ I’ve showed it to you \add for you to look at\add*, but you won’t go over there \add into it\add*.”\x + \xo 34:4: a \xt Gen 12:7; \xo b \xt Gen 26:3; \xo c \xt Gen 28:13.\x*
\s1 Mosheh’s death
\p
\v 5 \add So\add* Yahweh’s servant Mosheh \add (Moses)\add* died \add there\add* in Moav \add just as Yahweh had said would happen\add*
\v 6 and he buried him there in the valley opposite Beyt-Peor, \add but\add* to this day, no one knows where his grave is.
\v 7 Mosheh was one hundred and twenty when he died, \add but\add* he still \add had excellent eyesight and strength in his body\add*.
\v 8 The \add Israelis\add* mourned thirty days for him \add there\add* in the Moav plain.
\p
\v 9 \add Meanwhile\add*, Nun’s son Yehoshua \add (Joshua)\add* was full of the spirit of wisdom, because Mosheh had placed his hands on him \add and prayed over him\add*, \add so the Israelis\add* listened to him and did what Yahweh had commanded Mosheh.
\p
\v 10 No prophet like Mosheh who Yahweh knew face to face, has ever emerged in Yisrael since then,\x + \xo 34:10: \xt Exo 33:11.\x*
\v 11 \add or performed\add* all the miracles and amazing things that Yahweh sent him to do in Egypt, to Far-oh \add (Pharaoh)\add*, and to all his servants, and to all his land.
\v 12 \add No other prophet\add* \add has been able to do all the incredible but terrifying things\add* that Mosheh did \add while all Yisrael watched\add*.
