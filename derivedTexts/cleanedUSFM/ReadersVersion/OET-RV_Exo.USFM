\is1 Introduction
\ip The word \bk Exodus\bk* comes from the Greek word meaning ‘departure’ or ‘leaving’. Hebrew readers call this document ‘Shemōt’ which is the second word in the Hebrew and means ‘Names’ because it begins with a list of names. Some European and other translations call it ‘The second book of Mosheh/Moses’.
\ip It should be noted that ‘Mosheh’ is the best English transliteration of the name of the hero of this account. Sadly, he’s commonly known in the English world as ‘Moses’, even though we have all the sounds in our language to be able to pronounce his name more accurately. Unfortunately, because the language of ‘the New Testament’ didn’t have the ‘sh’ sound and had no letter for ‘h’, his Hebrew version of his Egyptian name is corrupted as it goes through Greek ‘Mōsaʸs’ and then Latin ‘Moyses’ and then first entered English in the 1300’s as ‘Moises’. Now that we live in a modern era where we try to show more respect to the names of peoples from other cultures, the \em OET\em* encourages the same for Biblical characters (especially the major ones), hence ‘Mosheh’. (Maybe a little bit of relearning could demonstrate a lot of respect to the Jewish people whose ancestors are chronicled in these accounts.)
\ip After God had used a famine to cause his people to go down into Egypt (Mitsrayim), this document records how they eventually become slaves, but then God works many miracles to enable them to leave again, and not only that, to be paid at the end for their work.
\ip This story can be divided into three main parts: 1. their slavery in Egypt, and how God called Mosheh (Moses), the child who had been adopted by an Egyptian princess, to lead them out of slavery; 2. how God assisted them when they were chased by the Egyptian army, then when they reached Mt. Sinai, how they were miraculously given food and drink there at the mountain; 3. how Yahweh revealed himself to Mosheh there at Mt. Sinai, and gave him instructions to guide their lives and their nation, and God’s agreement with the people; 4. the ending is the construction of the sacred tent, complete with instructions about how they should worship.
\ip An overview would be how God rescued his people from slavery and established them as a nation that was hopeful of a good future.
\ip \em Mosheh\em* is the most important person in this account. He was chosen by God to lead his people out of slavery and right out of Egypt. The \em ten commands\em* are another well-known component of this document and can be found in chapter twenty.

\s1 Yisra’el’s descendants are driven into slavery
\p
\v 1 These are the names of Yisra’el’s descendants who accompanied Yacob (Jacob) when he moved his household to Egypt:\x + \xo 1:1-4: \xt Gen 46:8-27.\x*
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Yehudah,
\v 3 Yissashkar (Issachar), Zebulun, Benyamin,
\v 4 Dan, Naftali, Gad, and Asher.
\v 5 \add At that time,\add* Yacob had a total of seventy descendants (including Yosef \add and his sons\add* who were \add already\add* in Egypt.)
\p
\v 6 \add As the years progressed,\add* Yosef and his brothers died—all of that generation,
\v 7 \add but they’d had many children who went on to have their own children and grandchildren,\add* and so they became a large and powerful group \add there in Egypt\add*.\x + \xo 1:7: \xt Acts 7:17.\x*
\p
\v 8 \add Eventually\add* a new king came to power in Egypt \add (Mitsrayim)\add* who had never known Yosef\x + \xo 1:8: \xt Acts 7:18.\x*
\v 9 and he told his people, “Listen, those descendants of Yisrael \add (Israel)\add* are becoming more numerous and powerful than us.
\v 10 \add So\add*, let’s deal wisely with them, in case they \add continue to\add* multiply. Then if war was to break out, they could easily take the other side and fight against us, and then leave our country.”\x + \xo 1:10: \xt Acts 7:19.\x*
\v 11 Then they appointed overseers to work them in slave gangs, and using them as forced labour, they built the store cities at Pithon and Rameses for Far’oh (Pharaoh).
\v 12 \add However,\add* the more they oppressed them, the more they multiplied and spread out, and \add the more\add* the Egyptians came to dread the Israelis.
\v 13 \add So they\add* made the Israelis work \add long, hard hours\add*,
\v 14 and they made their lives bitter with the hard slavery. \add They were forced to make\add* mortar and bricks, as well as all kinds of slave labour in the fields—all the work they had to do was \add strenuous and tiring\add*.
\p
\v 15 Then the king of Egypt spoke to Shiphrah and Puah, the two Hebrew midwives,
\v 16 saying, “When you assist the Hebrew women as midwives, \add as you sit there on your\add* stool, if you see that it’s a male, do \add something\add* so he’ll die, but if it’s a female, then let her live.”
\v 17 But the midwives \add were godly women\add* and didn’t do according to what the Egyptian king \add had instructed\add* them, and they let the boys live.
\v 18 \add So\add* the king called the midwives \add back\add*, and he \add demanded\add*, “Why have you done that and let \add their\add* sons live?”
\p
\v 19 “Because the Hebrew women aren’t like Egyptian women,” the midwives \add answered\add*. “They’re \add more active\add* and give birth before the midwife \add even\add* gets to them.”
\v 20 \add So\add* God rewarded the midwives, and \add meanwhile,\add* the people \add continued to increase in number\add* and become more powerful,
\v 21 and because the midwives had \add demonstrated their desire to obey\add* God, he gave them families \add of their own\add*.
\v 22 Then Far’oh commanded all of his people, “You \add all need to\add* toss every newborn boy into the river, but you can let the girls live.”\x + \xo 1:22: \xt Acts 7:19.\x*
\c 2
\s1 The birth of Mosheh (Moses)
\p
\v 1 \add During this period,\add* a man from the tribe of Levi married a woman who was also a Levite,
\v 2 and she conceived and gave birth to a son. When she saw that he was a \add healthy\add* boy, she hid him away for three months,\x + \xo 2:2: \xt Acts 7:20; Heb 11:23.\x*
\v 3 \add but\add* then she wasn’t able to hide him any longer. \add So\add* she got a basket made from \add woven\add* reeds and plastered it with bitumen and pitch. Then she put the baby in it, and floated \add the basket\add* in the reeds along the riverbank,
\v 4 \add leaving the baby’s\add* sister to watch from a distance to see what would happen to him.
\p
\v 5 \add After a while,\add* Far’oh’s daughter came down to the river to wash \add herself\add*, and \add she and\add* her young \add attendants\add* were walking along the \add riverbank\add*. She saw the container among the reeds and sent \add one of\add* her slave women to get it.
\v 6 She opened it and saw the baby inside, and wow, he \add started\add* crying. She felt sorry for him and said, “This baby \add must be\add* one of the Hebrew children.”
\p
\v 7 Then his sister \add approached and\add* asked \add the princess\add*, “Would you like me to go and find a Hebrew woman who’ll be able to breastfeed the baby for you?”
\p
\v 8 “\add Yes,\add* go,” answered Far’oh’s daughter, and the girl went and got the baby’s mother.
\v 9 “Take this baby,” said the \add princess\add*, “and breastfeed him for me, and I’ll pay you \add for doing it\add*.” \add So\add* the woman took the baby and \add looked after\add* him.
\v 10 \add When\add* the boy had grown \add enough\add*, she brought him \add back\add* to Far’oh’s daughter and he became her son. She named him ‘Mosheh’\f + \fr 2:10 \ft More familiar to most English readers as ‘Moses’ from the Greek ‘Μωσῆς’ (Mōsaʸs) but Greek doesn’t have an ‘h’ or a ‘sh’ so by going through Greek we ended up with something quite different from his real name. However, English does have those sounds and letters, so there’s no reason why we can’t get this name correct.\f* \add (which means ‘pulled out’)\add* because she said that she’d \add plucked\add* him out of the \add river\add*.\x + \xo 2:10: \xt Acts 7:21.\x*
\s1 Mosheh escapes to Midiyan
\p
\v 11 \add Later on\add* when Mosheh was fully grown, he went out to visit \add the Hebrews\add* and saw their \add forced labour\add*, and he saw an Egyptian man beating a Hebrew man—one of his own people.\x + \xo 2:11-14: \xt Acts 7:23-28.\x*
\v 12 \add Mosheh\add* looked around to check that no one was watching, then he hit the Egyptian, \add killing him,\add* then he hid his body in the sand.
\v 13 The next day, he went out again and wow, two Hebrew men were fighting each other, and he said to the man in the wrong, “Why are you hitting your \add fellow Hebrew\add*?”
\p
\v 14 “Who made you the ruler and judge over us?” \add the man replied\add*. “Are you \add planning\add* to kill me like you killed \add that\add* Egyptian?” Then Mosheh was afraid because he realised that what he’d done had \add probably become widely\add* known.
\v 15 \add Indeed,\add* when Far’oh heard about it, he \add ordered\add* Mosheh to be killed. \add So\add* Mosheh had to flee from \add the king\add* and he \add took off east\add* to live in Midian and he stayed near the well.\x + \xo 2:15: \xt Acts 7:29; Heb 11:27.\x*
\p
\v 16 The priest there in Midian had seven daughters, and they would come to the well to draw water out and fill up the troughs there so their father’s \add sheep and goats\add* could drink.
\v 17 Now some male shepherds came along and \add started to\add* shoo their flock away, but Mosheh got involved and helped them so that their animals could drink.
\v 18 \add When\add* they \add got home\add* to their father Reuel, he \add asked\add*, “How come you \add got home\add* so early today?”
\p
\v 19 “There was an Egyptian man,” they \add answered\add*, “who stood up for us against those \add other\add* shepherds. And he even drew \add water\add* for us and gave our flock water to drink.”
\p
\v 20 “Where is he \add now\add*?” he \add asked them\add*. “What’s this—you mean you all just left him there? Go and get him \add so we can give him a meal\add*.”
\p
\v 21 \add Later it turned out that\add* Mosheh was prepared to live with the man, and \add in due course\add* he gave his daughter Zipporah to Mosheh \add in marriage\add*.
\v 22 \add When\add* she gave birth to a son, he named him ‘Gershom’ \add (which means ‘foreigner’)\add* because he said, “I’ve become a foreigner \add living\add* in a foreign land.”
\p
\v 23 \add Eventually\add* Egypt’s king died, \add but\add* the Israelis groaned from the slavery \add they were still under\add* and they cried out, and their cry \add for freedom\add* from slavery went up to God.
\v 24 \add He\add* heard their groaning and remembered his agreement with Abraham, with Yitshak, and with Yacob,\x + \xo 2:24: \xt Gen 15:13-14.\x*
\v 25 and he \add looked down on\add* the Israelis and he \add was concerned about them\add*.

\s1 God calls Mosheh from a burning bush
\p
\v 1 \add One time\add* Mosheh (Moses) was shepherding the flock of his father-in-law Yetro (or Jethro, the priest at Midian), and he led the flock beyond the wilderness and came to a hill. (\add This was later known as\add* the mountain of God at Horev).
\v 2 \add While he was there.\add* Yahweh’s messenger appeared to him in a flame coming from the middle of a bush, and as \add Mosheh\add* looked, to his surprise \add he saw that\add* the bush was burning in the fire yet not \add actually\add* being burnt up.\x + \xo 3:2-10: \xt Acts 7:30-34.\x*
\v 3 “I’ve got to go and see this amazing sight,” Mosheh said \add to himself\add*. “How come that bush isn’t burning up?”
\p
\v 4 When Yahweh saw that he’d left his path in order to look, God called to him from the middle of the bush, “Mosheh, Mosheh.”
\p “I’m here,” he \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 5 “Don’t come any closer,” \add Yahweh\add* said. “Take off your sandals because the place where you’re standing is HOLY ground.
\v 6 I’m the god of your father and the god of Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob.” \add So\add* Mosheh covered hid his face because he was scared to look at God.
\p
\v 7 “I’ve certainly noticed the suffering of my people in Egypt,” Yahweh \add continued\add*, “I’ve heard their cries as the \add slave drivers\add* oppress them—I’m unmistakingly aware of their pain.
\v 8 \add So\add* I’ve come down to set them free from Egyptian control and to bring them up from \add there\add* to a good and wide land—a land flowing with milk and honey. \add It’s currently\add* the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Yebusites.
\v 9 \add Yes,\add* the cry of the Israelis has now \add reached\add* me and what’s more, I’ve seen \add how much\add* the Egyptians are oppressing them.
\v 10 \add So\add* go now and I’ll send you to Far’oh (Pharaoh) and bring my people—Yisra’el’s descendants—out from Egypt.”
\p
\v 11 “Who am I, that I should go to Far’oh,” Mosheh \add asked\add* God, “and that I should \add be the one to\add* bring out the Israelis out from Egypt?”
\p
\v 12 “I’ll certainly be with you,” \add God replied,\add* “and this will be your sign \add so that you’ll know\add* that I have sent you: when you bring the people out from Egypt, you all will serve God on this \add very\add* hill.”
\p
\v 13 “\add But listen\add*,” Mosheh told God, “\add If\add* I’m about to go to the Israelis and if I told them, ‘The God of your ancestors has sent me to you.’ then they’d \add ask\add* me, ‘\add Oh yeah,\add* what’s his name?’ then what would I tell them?”\x + \xo 3:13: \xt Exo 6:2-3.\x*
\p
\v 14 “I AM WHO I AM,” God told Mosheh. “You’ll \add tell them this\add*: ‘I AM (Yahweh) sent me to you.’ ”\x + \xo 3:14: \xt Rev 1:4,8.\x*
\v 15 Then he \add continued\add*, “This is what you \add need\add* to tell the Israelis: ‘Yahweh, the god of your ancestors, the god of Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob, sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial from generation to generation.’
\v 16 Go and gather the Israeli elders, and tell them, ‘Yahweh, the god of your ancestors, appeared to me, the god of Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob, to say, “I’ve certainly noticed you all and \add how you’re all being treated\add* in Egypt,
\v 17 and I’ve promised to take you all from your mistreatment in Egypt, away to the land where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and the Yebusites \add are currently living\add*—to a land flowing with milk and honey.” ’
\p
\v 18 Then \add the people\add* will listen to what you tell them, and you and the Israeli elders will go to the Egyptian king and you’ll all tell him, ‘Yahweh, the god of the Hebrews, has met with us. \add So\add* now, please let us go three days’ journey into the wilderness, so we can sacrifice to Yahweh, our god.’
\v 19 \add But\add* I know that the Egyptian king won’t let you go \add until he’s forced to\add*.
\v 20 \add So I will use force\add* and I’ll strike Egypt with \add several supernatural acts\add*, and after those, he’ll let you all go.
\p
\v 21 Then I’ll \add make\add* the Egyptian \add people favour you all in such a way that \add* when you go, you \add won’t leave empty-handed\add*.\x + \xo 3:21-22: \xt Exo 12:35-36.\x*
\v 22 \add For example,\add* an \add Israeli\add* woman will ask her \add Egyptian\add* neighbour (or from someone staying \add where she lives\add*) for gold and silver items and for clothing. Then you’ll put them on your sons and daughters, and \add in this way\add* you’ll all plunder the Egyptians.”

\s1 God gives Mosheh three miracles
\p
\v 1 “But listen,” Mosheh responded, “they won’t believe me and won’t listen to \add what I say\add*, because they’ll say, ‘Yahweh never showed himself to you.’ ”
\v 2 “\add Well,\add* what’s that in your hand?” Yahweh \add asked\add*.
\p “\add My shepherd’s\add* staff,” he said.
\v 3 “Throw it on the ground,” \add Yahweh\add* said. \add So Mosheh\add* he threw it onto the ground and it became a snake, and \add he quickly moved back away from it\add*.
\v 4 “Pick it up by its tail.” Yahweh told him. \add So Mosheh\add* picked it up by the tail and it became a staff in his hand \add again\add*.
\v 5 “That’s so that they’ll believe that \add I\add* appeared to you: Yahweh—the god of their ancestors—the god of Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob.”
\p
\v 6 “\add Now\add* put your hand \add on your chest—\add*inside your robe.” Yahweh added. \add So Mosheh did that\add*, and when he pulled it out again, his hand had gone \add totally\add* white with disease.
\v 7 Then Yahweh said, “\add Now, put\add* your hand \add back in again\add*.” \add So Mosheh did it again,\add* and when he pulled it out, wow, it had \add returned to normal\add*.
\v 8 “\add So,\add* if they don’t believe you, and \add if the first miracle doesn’t convince them\add*, then they’ll believe \add that second miracle\add*.
\v 9 And then, even if they don’t believe those two miracles and \add won’t believe what you tell them\add*, then you should take some water from the river and pour it onto the dry land. Then the water which came from the river will \add turn into\add* blood \add there\add* on the dry land.”
\p
\v 10 “Oh my master,” Mosheh \add responded\add*, “I’m not \add very good at speaking to others—I never have been and still aren’t. I seem to get tongue-tied easily\add*.”
\p
\v 11 “Who \add was it that made people’s mouths\add*?” Yahweh said. “Who makes \add someone\add* mute or deaf, or seeing or blind? Isn’t it me, Yahweh?
\v 12 \add So\add* get going now, and I’ll \add look after\add* your mouth and \add show\add* you what you to say.”
\p
\v 13 \add But Mosheh replied\add*, “Oh master, please send \add someone else\add*.”
\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh got angry with Mosheh and told him, “Isn’t Aharon (Aaron) a fellow Levite and your brother? I know that he can speak well, and \add what’s\add* more, he’ll come \add from Egypt\add* to meet you, and \add when he does, he’ll be very happy\add*.
\v 15 \add He’ll become your speaker\add* and you’ll be able to talk to him and \add tell him what to say\add*. I’ll be \add helping both of you speak\add* and I’ll teach you both what you should do.
\v 16 \add So in that way,\add* he’ll be like a mouth for you and speak to the people for you, and you’ll be like God to him.
\v 17 \add In addition,\add* you’ll have that staff with you in order to do those miracles.”
\s1 Mosheh returns to Egypt
\p
\v 18 Then Mosheh went back to his father-in-law Yetro (Jethro), and told him, “Can I please leave so I can return to my \add relatives\add* in Egypt and see whether they’re still alive.”
\p “Go in peace,” Yetro \add answered\add*.
\p
\v 19 \add Meanwhile\add* Yahweh had told Mosheh in Midian, “Leave here and return to Egypt because all those who \add wanted to kill you\add* are \add now\add* dead.”
\v 20 Then Mosheh took his wife and sons and put them on a donkey and returned towards Egypt \add with them\add*, and Mosheh took the staff \add that God had turned into a snake\add*.
\p
\v 21 \add On the way,\add* Yahweh said to Mosheh, “When you return to Egypt, all those miracles that I gave you, you’ll be able to \add demonstrate\add* them in front of Far’oh (Pharaoh), but as for me, I’m going to \add make him stubborn so that\add* he won’t let \add your\add* people leave.
\v 22 \add But\add* tell Far’oh, ‘Yahweh has stated that Yisra’el is \add like\add* his oldest son
\v 23 and he asked you to let that son go so that he can serve him. But you refused to let \add Yisra’el\add* go, so \add Yahweh\add* will kill \em your\em* oldest son.’ ”\x + \xo 4:23: \xt Exo 12:29.\x*
\p
\v 24 \add One night\add* as they were \add overnighting at\add* a lodging place near the road, Yahweh \add confronted Mosheh\add* and would have killed him,
\v 25 \add but his wife\add* Zipporah took a flint \add knife\add* and cut off her son’s foreskin and \add threw\add* it at \add Mosheh’s\add* feet saying, “You’re definitely a bloody \add husband\add* to me.”
\v 26 (That was referring to circumcision.) \add So\add* then \add Yahweh left them alone\add*.
\p
\v 27 \add Meanwhile\add* Yahweh had told Aharon, “Go \add out\add* into the wilderness to meet Mosheh.” \add So\add* he went and met him at the hill of God, and he kissed him.
\v 28 Then Mosheh told Aharon \add everything\add* that Yahweh had told him and how he had sent him, and all the miracles that he commanded him \add to demonstrate\add*.
\p
\v 29 Then Mosheh and Aharon went \add to Egypt\add* and they assembled all the \add Israeli\add* elders
\v 30 and Aharon told them \add everything\add* that Yahweh had spoken to Mosheh. Then \add Mosheh\add* did the miracles in front of \add them\add*,
\v 31 and the people believed. Then they heard how Yahweh had paid attention to the Israelis and that he had seen their suffering, and they bowed and prostrated themselves \add in thankfulness\add*.
\c 5
\s1 Mosheh challenges the Egyptian king
\p
\v 1 After that, Mosheh and Aharon went in and said to Far’oh, “This is what Yisrael’s God Yahweh says: ‘Let my people go, \add so\add* they can celebrate me \add out\add* in the wilderness.’ ”
\p
\v 2 \add But the king\add* said, “Who’s \add this\add* ‘Yahweh’ that I should listen to \add him telling me\add* to let Yisrael go? I don’t know Yahweh, and what’s more, I won’t let \add the Israelis\add* go \add anywhere\add*.”
\p
\v 3 “The God of \add us\add* Hebrews has met with us,” they \add replied\add*, “Please, let us go three days into the wilderness so we can sacrifice to our God Yahweh, \add because we don’t want him to strike\add* us with the plague or with \add war\add*.”
\p
\v 4 “Mosheh and Aharon,” the king of Egypt answered, “why are you causing the people to \add slacken\add* off from their tasks? \add Get back\add* to your \add work\add*.”
\v 5 And Far’oh \add continued\add*, “Listen, there’s many \add of you\add* and you \add two\add* have caused them to rest from their \add duties\add*.”
\p
\v 6 Then on that \add very same\add* day, Far’oh ordered the people’s slave masters and supervisors,
\v 7 “Don’t give straw to the people to make bricks with as \add you’ve done up till now\add*. They can go and gather straw for themselves.
\v 8 But \add keep\add* the \add same\add* quota of bricks \add as before\add*—don’t decrease it because they \add must be\add* idle \add if they have time to say\add*, ‘Let us go—let us sacrifice to our god.’
\v 9 \add Give the men more work so they’ll be too busy to worry about deceptive words\add*.”
\p
\v 10 \add So\add* the slave masters and supervisors of the people went out and told \add them all\add*, “\add The king\add* has said that he won’t give you any more straw,
\v 11 \add so\add* you’ll \add all have to\add* go and get your own straw from wherever you can find it, because there’ll be no reduction to your \add quota\add*.”
\v 12 So the people dispersed throughout all of Egypt to gather stubble for straw,
\v 13 and the taskmasters were \add hassling\add* them, saying, “\add Hurry up and\add* finish your day’s work, the same as when \add you were given\add* straw.”
\v 14 Then the Israeli foremen that Far’oh’s slave masters had appointed were beaten and told, “Why haven’t you met your required brick making \add quota\add* yesterday or today? \add It’s just the same as in the past\add*.”
\p
\v 15 \add So\add* the Israeli foremen went and complained to Far’oh, “Why are you treating your servants like this?
\v 16 We haven’t been given any straw and yet they’re telling us to keep making bricks. And see, we your servants get beaten, but it’s your people’s mistake.”
\p
\v 17 “You’re all lazy—plain lazy!” \add the king responded\add*. “That’s why you’re saying, ‘Let us go sacrifice to Yahweh.’
\v 18 \add So\add* go now! \add Back to\add* work! And you won’t be given straw, but you \add still have to meet the quota\add* of bricks.”
\p
\v 19 \add When\add* the Israeli foremen heard that the quota wasn’t going to be reduced, they \add realised how serious their problem was\add*,
\v 20 \add so\add* when they left Far’oh they \add confronted\add* Mosheh and Aharon who were waiting to meet them,
\v 21 “May Yahweh \add see what you’ve done and judge you for it\add* because you’ve \add raised a big stink in Far’oh’s mind\add* and with his servants. \add Now they have their excuse\add* to kill us!”
\s1 Mosheh complains to God
\p
\v 22 Then Mosheh went back to Yahweh and \add asked\add*, “My master, why have you \add taken it out on our\add* people? Was this why you sent me?
\v 23 \add Ever\add* since I went to Far’oh to \add deliver your message\add*, he’s \add made\add* these people \add suffer\add* and you \add clearly\add* haven’t rescued \add them\add*.”
\c 6
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Mosheh, “Now you’ll see what I’ll do to Far’oh. \add I’ll use my power to force him to\add* let them go, and then \add using my power again\add* he’ll \add actually\add* drive them out of his \add country\add*.”
\s1 God promises to rescue the people
\p
\v 2 Then God spoke to Mosheh \add again\add*, “I am Yahweh\x + \xo 6:2-3: \xt Gen 17:1; 28:3; 35:11; Exo 3:13-15.\x*
\v 3 and I \add revealed myself\add* to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Yacob as El Shaddai (God the provider) but they didn’t know me by my name Yahweh.
\v 4 \add What’s more,\add* I made an agreement with them: to give them the Canaan region—the area which they had been staying in.
\v 5 \add Furthermore,\add* I’ve heard the complaints from the Israelis who have been enslaved by the Egyptians, and I have remembered my agreement.
\v 6 Therefore, tell the Israelis, ‘I am Yahweh and I will \add help you escape from\add* the \add control\add* of the Egyptians and rescue you from their slavery. I’ll buy you out of slavery using my power and by \add punishing the Egyptians for this injustice\add*.
\v 7 I’ll take you all to be my own people, and I’ll be your god. Then you’ll know that I am Yahweh your god—the one rescuing you all from the Egyptian oppression.
\v 8 Then I’ll \add take\add* you all to the land that I \add promised\add* to give to Abraham, to Yitshak, and to Yacob, and I’ll give it to you as \add your own\add*. I am Yahweh.’ ”
\v 9 \add So\add* Mosheh \add passed all that on\add* to the Israelis, but they wouldn’t listen to Mosheh, because they were \add both discouraged and worn out from the slavery\add*.
\p
\v 10 Then Yahweh told Mosheh,
\v 11 “Go and speak to the Egyptian king Far’oh and \add tell him\add* that he needs to let the Israelis leave his country.”
\v 12 And Mosheh said in front of Yahweh, “Look, the Israelis haven’t listened to me, so why would Far’oh listen? And I have \add difficulty speaking\add*.”
\v 13 Then Yahweh spoke to Mosheh and Aharon, and he gave them a command to \add pass on to\add* the Israelis and to the Egyptian king Far’oh: to \add take\add* the Israelis out of Egypt.
\s1 The ancestors of Mosheh and Aharon
\p
\v 14 The following were the leaders of the clans:
\p The sons of \bd Reuben\bd* (Yisra’el’s eldest son) were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Karmi, and \add they headed\add* the clans of Reuben.
\p
\v 15 \bd Simeon\bd*’s sons were Yemuel, Yamin, Ohad, Yakin, Zohar, and Shaul—the son of a Canaanite woman, and \add they headed\add* the clans of Simeon.
\p
\v 16 \bd Levi\bd*’s sons were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi was 137 years old when he died.\x + \xo 6:16-19: \xt Num 3:17-20; 26:57-58; 1Ch 6:16-19.\x*
\v 17 Gershon’s sons were Libni and Shimei, and \add they headed\add* their clans.
\v 18 Kohath’s sons were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. Kohath was 133 years old when he died.
\v 19 Merari’s sons were Mahli and Mushi, and \add all of those headed\add* the clans of Levi.
\v 20 Amram married his aunt Yochebed, and she gave birth to Aharon and Mosheh. Amram lived to be 137 years old.
\v 21 Izhar’s sons were Korah, Nefeg, and Zichri.
\v 22 Uzziel’s sons were Mishael, Elzafan, and Sithri.
\p
\v 23 Aharon \add married\add* Elisheba, Amminadab’s daughter and the sister of Nahshon, and she gave birth to Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
\v 24 Korah’s sons were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph, and \add they headed\add* the clans of Korah.
\v 25 Aharon’s son Eleazar took a wife for himself from the daughters of Putiel and she gave birth to Finehas.
\p \add All of\add* those \add headed\add* the clans of Levi.
\p
\v 26 It was to Aharon and Mosheh that Yahweh had said, “Bring the Israelis out of Egypt by their \add tribes\add*.”
\v 27 They were the ones who spoke to the Egyptian king Far’oh, to bring the Israelis out of Egypt.
\s1 God’s reassurances to Mosheh and Aharon
\p
\v 28 On the day that Yahweh spoke to Mosheh in Egypt,
\v 29 he said, “I am Yahweh. Tell the Egyptian king Far’oh everything that I tell you.”
\p
\v 30 “Please listen to me,” Mosheh \add responded\add*. “I’m \add not a good speaker\add*, so why should Far’oh listen to me?”
\c 7
\p
\v 1 Yahweh \add answered\add*, “Listen, I’ve made you \add like\add* God to Far’oh, and your brother Aharon will be your prophet.
\v 2 You’ll \add quietly\add* say everything that I tell you to and then your brother Aharon will \add relay it\add* to Far’oh \add and tell him\add* that he must let the Israelis leave his country.
\v 3 \add But\add* I’ll \add make\add* Far’oh \add stubborn\add* and \add so\add* I’ll increase the signs and miracles \add that I’ll do\add* in Egypt.\x + \xo 7:3: \xt Acts 7:36.\x*
\v 4 Far’oh won’t listen to you so I’ll \add pressure\add* Egypt, and I’ll use severe judgements \add to ensure that I\add* bring my armies—my people the Israelis—out Egypt.
\v 5 The Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I \add demonstrate my power to\add* Egypt \add by taking\add* the Israelis out from the middle of them.”
\v 6 \add So\add* Mosheh and Aharon did everything that Yahweh told them to do.
\v 7 (Mosheh was eighty and Aharon was eighty-three when they were \add interacting with\add* Far’oh.)
\s1 Staffs and snakes
\p
\v 8 Then Yahweh told Mosheh and Aharon,
\v 9 “\add When\add* Far’oh tells you to perform a miracle \add as a sign\add*, then \add just\add* tell Aharon to take his\f + \fr 7:9 \ft It’s not clear here in this account, or even in the following events, if Mosheh and Aharon had separate miraculous sticks, or if Mosheh had (temporarily?) entrusted his original staff/rod/stick to his brother and spokesman Aharon.\f*staff and throw it down in front of Far’oh so it turns into a snake.”
\v 10 \add So\add* Mosheh and Aharon went in to Far’oh’s \add court\add* and did what Yahweh had told them: Aharon threw his staff down in front of Far’oh and his servants and it turned into a snake.
\v 11 Then Far’oh also called for \add his\add* wise men and sorcerers, and the Egyptian magicians did \add the same thing\add* using their magic—
\v 12 each \add of them\add* threw down his staff and they became snakes, \add except that\add* Aharon’s staff swallowed up their staffs.
\v 13 \add But\add* Far’oh’s \add mind was made up\add* and he \add took no notice of them\add* as Yahweh had said \add earlier\add*.
\s1 Plague 1: Water to blood
\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh told Mosheh, “Far’oh \add is very stubborn and\add* he’s refused to let the people go.
\v 15 \add So\add* go to Far’oh. Listen, \add every\add* morning he goes \add down\add* to the \add river\add*, so station yourself to meet him on the bank. Take the staff with you that turned into a snake,
\v 16 and tell him, ‘Yahweh, the god of the Hebrews, \add previously\add* sent me to you to say, “Let my people go \add so\add* they can serve me in the wilderness.” But listen, until now you haven’t \add done it\add*
\v 17 so Yahweh says, “\add Now\add* you will know that I am Yahweh because of this: See, I’m about to use my staff to strike the water in the Nile and it will turn to blood\x + \xo 7:17: \xt Rev 16:4.\x*
\v 18 and the fish in the river will die and the river will stink. Then \add your people\add* will \add gag\add* to drink \add the\add* water from the river.” ’
\p
\v 19 “Tell Aharon to take his staff and stretch out his hand over the waters of Egypt: over their streams, their canals, and their pools, and over every reservoir of their water, and \add the water\add* will become blood. Then there’ll be blood in \add the entire country\add*—even in wooden or stone containers \add of water\add*.”
\p
\v 20 \add So\add* And Mosheh and Aharon did \add exactly\add* what Yahweh had commanded: \add Aharon\add* raised the staff and struck the river, while Far’oh and his servants \add watched\add*, and the \add entire\add* river turned to blood.
\v 21 Then the fish in the river died and the river stank, so the Egyptians couldn’t drink water from the river, and the blood was all \add over\add* Egypt.
\v 22 \add But\add* the Egyptian sorcerers did the same with their magic, and \add so\add* Far’oh \add stayed stubborn\add* and wouldn’t listen to them, just as Yahweh had said \add earlier\add*.
\v 23 The Far’oh turned around and went \add back to\add* his house, and he \add put all of that out of his mind\add*.
\v 24 \add Meanwhile,\add* all the Egyptians dug holes around the river to get water to drink, because river water was undrinkable.
\s1 Plague 2: Frogs everywhere
\p
\v 25 \add So\add* a week went by since Yahweh had struck the river
\c 8
\v 1 and \add he\add* said to Mosheh, “Go to Far’oh and tell him, ‘Yahweh says that you \add must\add* let my people go \add so \add* they can serve me.\f + \fr 8:1 \ft This is 7:26 in some versifications (and the following three verses are 7:27, 28, & 29).\f*
\v 2 \add But\add* if you refuse to let \add them\add* go, then look, I’m about to pound your entire territory with frogs.
\v 3 The frogs will swarm in the river, then they’ll climb out and go into your house and in your bedroom and onto your bed. They’ll go into your servants’ houses and among your people, and in your \add cooking\add* bowls and into your ovens.
\v 4 They’ll climb on you and on your people and on all your servants.’ ”
\p
\v 5 Then Yahweh said to Mosheh, “Tell Aharon: Hold your staff out over the canals, the streams, and the pools, and cause the frogs to come up onto the land of Egypt.”
\v 6 \add So\add* Aharon reached out his hand over the Egyptian water \add supplies\add* and frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt.
\v 7 \add But\add* the sorcerers did the same with their magic, and they \add too\add* brought up frogs over the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 8 Then Far’oh called for Mosheh and Aharon, and told \add them\add*, “Ask Yahweh to take the frogs away from me and from my people. Then I’ll let \add your\add* people go, and they can sacrifice to Yahweh.”
\p
\v 9 Mosheh answered, “I’ll pray for you and your servants and your people, \add praying that\add* the frogs will keep away from you and your homes and only be left in the river. \add And I’ll give you the honour of specifying when it’ll happen\add*.”
\p
\v 10 “Tomorrow \add morning\add*,” \add the king replied\add*.
\p “Just as you say,” \add Mosheh responded\add*, “so that you’ll know that there’s no one \add else\add* like our god Yahweh.
\v 11 \add Tomorrow\add* the frogs will leave you and go away from your houses, and from your servants and your people. They’ll only be left in the river.”
\v 12 Then Mosheh and Aharon left Far’oh and Mosheh called out to Yahweh concerning the \add retraction\add* of the frogs that he’d sent against \add the king\add*.
\v 13 \add So\add* Yahweh did what Mosheh had requested and the frogs died off from the houses and the courtyards, and from the fields.
\v 14 \add The people\add* collected them into many piles and the \add whole country\add* stank.
\v 15 \add But when\add* Far’oh saw that there was \add relief from the frogs\add*, he \add firmed his resolve\add* and didn’t listen to \add Mosheh and Aharon\add*, just as Yahweh had said \add previously\add*.
\s1 Plague 3: Lice
\p
\v 16 Then Yahweh said to Mosheh, “Tell Aharon: Stretch out your staff and strike the dust on the ground, and it will turn into lice\f + \fr 8:16 \ft The Hebrew word ‘כֵּן/כִּנִּם’ (kēn/kinnim) could refer to either lice, gnats, or fleas. However, unlike lice, gnats don’t usually \em reside\em* on people and animals (which seems to be implied by the text).\f* all over Egypt.”
\v 17 So Aharon held out his staff and struck the dust \add with it\add*, and \add the dust\add* became lice on the people and on the animals. All over Egypt, the dust turned into lice
\v 18 and the sorcerers tried to do the same with their magic but they were unable to. \add So\add* there were lice on people and animals
\v 19 and the magicians said to Far’oh, “This is God’s finger.” \add But Far’oh was stubborn\add* and he didn’t listen to them, just as Yahweh had said \add previously\add*.\x + \xo 8:19: \xt Luk 11:20.\x*
\s1 Plague 4: The swarm
\p
\v 20 Then Yahweh said to Mosheh, “Get up early in the morning and \add when you see Far’oh\add* coming down to the river, station yourself in front of \add him\add* and tell him, ‘Yahweh saw that you \add must\add* let my people go \add so \add* they can serve me.
\v 21 Certainly if you don’t release my people immediately, then take note: I’m about to send the swarm\f + \fr 8:21 \ft The Hebrew word ‘עָרֹב’ (ˊārov) probably meaning ‘mixture’ is sometimes translated as ‘swarm’. This plague could have been anything from flies to other insects (hornets or mosquitoes???) all the way to a mixture of wild animals.\f* at you and your servants and at your people and into your houses. The Egyptians’ houses will be full of the swarm and even the ground that they’re on.
\v 22 \add But when it happens,\add* I’ll distinguish the Goshen region where my people live so the swarm won’t be there, \add so that you’ll be able to see\add* that I’m Yahweh \add and I’m right here\add* in this land.
\v 23 This sign will happen tomorrow and \add you’ll see how I plan to set my people free\add* from your people.’ ”
\v 24 \add So\add* Yahweh did \add what he’d said\add* and a heavy swarm came to Far’oh’s house and the houses of his servants and all the Egyptians—the country was ruined by the \add arrival\add* of the swarm.
\p
\v 25 Then Far’oh called for Mosheh and to Aharon and told \add them\add*, “Go and sacrifice to the god of you all, \add but here in Egypt\add*.”
\p
\v 26 “It wouldn’t be right to do that,” Mosheh \add replied\add*, “because our sacrifices to Yahweh our god \add would be offensive\add* to Egyptians. Listen, if we made sacrifices in front of the Egyptians \add that are repulsive to them\add*, wouldn’t they \add throw rocks at us to try to kill us\add*?
\v 27 We need to travel into the wilderness for three days, then we’ll sacrifice to our god Yahweh \add there\add*, just like he’s telling us to.”
\p
\v 28 \add So\add* Far’oh \add relented\add*, “I’ll let you all go into the wilderness and sacrifice to Yahweh your god—except you definitely can’t go very far. \add Now,\add* ask God for me \add for the plague to stop\add*.”
\p
\v 29 “Listen, I’m about to \add leave now\add*,” Mosheh \add responded\add*, “and I’ll pray to Yahweh and he’ll withdraw the swarm from Far’oh tomorrow, and from his servants and his people. \add But\add* may Far’oh not be dishonest \add again and\add* fail to let our people go to sacrifice to Yahweh.”
\p
\v 30 Then Mosheh left Far’oh and prayed to Yahweh
\v 31 and Yahweh did \add what\add* Mosheh \add asked him\add* and he withdrew the swarm from Far’oh, and from his servants and his people. Not one remained.
\v 32 \add But\add* Far’oh \add changed his mind and remained stubborn and he wouldn’t let the Israelis leave\add*.
\c 9
\s1 Plague 5: The stock disease
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Mosheh, “Go in to Far’oh and tell him: ‘This is what the god of the Hebrews. Yahweh, says: Let my people go \add so\add* they can serve me.
\v 2 Certainly if you’re unwilling to release them and if you keep holding onto them,
\v 3 then listen. Yahweh is about to \add inflict\add* a very serious plague on your livestock which are in the fields—on the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the cattle, and on the flock.
\v 4 \add But\add* Yahweh will distinguish between the livestock of the Israelis and the Egyptians—none of the Israelis’ animals will die.’ ”
\v 5 Then Yahweh \add said when it would happen\add*, “Yahweh will do this \add to Egypt\add* tomorrow.”
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* the next day Yahweh did \add what he’d said\add* and all of the livestock of the Egyptians died, yet none at all from the livestock of the Israelis died.
\v 7 Far’oh sent \add people to investigate\add*, and wow, not even one of the livestock of the Israelis had died. \add But\add* Far’oh was strong-willed and wouldn’t let the people go.
\s1 Plague 6: Boils
\p
\v 8 Then Yahweh told Mosheh and Aharon, “Take handfuls of ash out of a furnace, then Mosheh should \add toss it up in the air in front\add* of Far’oh.
\v 9 It will become a powder over all Egypt and then it will turn into boils—bursting blisters—on people and on animals all over Egypt.”
\v 10 \add So\add* they took some ash from a furnace, and standing in front of Far’oh, Mosheh \add tossed it up into the air\add* and it turned into boils with bursting blisters on the people and the animals.\x + \xo 9:10: \xt Rev 16:2.\x*
\v 11 Because of the boils, the sorcerers weren’t \add even\add* able to stand \add there with\add* Mosheh because the sorcerers \add suffered with them\add* along with all the Egyptians.
\v 12 \add But\add* Yahweh caused Far’oh to remain stubborn and he didn’t listen to them, just as Yahweh had told Mosheh \add previously\add*.
\s1 Plague 7: Hail
\p
\v 13 Then Yahweh told Mosheh, “Get up early in the morning, and stand in front of Far’oh and say to him, ‘This is what Yahweh, the god of the Hebrews, says: Let my people go so they can serve me
\v 14 because this time, I’m about to send all my plagues to you and your servants, and your people. \add You’ll all be deeply distressed by them\add*, in order that you might know that there is no \add one else\add* like me in all the world.
\v 15 \add By this time\add*, I could have reached out and struck you and your people with such a plague that you would all have been obliterated from the land.
\v 16 However, I’ve kept you for this reason: to show you my power and in order to proclaim my name all over the world.\x + \xo 9:16: \xt Rom 9:17.\x*
\v 17 You’re still considering yourself to be greater than my people by failing to release them.
\v 18 \add Now\add* listen: I’m about to cause extremely heavy hail to rain \add down\add* at this time tomorrow. \add It’ll be hail like\add* which has never been \add seen before\add* in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
\v 19 \add So\add* send for your livestock and everything you own in the country now, and bring it in under cover because the hail will come down on every person and animal that is found in the countryside and not \add sheltering under a roof\add*, and they will die.’ ”
\v 20 Some of Far’oh’s servants who believed what Yahweh said, quickly brought their slaves and their livestock back into their houses,
\v 21 but those \add people\add* who didn’t believe Yahweh \add just\add* left their slaves and their animals out in the countryside.
\p
\v 22 “Raise your arm up toward the sky,” Yahweh told Mosheh, “and hail \add will strike\add* all over Egypt—on the people and animals and on every plant in the Egyptian countryside.”
\v 23 \add So\add* Mosheh lifted his staff to the sky, and Yahweh sent thunder and hail, and \add lightning caused fires\add* on the land, and \add so\add* Yahweh rained hail \add down\add* onto Egypt.
\v 24 There was hail, and \add also\add* fire coming \add down\add* in the middle of the hail. It was very heavy, such as had never been in all of Egypt since it became a nation.\x + \xo 9:24: \xt Rev 8:7; 16:21.\x*
\v 25 The hail struck everything in Egypt—everything that was in the countryside, from people to animals. \add It also\add* struck every plant and broke every tree \add out\add* in the countryside.
\v 26 Only in the Goshen region where the Israelis were, was there no hail.
\p
\v 27 Then Far’oh sent for Mosheh and Aharon and told them, “I’ve sinned this time. Yahweh is righteous, and me and my people are guilty.
\v 28 Pray to Yahweh \add to stop it,\add* because the thunder of God and hail are too much. Then I’ll release you all—you won’t have to remain \add here\add*.”
\p
\v 29 “As I’m leaving the city,” Mosheh \add replied\add*, “I’ll spread my palms \add out\add* to Yahweh. The thunder will stop and the hail won’t continue so that you \add will be able to see\add* that the earth belongs to Yahweh.
\v 30 \add But as for\add* you and your servants, I know that you still don’t fear Yahweh God.”
\p
\v 31 (\add Now\add* the flax and the barley were \add flattened by the hail\add* because the barley was \add full grown and starting to fill out\add* and the flax was in bloom.
\v 32 But the wheat and the spelt weren’t \add destroyed because they come later in the season\add*.)
\p
\v 33 \add So\add* Mosheh left Far’oh, and as he was leaving the city, he spread his palms \add out\add* to Yahweh and the thunder and hail ceased, and the rain stopped pouring down on the land.
\v 34 \add But when\add* Far’oh saw that the rain and hail and thunder had stopped, he added to his sins and he \add firmed his resolve\add*—he and his servants.
\v 35 And \add so\add* Far’oh \add remained stubborn\add* and didn’t let the Israelis leave, just as Yahweh had said through Mosheh \add previously\add*.
\c 10
\s1 Plague 8: Locusts
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh told Mosheh, “Go in to Far’oh because I’ve made him and his servants \add stubborn\add* in order to \add be able to\add* demonstrate these miracles of mine among them,
\v 2 and so that \add in the future you’ll be able to tell your descendants\add* that I \add made\add* Egypt \add look foolish\add*, and my miracles which I demonstrated among them—and \add so that\add* you will know that I am Yahweh.”
\p
\v 3 \add So\add* Mosheh and Aharon went in to Far’oh and told him, “This is what Yahweh, God of the Hebrews says: \add how long before you’ll submit to me\add*? Let my people go \add so\add* they can serve me,
\v 4 because if you refuse to release them, then listen, I’ll bring locusts into your territory tomorrow.
\v 5 They’ll cover the ground so that no one will \add even\add* be able to see it, and they’ll devour whatever remains after the hail. Plus they’ll devour every tree growing in the countryside.
\v 6 They’ll fill your houses and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians. It’ll be nothing like anything which your \add parents generation\add* ever saw, nor anything seen by the \add previous generations\add* from the day they came to be on the earth until today.” Then \add Mosheh\add* turned around and went out from Far’oh \add with Aharon\add*.
\p
\v 7 Then Far’oh’s servants \add asked\add* him, “How much longer is this \add going to cause trouble\add* for us? Let the men go and they’ll worship their God Yahweh. Don’t you understand yet that Egypt \add is being destroyed\add*?”
\p
\v 8 \add So\add* Mosheh and Aharon were brought back to Far’oh, and he told them, “Go and worship your God Yahweh. Who \add are the ones\add* who’ll be going?”
\p
\v 9 “We’ll take our children and our old folks,” Mosheh \add answered\add*. “We’ll go with our sons and daughters, and with our flocks and herds, because the festival of Yahweh is for \add all of\add* us.”
\p
\v 10 “\add You’d need Yahweh with you if I ever\add* let you and your children go \add together\add*,” Far’oh \add responded\add*. “You’re clearly \add plotting an evil trick\add*!
\v 11 \add Well that won’t happen!\add* The men may go and worship Yahweh since that’s what you’ve been wanting.” Then he drove them \add out of the room\add*.
\p
\v 12 Then Yahweh told Mosheh, “Extend your hand over Egypt and let \add the locusts\add* rise up over the land, and let \add them\add* devour all the plants—everything which the hail had spared.”
\v 13 \add So\add* Mosheh stretched his staff out over Egypt, and Yahweh sent an east wind over the land all that day and all night. Then morning came, and the east wind had brought the locusts.
\v 14 The locusts covered across all the land of Egypt and came to rest everywhere within the \add country’s\add* borders. They were extremely numerous—never before were there so many locusts, and it’ll never be \add repeated again\add*.\x + \xo 10:14-15: \xt Rev 9:2-3.\x*
\v 15 \add The cloud of locusts blocked the sun\add* and \add prevented people from being able to see very far\add*. They devoured all the plants on the land and all of the fruit on the trees that the hail had left, and \add no piece\add* of greenery remained on any tree or plant in the entire Egyptian countryside.
\p
\v 16 Far’oh quickly summoned Mosheh and Aharon and said, “I’ve sinned against your God Yahweh and against you.
\v 17 So now just this once, please \add overlook\add* my sin and pray to your God Yahweh and just let him take this \add deathly plague\add* away from me.”
\v 18 \add So Mosheh\add* left Far’oh and went out and prayed to Yahweh,
\v 19 and Yahweh \add caused\add* a very strong sea wind. \add The wind\add* carried away the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea—not a single locust remained anywhere in Egyptian territory.
\v 20 \add But\add* Yahweh caused Far’oh \add to remain stubborn\add* and he wouldn’t release the Israelis.
\s1 Plague 9: Darkness
\p
\v 21 Then Yahweh told Mosheh, “Raise your hand up toward the sky and let it become dark over all Egypt—darkness \add that can be felt\add*.”
\v 22 \add So\add* Mosheh stretched his hand out \add towards\add* the sky, and a \add thick\add* darkness was in all Egypt for three days.\x + \xo 10:22: \xt Psa 105:28; Rev 16:10.\x*
\v 23 No one could see \add anyone else\add*, and for three days no one was able to go anywhere, yet there was light in \add the region where\add* the Israelis lived.
\p
\v 24 Then Far’oh summoned Mosheh and told him, “Go serve Yahweh. Your children can go with you all, \add but\add* your flocks and your herds must remain behind.”
\p
\v 25 “On top of that,” Mosheh \add responded\add*, “you must also give us the sacrifices and offerings to be burnt when we will \add sacrifice to\add* Yahweh our God.
\v 26 And even our livestock needs to go with us. Not a hoof will be left behind because we’ll \add choose\add* from them to serve Yahweh our god. \add You see\add*, we won’t know what we must \add sacrifice to\add* Yahweh until we arrive there.”
\p
\v 27 \add But\add* Yahweh caused Far’oh to \add strengthen his resolve\add* and he wouldn’t agree to let them go.
\v 28 “Get \add out of here\add*!” Far’oh \add shouted\add*. “And watch yourself! You’ll never see me again, because if I ever see you again, I’ll \add have you executed\add*!”
\p
\v 29 “\add Yes,\add*” Mosheh responded. “It’s just as you say: I’ll never see you again!”
\c 11
\s1 Plague 10: Death of oldest sons
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh told Mosheh, “I’ll send one more plague to Far’oh and Egypt. After that he’ll let you all go from here. \add What’s more,\add* when he does he’ll actually chase you all right out of here.
\v 2 \add Go and\add* quietly tell the people that both men and women should ask their \add Egyptian\add* neighbours for items of gold and silver.”
\v 3 Then Yahweh gave the \add Israelis\add* favour in the eyes of the Egyptians. What’s more, Mosheh was very prestigious in the eyes of Far’oh’s servants and in the eyes of the Egyptian people.
\p
\v 4 Then Mosheh told \add Far’oh\add*, “This is what Yahweh says: Sometime around the middle of the night I’ll go out \add around\add* Egypt,
\v 5 and every oldest son in Egypt will die, from the oldest son of Far’oh who sits on his throne, to the oldest son of the slave girl who \add lives\add* behind the mill, as well as every oldest male offspring of \add your livestock\add*.
\v 6 Then there’ll be loud wailing right across Egypt which will be nothing anything that’s ever happened before, and nothing like it will \add ever\add* happen again.
\v 7 But \add amongst the Israelis\add*, \add the dogs won’t growl at any person or animals\add* so that you’ll know that Yahweh distinguishes between Egypt and Yisrael.
\v 8 Then all your servants will come down to me, and they’ll bow to me, \add pleading\add*, ‘Go, you and all the people who \add follow you\add*.’ And after that I’ll \add leave Egypt\add*.” Then \add Mosheh\add* \add left\add* Far’oh \add in a fiery rage\add*.
\p
\v 9 Then Yahweh told Mosheh, “Far’oh \add refused to\add* listen to you, so that I’m able to multiply my miracles in Egypt.”
\v 10 Mosheh and Aharon had done all those miracles in front of Far’oh \add but\add* Yahweh \add had made Far’oh stubborn so\add* he hadn’t let the \add Israelis leave his country\add*.
\c 12
\s1 Meal preparations to avoid death
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh told Mosheh and Aharon in Egypt,\x + \xo 12:1-13: \xt Lev 23:5; Num 9:1-5; 28:16; Deu 16:1-2.\x*
\v 2 “This month is to become the beginning of the months for you all—\add from now on\add* it will be the first month of the \add new\add* year.
\v 3 Assemble the people and tell them that on the tenth of this month, every man who’s the head of the household must select a lamb or young goat \add for his family\add*.
\v 4 \add But\add* if the household’s too small \add to cook\add* a whole animal, then \add neighbours can combine and share—budgeting\add* on how much each person eats.
\v 5 You all can choose either a sheep or a goat, but it must be a perfect, one-year-old male—without any defects.
\v 6 You all must \add take special care of those animals\add* until the fourteenth day of this month, then \add every Israeli household\add* will slaughter \add their animal early\add* that evening.
\v 7 Then they must take some of the blood and put it on both doorposts and on the lintel of the houses that they’ll be in when they eat it.
\v 8 They must roast them on the fire and eat the meat that night, along with flat bread and bitter herbs.
\v 9 Don’t eat any of the meat raw and don’t boil it in water—it must be roasted over the fire with its head, legs, and internal organs.
\v 10 Nothing must be left by morning—anything that’s \add not eaten\add* must be burnt in the fire.
\v 11 And this is how you all must eat it: with your belts fastened on your waists, your sandals on your feet, and your staffs in your hands. You all must eat it in a hurry. It is the Passover to Yahweh.
\p
\v 12 Then during that night, I will move throughout Egypt and I will \add kill\add* all the \add oldest males\add*—\add both people and animals\add*. I will \add execute\add* judgement on all the gods of Egypt. I am Yahweh.
\v 13 That blood \add on the doorposts and lintel\add* will be your sign on the houses which you are all in. I will see the blood and will pass over above you all, and the plague won’t \add affect\add* you all with destruction as I strike against Egypt.
\v 14 Then this day will become a memorial for you all, and you’ll celebrate it as a festival to Yahweh for \add future\add* generations—a statute that you’ll all celebrate forever.\x + \xo 12:14-20: \xt Exo 23:15; 34:18; Lev 23:6-8; Num 28:17-25; Deu 16:3-8.\x*
\s1 The ‘Flat Bread Celebration’
\p
\v 15 For seven days you all must only eat flat bread \add made without yeast\add*. Yes, on the first day you all must remove any yeast from your houses, because anyone who eats bread with yeast during those seven days, that person must be permanently driven out of Yisrael.
\v 16 On the first day, you all must gather for a sacred assembly, and \add similarly\add* on the seventh day. No work can be done on those \add days\add* \add other than meal preparation\add*.
\v 17 You all must \add regularly\add* observe the \it Flat Bread \add Celebration\add*\it*, because on this very day I will have brought your divisions out from Egypt. You all must observe this day throughout \add future\add* generations—a statute that you’ll all celebrate forever.
\v 18 Starting on 14th of the first month in the evening, you all must eat \add only\add* flat bread until the 21st day of the month in the evening.
\v 19 For seven days you all must have no yeast in your homes, because anyone who eats bread with yeast in it, that person \add must be driven out\add* from the Israeli people whether they’re a foreigner or a native.
\v 20 You all mustn’t eat \add anything made with\add* yeast. Wherever you live, you all must only eat flat bread.
\s1 The first ever ‘pass-over’ celebration
\p
\v 21 Then Mosheh summoned the Israeli elders and told them, “Go ahead and select a lamb or young goat for each family and slaughter it.
\v 22 Then you all must take a bunch of \add leafy\add* hyssop \add stalks\add*, and dip it in the basin \add with the blood from the sacrifice\add* and paint the blood onto the lintel and both doorposts. \add After that\add*, \add absolutely no one\add* should go out the door of your houses until morning.
\v 23 Then Yahweh will pass through \add out Egypt\add* to strike the Egyptians and \add when\add* he sees the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, \add he’ll\add* ‘pass over’ that doorway and won’t permit ‘the destroyer’ to enter into your houses to strike.\x + \xo 12:23: \xt Heb 11:28.\x*
\v 24 All of you and your descendants must maintain this as a law and celebrate it forever,
\v 25 \add so\add* when you all enter into the land that Yahweh will give to you just as he \add promised\add*, then you must \add observe\add* this ceremony.
\v 26 Then when it occurs, your children will ask, ‘What does this ceremony \add mean\add* to you?’
\v 27 you all must tell \add them\add*, ‘It’s the sacrifice of ‘pass-over’ to Yahweh, who passed over the houses of the Israelis in Egypt \add when he\add* struck the Egyptians and rescued our families.’ ”
\p And the people bowed their heads and prostrated themselves,
\v 28 and the Israelis went and did \add just\add* as Yahweh had commanded \add through\add* Mosheh and Aharon.
\s1 The death of all the oldest male offspring
\p
\v 29 Then, in the middle of the night, Yahweh struck all the oldest males in Egypt, from the oldest son of Far’oh who sat on his throne, to the firstborn of the \add prisoner in the dungeon\add* and all \add oldest male offspring\add* of the animals.\x + \xo 12:29: \xt Exo 4:22-23.\x*
\v 30 During the night, all the Egyptians got up, including Far’oh and all his servants. There was \add tremendous wailing throughout\add* Egypt because \add it was a very rare house\add* where there wasn’t someone dead.
\v 31 \add Far’oh\add* called for Mosheh and Aharon in the night and told \add them\add*, “Pack up and get out from among my people—you \add two\add* and all the other Israelis. Go and serve Yahweh as you’ve said.
\v 32 Also take your flocks and your herds as you’ve said, and go. And bless me as well.
\p
\v 33 The Egyptians urged the \add Israelis\add*, hurrying to let them go from the land because they said, “We’re all dying.”
\p
\v 34 \add So\add* the people carried their \add bread\add* dough before it \add could rise\add*. Their bread-making bowls were wrapped in their clothes on their shoulders.
\p
\v 35 The Israelis did everything that Mosheh had instructed them, \add including\add* asking for items of gold and silver, and clothing from the Egyptians.\x + \xo 12:35-36: \xt Exo 3:21-22.\x*
\v 36 Yahweh gave the people favour in the eyes of the Egyptians, \add so by\add* their requests, they were able to strip the Egyptians of their wealth.
\p
\v 37 Then the Israelis walked from Rameses toward Succoth—about 600,000 strong men on foot, not counting \add women and\add* children.
\v 38 A large assortment of other people also went with them, along with large numbers of sheep and goats, and cattle.
\p
\v 39 They baked the dough that they brought from Egypt into flat bread since it \add hadn’t had time to rise\add*,\f + \fr 12:39 \ft Most modern readers probably visualise yeast bought from a supermarket when ‘leaven’ (or even ‘yeast’) is mentioned in a Bible translation. However, it’s much more likely that each day, a portion of the bread dough was set aside for the natural yeasts (think ‘sour dough’ bread) to accumulate, and then mixed into the new batch of dough the next day and left for the natural yeasts to work and rise the dough. The text here implies that it’s possible that the Hebrew word translated ‘unleavened’ really meant ‘unrisen’ on that first ‘pass-over’ night.\f* because they were driven out of Egypt \add in a hurry\add* and hadn’t \add had time to prepare food to take\add*.
\p
\v 40 The descendants of Yisra’el \add (Yacob)\add* had lived in Egypt for 430 years\x + \xo 12:40: \xt Gen 15:13; Gal 3:17.\x*
\v 41 to the day, because that very day was when all the \add various\add* divisions of Yahweh’s \add people\add* left Egypt.
\v 42 It was a \add time\add* when they stayed awake all night as Yahweh took them out of Egypt—a night to be observed in that same way by every future generation.
\s1 Instructions for observing the ‘pass-over’
\p
\v 43 Then Yahweh told Mosheh and Aharon, “This is the statute of the ‘pass-over’: No foreigners may \add share in\add* the meal \add that night\add*,
\v 44 unless it’s a slave that you bought and who’s been circumcised—
\v 45 no foreigner or hired helper can \add join in\add* the meal.
\v 46 \add Each animal\add* must be eaten in only one house—don’t take any of the meat outside. And don’t break any of the animals bones.\x + \xo 12:46: \xt Num 9:12; Yhn 19:36.\x*
\v 47 Every Israeli must observe it,
\v 48 and if someone is living among you and wants to join in Yahweh’s ‘pass-over’, then every male in their family must be circumcised. Only then will they be allowed to observe it, and then they should be considered like a native of the land. No uncircumcised person may eat it.
\v 49 This one law will apply to both the natives, and those who live among you all.”
\v 50 All the Israelis followed those instructions that Yahweh had given through Mosheh and Aharon,
\v 51 and \add so\add* on that very day, Yahweh took all the Israelis out of Egypt \add grouped\add* by their \add family\add* divisions.
\c 13
\s1 God owns the first child
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh told Mosheh,
\v 2 “All firstborn \add offspring\add* are to be consecrated to me—the first product of every womb, whether human or animal, belongs to me.”\x + \xo 13:2: \xt Num 3:13; Luk 2:23.\x*
\s1 The ‘Flat Bread Celebration’
\p
\v 3 Then Mosheh told the people, “\add Always\add* remember this day, that you went out of Egypt, \add rescued\add* from slavery, because Yahweh \add used his power\add* to bring you out from there. And \add nothing with yeast in it\add* can be eaten \add when you celebrate this\add*.
\v 4 Today you are leaving in the month of Aviv,
\v 5 and \add when\add* Yahweh brings you to the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and the Yebusites (which he swore to your fathers to give to you—a land flowing with milk and honey) you must observe this ceremony in this \add same\add* month.
\v 6 You must eat \add only\add* flat bread for seven days, and then on the seventh day, it will be a festival to \add honour\add* Yahweh.
\v 7 \add Again,\add* you must only eat flat bread for seven days—\add not only that\add* you mustn’t \add even have\add* any risen bread, nor must you have any yeast within any of your borders.
\v 8 On that \add festival\add* day, you must tell your \add children\add*, ‘This is because of what Yahweh did for \add us\add* when \add we left\add* Egypt.’
\v 9 It’ll be \add like a reminder written\add* on your hand and a \add prompt in front\add* of your eyes, so that \add you’ll remember to pass on\add* Yahweh’s instructions because \add he\add* \add used his power\add* to bring you out of Egypt.
\v 10 \add So\add* you must \add follow those instructions\add* at the appointed time \add year after year\add*.
\s1 Offering up the oldest children
\p
\v 11 Later, when Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanites as he promised to you and your ancestors, and he gives it to you,
\v 12 then hand over to Yahweh all oldest children, and all the oldest animal offspring that are yours. The males are for Yahweh.\x + \xo 13:12: \xt Exo 34:19-20; Luk 2:23.\x*
\v 13 In the case of the oldest donkey foal, you must buy it back \add by killing a lamb\add* instead of it. If you don’t buy it back, you must kill the donkey by breaking its neck. You \em must\em* buy back every one of your oldest sons,
\v 14 and \add in the future\add* when your son asks you, ‘What’s that about?’ then you must tell him, ‘\add We were enslaved in Egypt, but Yahweh used his incredible power\add* to bring us out.
\v 15 And so it was that when Far’oh was too stubborn to let us go, then Yahweh struck all of the oldest sons and oldest male animals in Egypt. That’s why \add we\add* offer all the oldest offspring to Yahweh, and why \add we need to buy back\add* all our oldest sons.’
\v 16 \add So\add* you must place a reminder on your hand and hanging on your forehead that Yahweh used his incredible power to bring us out of Egypt.”
\s1 Led by cloud and fire
\p
\v 17 When Far’oh released the people, God didn’t lead them through the land of the Philistines, although \add that way\add* was shorter, because \add he\add* said, “\add It’s best if the people don’t have to face war immediately, or they might change their minds\add* and \add then want to\add* return to Egypt.”
\v 18 \add So\add* God caused the people to take the path going towards the wilderness and the Red Sea.\f + \fr 13:18 \ft Probably towards the \em Gulf of Suez\em*: see https://armstronginstitute.org/339-where-did-the-red-sea-crossing-take-place.\f* The Israeli left Egypt \add in formation as if ready for battle\add*.
\p
\v 19 Mosheh \add ensured that\add* the bones of Yosef were taken with \add them\add*, because \add many years back\add* \add Yosef\add* had made the Israelis vow, saying, “God will certainly take notice of you all, and you must take my bones up with you from here.”\x + \xo 13:19: \xt Gen 50:25; Josh 24:32.\x*
\p
\v 20 The people travelled on from Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
\v 21 During the day, Yahweh went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to lead them on the way, and at nighttime, he went in a pillar of fire to be light to them, \add so they could travel both\add* in the daytime and at night.
\v 22 The daytime pillar of cloud and the nighttime pillar of fire didn’t ever leave their place in front of the people.
\c 14
\s1 Crossing the Red Sea
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh told Mosheh,
\v 2 “Tell the Israelis that they should turn and camp in front of Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, in front of Baal-Zephon. You all are to camp by the sea opposite it.
\v 3 Then Far’oh will say, ‘They are confused \add and lost\add*—the wilderness has boxed them in.’
\v 4 I’ll strengthen Far’oh’s \add resolve\add* and he’ll chase after them. Then because of Far’oh and all his army, I’ll be \add honoured\add* and the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh.” \add So the Israelis camped where they were instructed\add*.
\p
\v 5 When the king of Egypt was told that the Israelis had fled, \add he\add* and his servants \add started thinking about their own\add* people and they asked, “What have we done by letting the Israeli slaves go free?”
\v 6 Then he hitched up his chariot and took his \add army\add* with him.
\v 7 He took 600 of the best chariots as well as all the other Egyptian chariots and officers \add to supervise\add* them.
\v 8 Yahweh strengthened the Egyptian king’s resolve and so Far’oh pursued after the Israelis after they had confidently marched out \add of Egypt\add*.
\v 9 The Egyptians pursued them and all of Far’oh’s horses and chariots, along with his mounted soldiers and his foot army, overtook them camping above the sea above Pi Hahiroth, across from Baal-Zephon.
\p
\v 10 As \add the Egyptians\add* approached, the Israelis looked back, and \add to their horror\add*, saw the army coming after them. They were extremely afraid and cried out to Yahweh.
\v 11 They \add complained\add* to Mosheh, “Is it because there weren’t any graves in Egypt that you brought us here to die in the wilderness? What have you done to us? Why did you bring us out from Egypt?
\v 12 Isn’t this \add exactly what we told\add* you in Egypt when we said, ‘\add Just leave us alone\add* and let us serve the Egyptians’? Because serving the Egyptians \add sounds a lot\add* better to us than dying \add out here\add* in the wilderness.”
\p
\v 13 Then Mosheh told the people, “You mustn’t be afraid. Stand still and see how Yahweh saves you all—he’s going to do it today, because any Egyptians that you see today, you’ll never, ever see them again.
\v 14 Yahweh himself will fight for you all—all you need to do is to remain calm.”
\v 15 Then Yahweh \add scolded\add* Mosheh, “Why are you \add still here\add* crying out to me? Talk to the Israelis and get them moving forward.
\v 16 As for you, raise your staff and stretch your arm out over the sea and divide it. Then the Israelis will go on onto dry ground through the middle of the sea.
\v 17 \add Yes, watch me!\add* I’ll strengthen the resolve of the Egyptians and they’ll enter \add between the sea\add* after them. Then I’ll be honoured because of \add what will happen to\add* Far’oh and all his army, and his chariots and his horsemen.
\v 18 \add Because of that,\add* the Egyptians will know that I’m Yahweh.”
\p
\v 19 Then God’s messenger who travelled ahead of the Israelis, moved and went behind them. \add Also\add* the pillar of cloud moved from in front of them and stood behind them
\v 20 and \add so\add* it was then between the \add coming\add* Egyptians and the Israelis. Then the cloud became darkness \add on the Egyptian side\add*, \add yet it lit up the other side\add*, and no one could approach it all night.
\v 21 Then Mosheh stretched his arm out over the sea and Yahweh sent a strong east wind. It blew all night and divided the sea \add on each side\add* and dried the \add strip of\add* land in the middle.
\v 22 \add So\add* then the Israelis entered through the middle of the sea on dry ground with a wall of water on each side of them.\x + \xo 14:22: \xt 1Cor 10:1-2; Heb 11:29.\x*
\v 23 \add However,\add* the Egyptians pursued after them. Every one of Far’oh’s horses and chariots and his horsemen \add also\add* entered into the middle of the sea.
\v 24 \add By now morning was coming\add* and Yahweh looked down through the pillar of fire and cloud, and he caused confusion for the Egyptian army.
\v 25 He caused the wheels of their chariots to turn unevenly \add so they became difficult\add* to drive, and the Egyptians \add complained\add*, “Let’s retreat from \add following\add* the Israelis, because Yahweh is fighting against Egypt and for them.”
\p
\v 26 \add On the other side,\add* Yahweh told Mosheh, “Stretch your arm out over the sea and the waters will \add flow back\add* onto the Egyptians and onto \add Far’oh’s\add* chariots and his horsemen.”
\v 27 \add So\add* Mosheh stretched his arm out over the sea, and as the day broke, the sea began to return to its normal place. The Egyptians \add turned and\add* fled before its impact \add but\add* Yahweh shook the Egyptians \add off their horses and chariots\add* in the middle of the sea.
\v 28 \add So\add* the sea returned and covered the chariots and the horsemen—even Far’oh’s entire army that had entered into the sea after \add the Israelis\add*. Not even one of \add the pursuers\add* remained.
\v 29 \add But\add* the Israelis had walked through the middle of the sea on dry land with a wall of water on each side of them.
\p
\v 30 \add So\add* Yahweh saved Yisrael from Egypt’s power that day, and the Israelis saw the Egyptians’ bodies \add washed up\add* on the shore.
\v 31 \add All of\add* Yisrael saw the \add incredible power\add* that Yahweh had used against the Egyptians, and the people revered Yahweh, and put their trust in him and his servant Mosheh.
\c 15
\s1 Mosheh’s song
\p
\v 1 Then Mosheh and the Israelis sang this song to Yahweh:\x + \xo 15:1: \xt Rev 15:3.\x*
\q1 “I will sing to Yahweh because he’s been so successful—
\q1 he’s thrown both the horses and their riders into the sea.
\q1
\v 2 I will sing about Yahweh, my source of strength,\x + \xo 15:2: \xt Psa 118:14; Isa 12:2.\x*
\q2 and the one who saves me.
\q1 I will praise him because he’s my god—
\q1 he’s my father’s God and I will honour him.
\q1
\v 3 Yahweh is a warrior.
\q1 Yahweh is his name.
\b
\q1
\v 4 He threw Far’oh’s chariots and his army into the sea.
\q1 His hand-picked officers have been sunk in the sea.
\b
\q1
\v 5 The deep waters cover them.
\q1 They descended into the depths like a stone.
\q1
\v 6 Yahweh’s right arm is so powerful.
\q1 Yahweh’s right arm shattered our enemy.
\q1
\v 7 You toss away your adversaries with your great power.
\q1 Your burning anger consumes them like straw \add in a fire\add*.
\q1
\v 8 It was your breath that made the waters pile up.
\q1 They stood up like a heap.
\q1 The deep water seemed like it was solid.
\q1
\v 9 Our enemies thought that they could chase after us and overtake us.
\q1 They had planned to satisfy themselves by sharing out the plunder.
\q1 They were ready to use their swords and swing their arms to destroy us.
\q1
\v 10 \add But\add* you blew with your breath.
\q1 The sea covered them.
\q1 They sank like lead in that \add terrible surge\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 11 Which other God is like you, Yahweh?
\q1 Who else is so powerful and yet sinless,
\q2 receiving praises for doing miracles?
\q1
\v 12 You stretched out your powerful arm.
\q1 The earth swallowed them up.
\q1
\v 13 You are leading the people you bought back,
\q2 because you committed yourself to love them.
\q1 You used your strength to lead them to your \add sinless\add* home.
\q1
\v 14 Other countries have heard, and they tremble.
\q1 Anguish has struck the inhabitants of Filistia.
\q1
\v 15 The chiefs of Edom have panicked.
\q1 Trembling has seized the leaders of Moab.
\q1 The inhabitants of Kanaan have melted away.
\q1
\v 16 Terror and dread have fallen on them.
\q1 \add After seeing\add* your great power, they’ve stayed as still as stone
\q2 until your people have all marched past, Yahweh.
\q1 Until the people you bought have all gone past \add them\add*.
\q1
\v 17 Bring them into \add the land\add*
\q2 and establish them on the mountain of your inheritance.
\q1 The place you’ve chosen to become your home, Yahweh—
\q2 a sanctuary built by your hands, master.
\q1
\v 18 Yahweh will reign \add as king\add* forever and ever.
\q1
\v 19 Far’oh’s horse went into the sea, along with his chariots and horsemen,\f + \fr 15:19 \ft Some interpreters include v19 as part of Mosheh’s song (as we do, although it does seem less poetic in structure), while others don’t. (There’s no speech marks in the ancient Hebrew texts.)\f*
\q1 and Yahweh brought the water back over them,
\q1 \add after\add* the Israelis had walked through on dry ground in the middle of the sea.”
\s1 Miryam’s song
\p
\v 20 Then Aharon’s sister Miryam who was a prophetess, picked up a tambourine and went outside. All the other women did likewise and followed her out to dance together
\v 21 \add so\add* Miryam sang this response:
\q1 “Sing to Yahweh and tell of his amazing victory—
\q1 He tossed the horses and their riders into the sea.”
\s1 The bitter water
\p
\v 22 Then Mosheh lead the Israelis away from the Red Sea and they moved into the wilderness at Shur. They went through the wilderness for three days and \add finally\add* found some water,
\v 23 but it was so bitter that they couldn’t drink it. So they named that place ‘Marah’ \add (which means ‘bitter’)\add*,
\v 24 and the people grumbled about Mosheh saying, “\add So\add* what will we drink \add then\add*?”
\v 25 \add So\add* Mosheh cried out to Yahweh, and Yahweh showed him a tree. When he threw it into the water, the water became \add safe to drink\add*.
\p \add Yahweh\add* made a statue at that place, and a rule, and he tested \add Mosheh\add* there,
\v 26 saying, “If you carefully listen to the voice of Yahweh your god, and you do what’s right in my eyes, and you listen to my commands and you keep all of my laws, then I won’t inflict you with any of the diseases that I put on the Egyptians, because I’m Yahweh your healer.”

\v 1 Then they left Elim, and all the Israelis entered into the wilderness at Siyn (between Elim and Sinai) \add around six weeks\add* after leaving Egypt,
\v 2 and all the Israelis murmured against Mosheh and Aharon \add there\add* in the wilderness,
\v 3 saying, “If only \add Yahweh had killed us\add* in Egypt, \add where we’d be\add* sitting by a pot of meat eating bread until we’re full, because you’ve brought us out into this wilderness to \add starve us all to death\add*.”
\p
\v 4 Then Yahweh told Mosheh, “\add Just\add* watch me make food rain down from the sky for you all. Then the people will be able to go out every day and gather enough for that day so that I can test them: Will they obey my law or not?\x + \xo 16:4: \xt Yhn 6:31.\x*
\v 5 \add But every Friday\add* they can \add gather and\add* prepare twice as much as what they gather on the other days.”
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* Mosheh and Aharon told all the Israelis, “This evening you’ll all know that Yahweh was the one who brought you out from Egypt.
\v 7 In the morning you’ll all see Yahweh’s greatness as he’s heard your murmurings against \add him\add*. \add I mean,\add* who are we that you’d murmur against \em us\em*?”
\v 8 Then Mosheh continued, “So Yahweh will give you all meat to eat in the evening and enough bread in the morning to make you all full. \add Yes,\add* Yahweh has heard your murmurings against him. As for us, \add we’re insignificant\add*. Your murmuring isn’t against us, but against Yahweh.”
\p
\v 9 Then Mosheh told Aharon, “Summon everyone to come and face Yahweh, because he’s heard their murmurings.”
\v 10 And so while Aharon spoke to all the Israelis, they turned toward the wilderness, and wow, Yahweh’s \add dazzling brightness\add* appeared in the cloud!
\v 11 Then Yahweh told Mosheh,
\v 12 “I’ve heard the murmurings of the Israelis. Speak to them saying, ‘In the evenings, you’ll all eat meat, and in the mornings you’ll all be satisfied with bread. Then you’ll all know that I’m your god, Yahweh.’ ”
\p
\v 13 And so that evening, quail appeared and covered the camp. And in the morning, \add something like\add* dew was lying all around the camp,
\v 14 and when it evaporated, wow, it left behind thin flakes—thin like frost on the ground there in the wilderness.
\v 15 \add When\add* the Israelis saw it, \add they asked each other\add*, ‘What is it?’ because they didn’t know what it was.
\p And Mosheh told them, “It’s the food that Yahweh has given you all to eat.\x + \xo 16:15: \xt 1Cor 10:3.\x*
\v 16 \add These are Yahweh’s instructions\add*: Gather enough of it according to how many people you’re feeding—about two litres per person who lives in your tents.”
\p
\v 17 \add So\add* the Israelis went ahead and gathered it—some collecting a lot, and others, less,
\v 18 \add but\add* when they measured it out, those who’d collected a lot didn’t have any extra, and those who hadn’t gathered so much still had enough to eat—each person had gathered just enough.\x + \xo 16:18: \xt 2Cor 8:15.\x*
\v 19 Then Mosheh told them, “Don’t save any of it for tomorrow,”
\v 20 \add but some of\add* them didn’t take any notice of him and kept it until the next morning. However, by then it was full of maggots and smelt rotten, and Mosheh was very angry at them.
\p
\v 21 \add So from that day onwards,\add* they gathered it every morning, depending on how many they were feeding, and then when the sun got hot, \add the rest\add* melted \add away\add*.
\v 22 On the \add Friday\add*, they gathered twice as much—around \add four litres\add* for each person—and all the leaders of the community came and informed Mosheh
\v 23 and he told them, “This is what Yahweh said: Tomorrow is a rest day to be set aside for Yahweh. \add So bake or cook your food, and keep the left-overs overnight to use in\add* the morning.”\x + \xo 16:23: \xt Exo 20:8-11.\x*
\v 24 \add So\add* they did what Mosheh had told them and kept the left-overs until the morning, and it didn’t stink or have any bugs in it.
\v 25 On that Saturday morning, Mosheh told them, “Go ahead and eat the previously cooked food because today is set aside for Yahweh and so you all won’t find any more \add on the ground\add*—
\v 26 you’ll gather it for six days \add each week\add*, but on the Saturday, there won’t be any.”
\p
\v 27 \add However,\add* some people did go out to collect it, but they couldn’t find any,
\v 28 and Yahweh said to Mosheh, “For how long will you all keep refusing to obey my commands and my laws?
\v 29 Listen, Yahweh has given you the Rest Day, so on the Friday he gives you food for two days. On the Saturday, everyone should stay where they are—there’s no need for anyone to go outside \add searching\add*.”
\v 30 So the people didn’t work on the Saturday.
\p
\v 31 The Israelis named it ‘manna’ \add (which sounds like Hebrew ‘What is it?’)\add*. It was white like coriander seed, and it tasted like wafers with honey.\x + \xo 16:31: \xt Num 11:7-8.\x*
\v 32 Then Mosheh said, “This is the procedure that Yahweh has commanded: Keep a full measure of it for preservation for your descendants so that they can see the food which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out from Egypt.”
\v 33 \add So\add* Mosheh said to Aharon, “Take a jar and fill it with the full two litres of manna. Place it in front of Yahweh for preservation for your descendants.”\x + \xo 16:33: \xt Heb 9:4.\x*
\v 34 \add So\add* Aharon \add prepared the jar and kept it\add* (and would \add eventually\add* place it \add in the box\add* with the \add stone tablets\add*.)
\v 35 The Israelis ate manna for forty years, until they \add eventually\add* \add left the wilderness\add* and came to the borders of the region of Canaan.\x + \xo 16:35: \xt Josh 5:12.\x*
\v 36 (Two litres is called an ‘omer’ which is a tenth of a ‘efah’.)
\c 17
\s1 God gives water from a rock
\r (Num. 20:1-13)
\p
\v 1 Then all the Israelis moved on from Siyn in the wilderness, travelling following Yahweh’s instructions. They camped at Refidim \add but\add* there was no water for the people to drink.\x + \xo 17:1-7: \xt Num 20:2-13.\x*
\v 2 \add So\add* the people argued with Mosheh \add again\add*, saying, “Give us water to drink!”
\p “Why are you all quarrelling with me?” Mosheh \add answered\add*. “Why are you all testing Yahweh?”
\p
\v 3 \add But\add* the people were \add very\add* thirsty there and \add they\add* murmured against Mosheh, \add so\add* he \add demanded\add*, “Is this why you brought us out of Egypt? To kill me and my sons and my cattle with thirst?” ???
\p
\v 4 Mosheh cried out to Yahweh, \add asking\add*, “What should I do for \add these\add* people? \add It won’t take much more\add* and they’ll stone me.”
\p
\v 5 “Walk on ahead of the people,” Yahweh told Mosheh, “and take some of the Israeli elders with you, and your staff—the one which you struck the river with. Take it in your hand and go.
\v 6 Watch me. I will stand \add in front of you\add* there on the rock at Horev \add (Mt. Sinai)\add*. Then you will strike the rock and water will come out of it, and the people will drink.” \add So\add* Mosheh did that while the Israeli elders watched.
\p
\v 7 \add Mosheh\add* named that place \add both\add* ‘Massah’ \add (which means ‘testing’)\add* and ‘Meribah’ \add (which means ‘complaining’)\add*, because of the conflict among the Israelis and because of how they tested of Yahweh by saying, ‘Is Yahweh among us or not?’
\s1 Mosheh’s arms held high to defeat Amalek
\p
\v 8 Then the Amalek \add army\add* came and attacked Yisrael at Refidim,
\v 9 and Mosheh instructed Yehoshua \add (Joshua)\add*, “Choose men for us and go out and fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I’ll be stationed on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.”
\v 10 \add So\add* Yehoshua \add prepared\add* to fight Amalek as Mosheh had told him, and Mosheh, Aharon, and Hur climbed up to the top of the hill.
\v 11 And so it happened that when Mosheh raised his arm, then Yisrael would be winning, \add but\add* when he \add lowered his arm\add*, then Amalek would start winning.
\v 12 \add However,\add* Mosheh’s arms got tired, so they got a \add large\add* stone and sat him on it, and Aharon and Hur stood on each side of him holding up his arms, and holding him steady in that position until the sun went down.
\v 13 \add So this was how\add* Yehoshua defeated Amalek and his army with \add their swords\add*.
\v 14 Then Yahweh told Mosheh, “Write this event in the book and \add read it aloud to\add* Yehoshua, because I will certainly blot out the memory of Amalek from \add off the earth\add*.”\x + \xo 17:14: \xt Deu 25:17-19; 1Sam 15:2-9.\x*
\v 15 Then Mosheh built an altar and he named it ‘Yahweh-nissi’ \add (which means ‘Yahweh is my banner’)\add*,
\v 16 saying, “Because \add they battled\add* against Yah’s throne, then Yahweh \add will battle\add* against Amalek from generation to generation.”
\c 18
\s1 Mosheh’s father-in-law visits
\p
\v 1 \add Now\add* Yetro (Jethro), the priest at Midian and Mosheh’s father-in-law, heard about everything that God had done for Mosheh and for his people the Israelis—that Yahweh had brought \add the Israelis\add* out of Egypt.
\v 2 (Yetro had \add been looking after\add* Mosheh’s wife Zipporah \add and their two sons\add* after he had sent her back\x + \xo 18:2-3: \xt Exo 2:21-22.\x*
\v 3 along with \add their\add* two sons. One was named ‘Gershom’ \add (which sounds like the Hebrew word for ‘foreigner’)\add* because \add Mosheh\add* had said, “I’ve been a foreigner living in another country.”\x + \xo 18:3: \xt Acts 7:29.\x*
\v 4 \add Their\add* other son’s name was ‘Eliezer’ \add (which sounds like the Hebrew word that means ‘God helps me’\add*, because Mosheh had said, “God, who my father worshipped, has helped me and \add stopped the Egyptian king Far’oh from killing me\add*.”))
\p
\v 5 \add So now\add* Mosheh’s father-in-law brought \add Mosheh’s\add* wife and sons to the wilderness where \add the people\add* were camping \add near\add* the mountain of God.
\v 6 \add He had sent a message ahead\add* saying, “I, your father-in-law Yetro, am coming to you, as well as your wife and \add your\add* two sons.”
\v 7 \add So\add* Mosheh went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down and kissed him. They asked each other about their welfare, then they went into the tent,
\v 8 and Mosheh related to his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Far’oh and to Egypt on account of Yisrael, all the hardship that found them along the way, and about how Yahweh had rescued them.
\v 9 Yetro \add was very happy to hear about\add* all the good \add things\add* that Yahweh had done for Yisrael when he had rescued them out from Egyptian control,
\v 10 and \add he\add* said, “Bless Yahweh, who rescued you from \add slavery\add* in Egypt, and from Far’oh’s power.
\v 11 Now I \add can see\add* that Yahweh is greater than all the \add other\add* gods because of the \add this result after\add* \add the Egyptians\add* had acted proudly against \add you all\add*.”
\v 12 Then Mosheh’s father-in-law Yetro made a burnt offering as well as sacrifices to God, and Aharon and all of the Israeli elders came to eat bread with Mosheh’s father-in-law \add in God’s presence\add*.
\s1 Yetro’s helpful administrative advice
\r (Deu. 1:9-18)
\p
\v 13 The following day, Mosheh sat down to judge the people, and the people stood around \add him\add* from morning until evening.
\v 14 When \add his\add* father-in-law noticed everything that he \add personally\add* did for the people, he \add asked\add*, “What’s this that you’re doing with the people? Why do you sit \add there\add* alone, and all the people position themselves around you from morning until evening?”
\p
\v 15 “Because the people come to me to \add find out what God wants for them\add*,” Mosheh replied to \add Yetro\add*.
\v 16 “When a \add difficult\add* situation comes up among them, someone comes to me and I make the judgement between a man and his neighbour. \add In addition,\add* I help them understand the god’s statutes and laws.”
\p
\v 17 “It’s not a good \add idea\add* what you’re doing,” said Yetro.
\v 18 “You’re definitely \add on the road to\add* wear yourself out, plus you’ll also wear out these people who are with you, because the \add responsibility\add* is too heavy for you—you can’t \add just\add* do it alone.
\v 19 Now, listen to \add this\add*: I’ll advise you and God will be with you. You be before God for the people, and you should bring their disputes to God yourself.
\v 20 You should \add also\add* teach them the statutes and the laws, and you should \add teach\add* them the way they should \add live\add* and the work that they should do.
\v 21 \add But\add* you yourself should search through all the people to find capable men who are godly and faithful, and not \add greedy for\add* dishonest profit. Then appoint \add the best of them\add* to be over a thousand \add households\add*, and then others to be over groups of one hundred, fifty, and ten \add households\add*.
\v 22 They’ll \add be the ones to\add* judge the people, except that every serious situation they’ll bring to you—they’ll judge every minor situation themselves. \add Yes,\add* you must lighten this load off yourself, and they’ll share the load with you.
\v 23 If you do that, and if God tells you \add to proceed\add*, then you’ll be able to endure \add in the long term\add*, plus all of these people \add standing around\add* will be able to return to their tents peacefully.”
\p
\v 24 \add So\add* Mosheh \add took his father-in-law’s advice\add* and \add implemented all of his suggestions\add*.
\v 25 \add He\add* chose capable men from among all the Israelis, and he appointed them as heads over the people: leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens \add of households\add*.
\v 26 They became the ones who settled most disputes for the people. They brought the difficult cases to Mosheh, \add but\add* they judged each minor situation themselves.
\p
\v 27 Then Mosheh bid farewell to \add Yetro\add* and he returned to his own home.
\c 19
\s1 Camping by Mt. Sinai
\p
\v 1 The Israelis entered the Sinai wilderness in the third month after exiting Egypt.
\v 2 \add After\add* they had departed from Refidim, they had entered the Sinai wilderness and camped there \add at the base\add* of the mountain.
\v 3 Yahweh called Mosheh from the mountain, so he climbed up and God gave him this message and asked him to pass it on to Yacob’s descendants, the Israelis:
\p
\v 4 “You yourselves saw what I did to the Egyptians—how I carried you on eagles’ wings and brought you all \add here\add* to myself.
\v 5 And now, if you all carefully listen to my \add words\add* and keep my agreement, then \add your nation\add* will be my possession, \add separate\add* from all the \add others\add*, because all the earth is mine,\x + \xo 19:5-6: \xt 1Pe 2:9.\x*
\v 6 \add So\add* you all will be my kingdom of priests and a nation \add dedicated to me\add*.” (That’s the message to pass on to the Israelis.)\x + \xo 19:6: \xt Rev 1:6; 5:10.\x*
\v 7 \add So\add* Mosheh descended \add again\add* and summoned the Israeli elders, then he passed on that message \add just\add* as Yahweh had commanded him,
\v 8 and all the people responded together, \add agreeing\add*, “We’ll do everything that Yahweh has said.” Then Mosheh took the people’s response back to Yahweh
\v 9 and Yahweh told \add him\add*, “Look, I’ll come to you in a thick cloud so that the people will be able to hear when I speak with you \add so they’ll also continue to\add* trust you.”
\p Then Mosheh told Yahweh the people’s words
\v 10 and Yahweh \add responded\add*, “Go \add down\add* to the people and purify them today and tomorrow. Have them wash their clothes
\v 11 and be prepared for the third day, because on the third day \add I\add* will come down to Mt. Sinai while all the people watch.
\v 12 Set boundaries for the people all around, and tell \add them\add*, ‘Don’t climb on the mountain or touch its edge, because anyone who does will definitely be executed.\x + \xo 19:12-13: \xt Heb 12:18-20.\x*
\v 13 Anyone \add who touches the mountain\add* mustn’t be touched by anyone else—they must be \add executed by throwing rocks at them\add* or shooting them \add with a bow\add*. No person or animal \add who touches the mountain\add* can stay alive.’ \add Only after a long trumpet blast\add* should they \add start to\add* climb the mountain.”
\v 14 \add So\add* Mosheh went down the mountain to the people. He purified them and they \add all\add* washed their clothes,
\v 15 and he told \add them\add*, “Abstain from sexual relations, and be ready by the third day.”
\p
\v 16 \add So\add* on the morning of the third day, there was thunder and lightning and a thick cloud on the mountain, and an extremely loud horn blast, and all the people in the camp were trembling.\x + \xo 19:16: \xt Rev 4:5.\x*
\v 17 Then Mosheh \add led\add* the people out of the camp to \add go and\add* meet God, and they stationed themselves at the \add foot\add* of the mountain.
\v 18 Yahweh descended onto Mount Sinai \add surrounded\add* by fire and the entire mountain smoked. Its smoke went up like the smoke from a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled violently.
\v 19 Then it happened \add after\add* the sound of the horn got extremely loud, that Mosheh was speaking and God was answering him in a voice.
\v 20 Yahweh had descended onto the top of Mt. Sinai, and \add he\add* called Mosheh up to the top of the mountain, \add so\add* Mosheh ascended.
\v 21 \add But\add* Yahweh told \add him\add*, “Go \add back\add* down and warn the people in case they force their way through to look at \add me\add* and many of them perish.
\v 22 Also, the priests who come nearer to \add me\add*, they \add must be very careful to purify themselves\add* in case \add I\add* \add suddenly punish\add* them.”
\v 23 \add But\add* Mosheh \add questioned\add* Yahweh, “The people aren’t able to come up on Mount Sinai, because you yourself warned us,\x + \xo 19:23 \xt 19:12.\x* ‘Set boundaries all around the mountain to keep it sacred.’ ”
\v 24 “Go \add back\add* down,” Yahweh \add responded\add*, “and bring Aharon back up with you. \add However,\add* the priests and the people \add must not cross the boundary\add* to come up to \add me\add*, in case \add I\add* \add suddenly punish\add* them.”
\v 25 \add So\add* Mosheh went down and spoke to the people.
\c 20
\s1 The ten rules
\r (Deu. 5:1-22)
\p
\v 1 Then God \add gave these instructions\add* \add to the Israelis\add*:
\v 2 I’m your god Yahweh, who \add rescued you\f + \fr 20:2 \ft Although modern English doesn’t easily distinguish it, this discourse is addressed to singular ‘you’, i.e., to the Israelis as one group. While some of our modern, individualistic cultures might naturally interpret these rules as applying to individuals, they were given to Yisrael/Israel to implement at a national level.\f* from where you were enslaved in\add* Egypt.
\li1
\v 3 You mustn’t own any other gods \add in my sight\add*.
\li1
\v 4 You mustn’t make a carved figure for yourself, nor \add carve a copy\add* of anything in the sky above or in the earth below, or that’s in the water under the earth.\x + \xo 20:4-5: \xt Exo 34:17; Lev 19:4; 26:1; Deu 4:15-18; 27:15.\x*
\v 5 Don’t bow down to \add idols\add* and don’t serve them, because I, your god Yahweh, am a jealous God. I remember the sins of the fathers and \add punish\add* the children of \add even\add* the third and fourth \add generation\add* of those who hate me,\x + \xo 20:5-6: \xt Exo 34:6-7; Num 14:18; Deu 7:9-10.\x*
\v 6 \add but\add* I \add faithfully fulfil my promises\add* to \em thousands\em* \add of generations\add* of those who love me and who obey my instructions.
\li1
\v 7 You mustn’t \add wrongly promote\add* the name of Yahweh your god, because \add I\add* won’t leave anyone unpunished who \add does that\add*.\x + \xo 20:7: \xt Lev 19:12.\x*
\li1
\v 8 \add Keep Saturday different from all the other days\add*\x + \xo 20:8: \xt Exo 16:23-30; 31:12-14.\x*—
\v 9 there’s six days \add every week\add* for working.\x + \xo 20:9-10: \xt Exo 23:12; 31:15; 34:21; 35:2; Lev 23:3.\x*
\v 10 The seventh day is a rest day for Yahweh your god: you mustn’t do any work—not you, or your children, or your male or female servants, or your cattle, or the foreigners \add living among you\add*—
\v 11 because Yahweh made the heavens and earth, the sea, and everything that’s in them in six days. Then he rested on the seventh day, so that’s why \add he\add* blessed the rest day and made it sacred.\x + \xo 20:11: \xt Gen 2:1-3; Exo 31:17.\x*
\li1
\v 12 Honour your father and your mother, so that \add you’ll have a long life\add* on the land that your god Yahweh is about to give you.\x + \xo 20:12: a \xt Deu 27:16; Mat 15:4; 19:19; Mrk 7:10; 10:19; Luk 18:20; Eph 6:2; \xo b \xt Eph 6:3.\x*
\li1
\v 13 You mustn’t murder.\x + \xo 20:13: \xt Gen 9:6; Lev 24:17; Mat 5:21; 19:18; Mrk 10:19; Luk 18:20; Rom 13:9; Jam 2:11.\x*
\li1
\v 14 You mustn’t commit adultery.\x + \xo 20:14: \xt Lev 20:10; Mat 5:27; 19:18; Mrk 10:19; Luk 18:20; Rom 13:9; Jam 2:11.\x*
\li1
\v 15 You mustn’t steal.\x + \xo 20:15: \xt Lev 19:11; Mat 19:18; Mrk 10:19; Luk 18:20; Rom 13:9.\x*
\li1
\v 16 You mustn’t \add lie in court\add*.\x + \xo 20:16: \xt Exo 23:1; Mat 19:18; Mrk 10:19; Luk 18:20.\x*
\li1
\v 17 You mustn’t covet your neighbour’s house or spouse, or their male or female servants, or their animals, or anything else they own.\x + \xo 20:17: \xt Rom 7:7; 13:9.\x*
\s1 The people are afraid of God
\r (Deu. 5:22-33)
\p
\v 18 All of the people could hear and see the thunder and the lightning, the sound of the horn, and the mountain smoking. They trembled \add when\add* \add they\add* saw it, and they \add remained\add* standing at a distance.\x + \xo 20:18-19: \xt Heb 12:18-19.\x*
\v 19 They \add begged\add* Mosheh, “You be the one to speak to us, and we’ll listen, but don’t let God speak \add directly\add* to us, in case we die.”
\p
\v 20 “Don’t be afraid,” Mosheh responded, “because God has come to test you so that the fear of him \add will remain with you\add* so that you all won’t \add disobey him\add*.”
\v 21 So the people stood \add at a good distance\add* \add while\add* Mosheh approached toward the thick darkness where God was.
\s1 Instructions about altars
\p
\v 22 Then Yahweh told Mosheh, “This is what you need to tell the Israelis: ‘You yourselves have seen that I, \add Yahweh,\add* have talked with you from heaven.
\v 23 You all mustn’t make gods out of silver or gold for yourselves to have alongside me.
\v 24 You need to make an altar for me out of dirt, and then you can sacrifice your burnt offerings and peace offerings, and your sheep and cattle, on it. \add I’ll inform you about every place where I want to be worshipped\add* and I’ll come to you and will bless you \add there\add*.
\v 25 If you do make me an altar with stones, you mustn’t use cut stones to build it because moving your tools over it will defile it.\x + \xo 20:25: \xt Deu 27:5-7; Josh 8:31.\x*
\v 26 And don’t use steps to get up to the altar because you might expose your \add private parts\add* \add under your robes\add*.
\c 21
\s1 Rules about slaves
\r (Deu. 15:12-18)
\p
\v 1 These are the rules that you must present to them:
\s2 Hebrew slaves
\v 2 If you buy a Hebrew slave, he should serve for six years, then in the seventh year he must be set free without having to pay you anything.\x + \xo 21:2-6: \xt Lev 25:39-46.\x*
\v 3 If he came by himself, he can go free by himself. If he’s married with a wife, then his wife must be set free with him.
\v 4 If his master gave him a wife and she bore him sons or daughters, then the wife and her children are her master’s, and only the husband must be set free.
\v 5 \add But\add* if \add he\add* plainly says, “I love my master, my wife, and my children so I \add voluntarily\add* choose not to be set free,”
\v 6 then his master must take him to \add the place of worship\add*. He must bring him to a door or to a doorpost, and his master must bore a hole his ear with an awl. Then he must serve him \add for life\add*.
\p
\v 7 And if a man sells his daughter as a female slave, she \add won’t be sent away\add* \add after six years\add* like the male slaves.
\v 8 If the man who bought her \add wanted her to become his slave-wife\add*, but \add later\add* \add he isn’t pleased with her behaviour\add*, he must allow her to be bought back by her \add relatives\add*. He has no authority to sell her on to outsiders, because that would \add break the understanding of proper treatment\add* of her.

\p
\v 9 Concerning every other squabble about any cattle or a donkey or sheep, or about clothing or any lost property that’s under dispute, both parties must go to \add the judges for God’s decision\add*—anyone who God declares to be guilty must pay his neighbour double as compensation.

\v 10 If anyone gives \add their\add* neighbour a donkey or a cow or a sheep or any animal to look after, and it dies or is injured or disappears without anyone seeing,

\v 21 \add Stay behind him\add* and listen to \add what he says\add*. Don’t \add annoy\add* him because he won’t \add put up with disobedience\add* because \add he represents my authority\add*.
\v 22 \add But\add* if you \add take careful notice of his words\add* and do everything that I say, then I’ll be an enemy to your enemies and I’ll be against those who are against you.
\v 23 My messenger will go \add ahead of you\add* and take you to \add face\add* the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivites, and the Yebusites, and then I’ll annihilate them.
\v 24 You mustn’t serve or bow down to their gods, and you mustn’t do \add what those people\add* do, because you must completely overthrow them and completely smash their \add sacred\add* stone pillars.
\v 25 You all must worship your god Yahweh, and he’ll bless your food and your water. I’ll keep sickness away from you
\v 26 \add and\add* there won’t be \add any miscarriages\add* or \add women\add* in your land that can’t conceive. I’ll ensure \add that you live your full\add* number of days.

\v 27 I’ll \add go ahead of you and will terrify\add* and confuse all of the people \add groups\add* \add whose lands you’ll enter\add*, and I’ll \add cause them to flee from you in battle\add*.
\v 28 I’ll send hornets \add ahead of you\add* and \add they’ll\add* drive out the Hivites, the Canaanites, and the Hittites \add before you get there\add*.

\v 30 I’ll drive them out little by little \add ahead of you\add* until \add your numbers increase\add* and you take over the land.

\v 32 You mustn’t make any agreement with \add those people\add* or with their gods.
\v 33 They mustn’t live in your land, in case they cause you to sin against me. Their gods would certainly become a trap for you, and then you’d \add end up\add* worshipping them.

\s1 The people confirm their agreement
\p
\v 1 Then \add Yahweh\add* told Mosheh, “Come up \add the mountain\add* to \add me\add*—you, Aharon, Nadab, Abihu and seventy of the Israeli elders, and you must \add stay\add* at a distance to worship.
\v 2 Then Mosheh alone must approach \add me\add*, \add but\add* \add the others\add* mustn’t come near, and \add also\add* the people mustn’t come up with him.”
\p
\v 3 \add So\add* Mosheh went and explained to the people \add everything that Yahweh had said, including\add* all the regulations. Then all of the people answered \add in unison\add*, “We’ll do everything that Yahweh has \add told us to do\add*.”
\v 4 \add So\add* Mosheh wrote \add down everything that Yahweh had instructed\add*. Then he got up early in the morning and built an altar at the bottom of the mountain and \add set up\add* twelve stone pillars for the twelve tribes of Yisrael,
\v 5 and he sent some young men to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice some bulls as peace offerings to Yahweh.
\v 6 Mosheh took half of the blood \add from the sacrifices\add* and put it into basins. He sprinkled \add the other\add* half of the blood onto the altar.
\v 7 Then he took the scroll with the agreement \add written on it\add* and read it out loud to the people, and they \add responded\add*, “We’ll obey everything that Yahweh has instructed.”
\p
\v 8 Then Mosheh took the blood \add in the bowls\add* and sprinkled it onto the people, telling \add them\add*, “Look. \add This is\add* the blood \add confirming\add* the agreement that Yahweh has made with you according to \add what you just heard\add*.”\x + \xo 24:8: a \xt Mat 26:28; Mrk 14:24; Luk 22:20; 1Cor 11:25; Heb 10:29; \xo b \xt Heb 9:19-20.\x*

\v 10 and they saw the god of Yisrael. Under his feet was something like a tile made of sapphire that \add looked so pure that it was as clear\add* as the sky.
\v 11 Those Israeli leaders saw God and \add yet they weren’t harmed by him.\add*. Then they ate and drank \add together\add*.
\s1 Mosheh’s long stay on Mt. Sinai

\v 12 Then Yahweh told Mosheh, “Come up to me on the mountain and \add wait\add* there, and I will give you some stone slabs with the rules and regulations that I have written \add on them so you can\add* to teach them \add to the people\add*.”
\v 13 \add So\add* Mosheh and his assistant Yehoshua set off, and Mosheh climbed up God’s mountain.
\v 14 He had \add already\add* told the elders, “Wait for us \add down here\add* in this place until we return \add here\add* to you all. And see, Aharon and Hur are with you—\add any leader judging matters requiring more wisdom can approach\add* them \add for help\add*.”
\p
\v 15 Then Mosheh went to \add the base of\add* the mountain and a cloud covered \add over\add* \add it\add*.
\v 16 Yahweh’s \add radiance\add* settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days, then on the seventh day he called to Mosheh from within the cloud.
\v 17 The appearance of Yahweh’s \add radiance\add* was like a \add roaring\add* fire on the top of the mountain \add from what the Israelis below could see\add*.
\v 18 Then Mosheh entered \add into\add* the cloud and continued up the mountain, and \add he\add* remained up there for forty full days.\x + \xo 24:18: \xt Deu 9:9.\x*

\v 1 You must make \add my\add* residence with ten fabric panels formed by a skilled craftsman. They must be made from twisted finely-spun linen, with winged-creatures \add embroidered on them using\add* blue, purple, and scarlet thread.
\v 2 The hanging panels must all be the same size: 14.5m long and two metres wide.
\v 3 Five of the panels will be coupled together \add as one set\add* and the other five as another.
\v 4 For each set, make loops of blue cloth and fasten them along the outer edge of each of the end panels—
\v 5 place fifty loops on the end of each set so that the loops are opposite each other.
\v 6 You’ll also need to make fifty gold clips to join the two sets together to make a single walled structure.
\p
\v 7 You must make eleven panels with goats’ hair to form a tent over the residence.
\v 8 Each of the eleven panels must be the same size: 15m long and two metres wide.
\v 9 You must join five panels into a set, and six panels into the other set so that the sixth panel can be doubled over at the front of the tent.
\v 10 You must make 50 loops to go onto the end of one set, and another 50 for the edge of the other set.
\v 11 You’ll also need to make fifty bronze clips to join the two sets together to make the tent cover.
\v 12 Let the extra half panel hang over the back of the residence.
\v 13 The half metre of extra length on each side that extends beyond the linen sets will hang \add evenly\add* over the sides.
\p
\v 14 You must make a covering of rams hides dyed red to go over the tent, then another covering sea-cow hides to go over that.
\s2 The wooden frames
\p
\v 15 You must make frames for \add my\add* residence from acacia wood. They’ll stand upright
\v 16 \add and\add* each one must be five metres high and 0.75m wide.
\v 17 Each frame must have two protrusions so it can be connected to the frame next to it.
\v 18 Assemble twenty frames for the south side of the residence
\v 19 along with forty silver bases to go underneath them—two bases supporting each frame, and each frame having two protrusions at the bottom to go into the bases.
\v 20 For the north side, assemble twenty frames
\v 21 along with forty silver bases—two under each frame.
\v 22 For the rear of the residence facing west, assemble six frames
\v 23 plus two extra frames for \add bracing\add* the two back corners—
\v 24 they must be joined \add on\add* at the bottom and then both of them have their tops attached to a ring.
\v 25 Then assemble eight frames with their sixteen silver bases—two bases supporting each frame.
\p
\v 26 Make crossbars from acacia wood—five of them to go across the frames on the northern side,
\v 27 five for the south side, and five for the frames at the rear of the residence on the western side.
\v 28 The middle crossbar in the centre of the frames will go right through from one end to the other.
\v 29 Overlay the frames and the crossbars with gold, and make the rings for holding the crossbars with gold.
\v 30 Then you must assemble \add my\add* residence exactly as per the plan that you were shown on the mountain.
\s2 The curtain
\p
\v 31 You must have a skillful workman make a curtain from twisted finely-spun linen, with winged-creatures \add embroidered on them using\add* blue, purple, and scarlet thread.
\v 32 Hang it from gold clips on four pillars made from acacia wood overlaid with gold on four silver bases.
\v 33 Hang the curtain under the clips, then bring the box that contains the agreement inside the curtain. That curtain will separate for you between the sacred section and the \em very\em* sacred interior.\x + \xo 26:33: \xt Heb 6:19; 9:3-5.\x*
\v 34 Install the atonement platform as the lid on the box there in the very sacred interior.
\v 35 Set the table up outside the curtain on the north side, with the lampstand on the south side opposite the table.
\p
\v 36 Then make a curtain out of twisted finely-spun linen for the entrance of the tent. It should be embroidered with blue, purple and scarlet yarn.
\v 37 Make five pillars for the curtain from acacia wood overlaid with gold. The hooks on them must be made of gold, and their five bases must be cast with bronze.
\c 27
\s1 The altar for burnt offerings
\r (Exo. 38:1-7)
\p
\v 1 Make an altar from acacia wood that’s 2.5m square and 1.5m high
\v 2 and as part of that same piece of wood, include \add a carved projection like\add* a horn on each of the top corners of the altar. Overlay \add the altar\add* with bronze.
\v 3 Make pots for the ashes out of bronze, along with the necessary shovels, sprinkling bowls, meat forks, and fire-trays.
\v 4 Then make a bronze grating for it with four rings of bronze on the four corners.
\v 5 Fit it down onto a ledge inside the altar so that it sits inside the altar about halfway up.
\v 6 \add Also,\add* make poles from acacia wood for the altar and overlay them with bronze.
\v 7 They’ll be able to be put into rings on two sides of the altar for carrying it.
\v 8 The altar should be hollow in the middle and made from \add wooden\add* planks just like you were shown on the mountain.
\s1 The courtyard around the sacred tent
\r (Exo. 38:9-20)
\p
\v 9 Make curtains of twisted finely-spun linen \add to form\add* a courtyard \add around\add* the residence. The south side will require fifty metres of curtain
\v 10 with twenty \add bronze\add* pillars and their twenty bases. The hooks on the pillars and the clips must be made of silver.
\v 11 Similarly on the north side, \add another\add* fifty metres of curtain with twenty pillars and their bases and their hooks and clips.
\v 12 The west side will require twenty-five metres of curtain with ten pillars and bases.
\v 13 The east side of the courtyard must also be twenty-five metres wide.
\v 14 Only side side of the gate, the curtain will be 7.5m long with three pillars and bases,
\v 15 and the same on the other side.
\v 16 The entrance curtain must be made of twisted finely-spun linen. It’ll be ten metres wide and hang on four pillars with their bases, and must be embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.
\v 17 All the pillars for the courtyard must have silver decorations around them, as well as their silver hooks and bronze bases.
\v 18 \add So\add* the courtyard will be fifty metres by twenty-five metres and the curtain enclosure will be 2.5m high. All the curtains will be made of finely-spun linen, and the bases under all the pillars will be bronze.
\v 19 All the equipment for the operation of the residence and all the tent pegs and pegs for the courtyard must be made of bronze.
\s1 The oil for the lamps
\r (Lev. 24:1-4)
\p
\v 20 Order the Israelis to bring you pure, pressed olive oil for the lamps so they can be kept burning continually.
\v 21 In the outer portion of the sacred tent (outside the curtain where the sacred box is kept), Aharon and his sons must attend to the lampstand in front of Yahweh from evening to morning. This regulation will apply continually to all future generations of Israelis.
\c 28
\s1 The priests’ uniform
\r (Exo. 39:1-7)
\p
\v 1 \add Now,\add* have your brother Aharon and his sons brought to you from among the Israelis. Aharon, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar will become my priests.
\v 2 Make sacred clothes for Aharon—they must be \add uniquely\add* beautiful
\v 3 \add so\add* speak to all the \add skilled craftsmen who’ve been given\add* the spirit of wisdom, and they can make Aharon’s clothes to \add dedicate him as\add* my priest.
\v 4 These are the clothes that they’ll need to make: a small pouch to hang around the neck and an apron, a robe and a tunic of woven work, and a turban and a waistband. They must make \add those\add* sacred clothes for your brother Aharon and for his sons to serve as my priests.
\v 5 \add The skilled craftsmen\add* must \add be given\add* gold \add wire\add* and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and finely-spun linen.
\p
\v 6 They must make the sacred apron from twisted finely-spun linen with gold \add wire\add* and blue, purple, scarlet yarn embroidered onto it by a skilled craftsman.
\v 7 It should have two shoulder pieces attached to \add the top\add* two corners so it can be fastened.
\v 8 Then the waistband for the apron shall be made with similar workmanship from twisted finely-spun linen with gold \add wire\add* and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn skillfully embroidered into it.
\v 9 Then get two onyx stones and engrave the names of Yisra’el’s \add twelve\add* sons onto them—
\v 10 six names on one stone and six on the other, in their birth order.
\v 11 A stone craftsman with experience at making signet rings should do the engravings, and then mount the two stones in decorative gold settings.
\v 12 Then attach the two stones to the shoulder pieces of the apron as a reminder about Yisra’el’s sons. That way Aharon will carry their names on his two shoulders as a reminder \add every time\add* he goes to face Yahweh.
\v 13 Make the decorative settings for the \add two\add* stones from gold,
\v 14 and then make two twisted chains of pure gold like a cord that you can attach to the decorative settings.
\s1 The chestpiece
\r (Exo. 39:8-21)
\p
\v 15 Make a \bd sacred chest pouch\bd* for \add important decision making\add*. A skilled craftsman should make it from twisted finely-spun linen like the apron, embroidered with gold \add wire\add* and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.
\v 16 It needs to be 23cm square when folded over double,
\v 17 and it will have four rows of \add three\add* gemstones on it: a \add red\add* ruby, a \add yellow\add* topaz, a \add green\add* emerald,
\v 18 then a turquoise, a \add blue\add* sapphire, a diamond,
\v 19 then a \add red\add* jacinth, a \add white\add* agate, a \add purple\add* amethyst,
\v 20 and in the last row, a \add yellow\add* beryl, an onyx, and a \add green\add* jasper. All those stones must be mounted in decorative gold settings,
\v 21 and \add so\add* they’ll represent the twelve tribes of Yisrael. The names of the twelve sons must be engraved on the stones similar to how signet rings \add are made\add*.
\v 22 Make two twisted chains of pure gold like a cord that you can attach to the pouch,
\v 23 then make two gold rings and attach them to the two \add top\add* corners of the pouch.
\v 24 Attach the two gold chains to the rings on the corners
\v 25 with the other ends fastened to the two decorative settings \add around the stones\add* and then attached to the front side of the shoulder straps.
\v 26 Make two more gold rings and attach them on the inside to the two \add bottom\add* corners of the pouch,
\v 27 and another two gold rings to be attached to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces near where the shoulder straps join the apron just above the crafted waistband.
\v 28 Then tie the rings on the sacred pouch to the rings on the apron with a blue cord so that the pouch sits above the waistband and can’t come loose from the apron.
\p
\v 29 Then \add whenever\add* Aharon enters the sacred inner room \add to stand\add* in front of \add me\add*, he’ll be carrying the names of Yisra’el’s sons over his heart on the sacred pouch that’ll be used for making decisions.
\v 30 Then place the ‘Urim’ and the ‘Tummim’\f + \fr 28:30 \ft These two objects appear abruptly in the text—they haven’t been described previously—in fact, they’re not described anywhere, so we don’t really know much about them except that it seems they were used somehow to indicate Yahweh’s decision on important matters. Although we presume that Mosheh must have already been familiar with them, sadly we’re unable to translate these two Hebrew words, because we’re not.\f* in the sacred pouch so they’ll be over Aharon’s heart when he goes in before Yahweh, thus Aharon will continually bear the decisions of the Israelis over his heart before Yahweh.\x + \xo 28:30: \xt Num 27:21; Deu 33:8; Ezr 2:63; Neh 7:65.\x*
\s1 The other parts of the uniform
\r (Exo. 39:22-31)
\p
\v 31 Make the \bd robe\bd* \add to be worn under\add* the sacred apron entirely from blue material
\v 32 with an opening for his head in the middle of it. A border will be needed around the opening so it can’t tear—this should be woven like openings in regular clothes.
\v 33 Then on the bottom hem, make \add decorations that look like\add* pomegranates—they must be made from blue, purple, and scarlet yarn. Gold bells should hang in between the pomegranates
\v 34 so as you go around the hem of the robe there’ll be a gold bell, then a pomegranate, then a gold bell, then a pomegranate, etc.
\v 35 Aharon must wear this robe when he’s serving, so when he goes into \add my\add* presence in the sacred inner room, I’ll hear the bells when he enters and when he leaves, so he won’t die.
\p
\v 36 Make a \add plate\add* from pure gold and engrave ‘Dedicated to Yahweh’ on it like you would on a signet ring.
\v 37 Attach it to the front of the turban using a blue cord
\v 38 \add so\add* it’ll be on Aharon’s forehead. \add In this way,\add* it’ll bear the \add deficiencies of human\add* sinfulness when Israelis \add attempt\add* to make sacred objects and \add attempt\add* to make sacred offerings. Thus it’ll be on his forehead continually so that \add I\add* will \add see it and\add* accept those things.
\p
\v 39 The \bd tunic\bd* must be woven from finely-spun linen, and similarly for the \bd turban\bd*. An embroiderer must make the \bd waistband\bd*.
\p
\v 40 You must \add also\add* make tunics, waistbands and headbands for Aharon’s sons so they’ll \add look\add* splendid and beautiful.
\v 41 Put these clothes on your brother Aharon and his sons, then anoint them \add with oil\add* and ordain and consecrate them as priests to me.
\v 42 Make \bd underwear\bd* out of linen to cover their bare flesh from the waist to the thighs—
\v 43 they must wear it whenever they enter the sacred tent and whenever they approach the altar to offer sacrifices so they won’t be disobeying and die. Aharon and his descendants must obey that rule forever.
\c 29
\s1 Consecrating the priests
\r (Lev. 8:1-36)
\p
\v 1 Now this is how you should consecrate them to be priests to me: Take a young bull from the herd and two rams without defects.
\v 2 \add Also,\add* using finely-ground wheat flour, \add bake\add* flat bread, flat cakes with \add olive\add* oil in them, and flat wafers sprinkled with \add olive\add* oil.
\v 3 Put \add the baking\add* into a basket, and bring the basket \add to me\add* along with the bull and two rams.
\p
\v 4 Then take Aharon and his sons near to the entrance of the sacred tent and wash them with water.
\v 5 Take the clothes and dress Aharon in the tunic and the robe that goes with the apron, then the sacred apron and the sacred pouch, and tie the waistband around the apron.
\v 6 Put the turban on his head and attach the sacred \add gold\add* ornament to it,
\v 7 then take the anointing oil and pour it over his head to dedicate him.
\v 8 \add Next,\add* bring his sons and put tunics on them
\v 9 and wrap waistbands around them and tie on their headbands. They \add and their descendants\add* will be priests forever, and you must ordain \add both\add* Aharon and his sons.
\p
\v 10 Then bring the bull to the front of the sacred tent and get Aharon and his sons to put their hands on its head,
\v 11 then slaughter\f + \fr 29:11 \ft The throat will be cut with a sharp knife, and the blood will be caught in a bowl.\f* the bull before \add me\add* at the entrance of the sacred tent.
\v 12 Take some of that blood and smear it on the top projections of the altar with your finger, then pour the rest of it \add on the ground\add* at the base of the altar.
\v 13 Take all the fat covering the innards including the lobe above the liver, as well as both kidneys and the fat on them, and burn it all on the altar,
\v 14 but the bull’s meat and hide and intestines must be burnt outside the camp. Sacrificing \add the bull’s fat like that\add* is an act of purification.
\p
\v 15 Then take one of the rams and have Aharon and his sons place their hands on \add its\add* head,
\v 16 then slaughter it. \add Catch\add* the blood and sprinkle it all over \add the sides of\add* the altar.
\v 17 Then cut the ram into pieces and wash its innards and its legs, and put \add those bits\add* \add together\add* with the head and the \add other\add* pieces.
\v 18 Then burn \add it\add* all on the altar. That will be a burnt offering to \add me\add*—a pleasing aroma \add from\add* the offering by fire.\x + \xo 29:18: \xt Eph 5:2; Php 4:18.\x*
\p
\v 19 Then take the second ram, and have Aharon and his sons place their hands on \add its\add* head,
\v 20 then slaughter it. \add Catch\add* the blood and smear some of it on the tip of Aharon and his sons’ right ears and on their right thumbs and big toes. Then sprinkle the rest all over \add the sides of\add* the altar.
\v 21 Take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle that on Aharon and his clothes, and on his sons and their clothes. That will consecrate Aharon and his sons and their \add priestly\add* clothes.
\p
\v 22 Take the fat of \add that second\add* ram, and its fat tail, the fat covering its innards and the lobe above the liver, the two kidneys and that fat that’s on them, and the right thigh, \add because\add* this ram is for consecration.
\v 23 \add Also\add* take one \add round\add* bread loaf, one cake of bread made with oil in it, and one wafer from that basket of flat breads that’s \add offered to\add* \add me\add*.
\v 24 Put all those into the hands of Aharon and his sons, and \add they\add* must wave them before \add me\add* as a wave offering.
\v 25 Then take them from their hands and burn them completely on the altar on top of the burnt offering. That also will be a fire offering to \add me\add*, and its aroma will please \add me\add*.
\p
\v 26 Take the breast meat of the ram (\add the second one\add* for the consecration of Aharon) and wave it as a wave offering before \add me\add*. Then after that it will be your share \add to cook and eat\add*.
\p
\v 27 \add So\add* you should consecrate the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the contribution from the ram of consecration for Aharon and his sons.
\v 28 Those will belong to Aharon and his sons as their regular portion from the Israelis—it will be a contribution from the Israelis from their peace offerings to \add me\add*.
\p
\v 29 The sacred clothes that belong to Aharon will be used for his male descendants to wear \add in turn\add* when they’re anointed and consecrated.
\v 30 The priest who succeeds him from among his sons, who comes into the sacred tent to serve in the sacred inner room must wear them for seven days.
\p
\v 31 Take the ram of consecration and boil its meat in a sacred place,
\v 32 then Aharon and his sons should eat the meat of the ram as well as the breads that are in the basket at the entrance to the tent.
\v 33 They must eat those things used to make atonement for them and to consecrate them. No one else can eat them, because they’ve been made sacred.
\v 34 If any meat of the consecration or any of the bread remains until the morning, then you must burn the remainder—it can’t be eaten because it’s been made sacred.
\p
\v 35 \add So\add* that’s what you must do for Aharon and his sons, just like I’ve commanded you. You’ll consecrate them for seven days,
\v 36 and each day you must sacrifice a bull to purify the altar and compensate for the altar’s imperfections. You must also anoint it \add each day with olive oil\add* to make it sacred.
\v 37 After making atonement for the altar and making it sacred for seven days, it will then be so sacred that anything that touches it will also become sacred.
\s1 The daily sacrifices
\r (Num. 28:1-8)
\p
\v 38 \add After all that,\add* you must continually offer two, year-old lambs every day—
\v 39 one in the morning and the other around twilight.
\v 40 With the \add morning\add* lamb, \add also\add* offer 2kg of finely-ground wheat flour mixed with a litre of pressed olive oil and a litre of wine.
\v 41 With the twilight lamb, offer the same grain offering as in the morning, and the same drink offering. That will be a fire offering to \add me\add* and the aroma will please me.
\v 42 This must be a continual offering to \add me\add* at the entrance of the sacred tent \add even\add* in following generations, and I’ll meet with you all there to speak to you there
\v 43 and I’ll meet with the Israelis there, and my splendour will sanctify it.
\v 44 I’ll consecrate the sacred tent and the altar, and I’ll sanctify Aharon and his sons to be my priests.
\v 45 Then I’ll live \add there\add* among the Israelis and I will be their god,
\v 46 and they will know that I’m their god Yahweh, who brought them out of Egypt so I could live among them. I am Yahweh their god.
\c 30
\s1 The incense altar
\r (Exo. 37:25-28)
\p
\v 1 You must make an altar out of acacia word for burning incense on.
\v 2 It should be square—half a metre on each side—and a metre high. Make projections that look like horns on top out of that same block of wood.
\v 3 It must be overlaid with pure gold—its top and all around its sides and its projections—plus you shall make a gold moulding all around it.
\v 4 Make two gold rings and attach them to the altar below the moulding—one on each side to hold the poles for carrying it with.
\v 5 Make the two poles from acacia wood and overlay them with gold.
\v 6 Put this incense altar outside the curtain that hangs in front of the sacred chest—the box containing the stone slabs and with a platform on it where I will meet with you.
\p
\v 7 Aharon must burn fragrant incense on this altar every morning when he looks after the lamps
\v 8 and again every evening when he \add lights\add* the lamps, \add so\add* incense must be continually burning before \add me\add* throughout your generations.
\v 9 Don’t offer up any incense or burnt offering or grain offering on it that’s different from these instructions, and don’t pour a drink offering on it.
\v 10 Once a year, Aharon must take the purifying blood from the annual atonement sacrifice and put it on the projections of the altar to compensate for the altar’s imperfection. Each high priest will cover the altar’s flaws this way throughout all future generations. \add The altar\add* will be very sacred—dedicated to \add me\add*.
\s1 The tax for making the tent
\p
\v 11 Then Yahweh told Mosheh:
\v 12 Whenever you \add take a census of the Israeli men\add*, each man must pay a ransom to Yahweh for his life when they’re counted, and then the counting won’t cause a plague among them.
\v 13 As each man crosses over to stand with those who’ve been counted, he must pay give a half-shekel coin as an offering to \add me\add*. (That’s half of the official shekel weight of 12 grams.)\x + \xo 30:13: \xt Exo 38:25-26; Mat 17:24.\x*
\v 14 Every man who’s twenty or older must pay this contribution to \add me\add* when he’s counted—
\v 15 the wealthy aren’t expected to pay more, and the poor must not pass less than this amount when they pay this ransom to \add me\add* to make atonement for your lives.
\v 16 Then you must take that money from the Israelis and use it for work on the sacred tent—it will be a reminder to \add me\add* that you all have made atonement for your lives.
\s1 The washbasin
\p
\v 17 The Yahweh told Mosheh:
\v 18 Make a bronze washbasin with a bronze base. Place it between the sacred tent and the altar, and fill it with water\x + \xo 30:18: \xt Exo 38:8.\x*
\v 19 and Aharon and his sons must wash their hands and feet in it.
\v 20 Before they go into the sacred tent, they must wash with water so that won’t die, and \add also\add* when they’re going to the altar to burn offerings to \add me\add*—
\v 21 they must wash their hands and feet so they won’t die. This will be a rule for them and for all their descendants throughout the generations.
\s1 The anointing oil
\p
\v 22 Then Yahweh told Mosheh:\x + \xo 30:22-38: \xt Exo 37:29.\x*
\v 23 Then you yourself must collect these spices: 6kg of \add fragrant sap\add* named myrrh, then 3kg of fragrant cinnamon, 3kg of fragrant cane,
\v 24 and 6kg of fragrant casia bark. (Use the official weight for everything.) Also, four litres of olive oil.
\v 25 Get a professional perfumer to make this into a sacred, fragrant, anointing oil.
\v 26 Use it to anoint the sacred tent and the box containing the stone slabs,
\v 27 as well as the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and its utensils, the incense altar,
\v 28 the altar for burnt offerings and all its equipment, and the basin and its base.
\v 29 That will make them sacred and dedicated to me, and anything that touches them will also become sacred.
\p
\v 30 Then anoint Aharon and his sons, and dedicate them to become my priests.
\v 31 Approach the Israelis and tell them, “This \add recipe\add* will be my sacred anointing oil for all generations.
\v 32 It must not be poured on anyone’s body, and you all must not use any similar recipe \add for yourselves\add*—it’s sacred and \add must be treated as such\add*.
\v 33 Anyone who mixes together anything like that, or who puts any of it on a stranger, must be \add expelled from the community\add*.
\s1 The incense
\p
\v 34 Then Yahweh told Mosheh: Collect equal amounts of stacte, onycha, and galbanum spices, and pure frankincense,
\v 35 and get a professional ointment mixer to add salt and make it into pure incense that will be sacred.
\v 36 Pulverise some of it into a fine powder and put it in front of the box containing the stone slabs inside the sacred tent. This incense must be regarded as being very sacred.
\v 37 No one else should make any incense for yourselves with this same recipe—it must be regarded as sacred to \add me\add*.
\v 38 Anyone who makes anything similar for its fragrance must be \add expelled from the community\add*.
\c 31
\s1 Bezalel and Oholiab
\r (Exo. 35:30–36:1)
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh told Mosheh:
\v 2 Listen, I’ve chosen a man named Bezalel (son of Uri, son of Hur, from Yehudah’s descendants)
\v 3 and I’ve filled him with \add my\add* spirit with wisdom, ability, knowledge, and general craftsmanship.
\v 4 \add He’s capable of\add* designing and creating gold, silver, and bronze works,
\v 5 as well as cutting and setting gemstones, wood-carving, and other crafts.
\v 6 And what’s more, I’ve appointed Oholiab (son of Ahisamak, from Dan’s descendants) to help him, and I’ve \add also\add* given special ability to other skilled \add men\add* so that they can make everything that I’ve instructed you:
\li1
\v 7 the sacred tent,
\li1 the box containing the stone slabs with the atonement platform on top of it,
\li1 all the equipment for inside the sacred tent,
\li1
\v 8 the table and its utensils,
\li1 the gold lampstand and all its utensils,
\li1 the altar for \add burning\add* incense,
\li1
\v 9 the altar for the burnt offerings and all its utensils,
\li1 the washbasin with its base,
\li1
\v 10 the woven clothes: the sacred clothes for Aharon the priest and his sons,
\li1
\v 11 the anointing oil, and
\li1 the fragrant incense for the sacred tent.
\m \add Those craftsmen\add* must make everything \add exactly\add* according to my instructions.
\s1 The rest day
\p
\v 12 Then Yahweh told Mosheh:
\v 13 Tell the Israelis that you all must certainly observe the \add weekly\add* rest day because \add the rest day\add* is a sign between me and you all throughout your generations, so that you will know that I am Yahweh, who \add wants to distinguish you from other nations\add*.
\v 14 \add So\add* you all must observe the rest day because it’s sacred for you. Anyone who \add treats it as an ordinary day\add* must be put to death. Anyone who works on it must be \add expelled from the community\add*.
\v 15 There’s six days for working, and then the seventh is a rest day—\add dedicated\add* to \add me\add*. Anyone who works on it must certainly be put to death.\x + \xo 31:15: \xt Exo 20:8-11; 23:12; 34:21; 35:2; Lev 23:3; Deu 5:12-14.\x*
\v 16 The Israelis must observe the rest day for all future generations. There’s no ending to this agreement
\v 17 between me and the Israelis. It’s a never-ending sign that \add I\add* made the heavens and the earth in six days, and then rested on the seventh day and was refreshed.\x + \xo 31:17: \xt Exo 20:11.\x*
\p
\v 18 When \add Yahweh\add* finished speaking to \add Mosheh\add*, he gave Mosheh the two stone slabs with the transcript that he had engraved on them with his own finger.

\s1 The gold bull idol
\r (Deu. 9:6-29)
\p
\v 1 \add Meanwhile,\add* the people had noticed that Mosheh \add had been up on the mountain for a long time\add*, \add so\add* \add they\add* gathered themselves around Aharon and told him, “Come on. Make \add some\add* gods for us that can go ahead of us, because we don’t know what’s happened to that Mosheh—the man\f + \fr 32:1 \ft The way that the people speak of Mosheh here suggests that maybe they never really ever regarded him as being one of them—remember, he did grow up in an Egyptian palace.\f* who brought us out of Egypt.”\x + \xo 32:1: \xt Acts 7:40.\x*
\p
\v 2 Aharon \add replied\add*, “Go and get the gold earrings off your wives and your sons and daughters, and bring them to me.”
\v 3 \add So\add* the people took off all their gold earrings and brought them to Aharon,
\v 4 and he took them and smelted and crafted the gold into the form of a young bull. Then \add the people\add* said, “These are your gods,\f + \fr 32:4 \ft After crafting the gold into the form of a young bull (which wasn’t necessarily solid but may have had an internal wooden frame or a clay centre), it’s not clear here why the text refers to plural ‘gods’.\f* Yisrael, who brought you out of Egypt.”\x + \xo 32:4: \xt 1Ki 12:28; Acts 7:41.\x*
\p
\v 5 \add When\add* Aharon saw \add that\add*, he built an altar in front of the bull and announced, “Tomorrow will be a festival to \add honour\add* Yahweh.”
\v 6 \add So\add* they got up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. Then the people sat down to eat and drink, then stood up to \add make merry\add*.\x + \xo 32:6: \xt 1Cor 10:7.\x*
\p
\v 7 Then Yahweh \add told\add* Mosheh, “Go on down because your people that you brought out of Egypt have gone bad—
\v 8 they’ve quickly deviated from what I instructed them. They’ve made a metal bull for themselves and have bowed down to it and sacrificed to it and they’ve said, ‘Yisrael, these are your gods that brought you out of Egypt.’ ”
\v 9 Then Yahweh said to Mosheh, “I’ve seen this people, and look, \add they’re so stubborn\add*.
\v 10 \add So\add* leave me alone now and let my anger rage against them. I will destroy them and make you into a great nation.”
\v 11 But Mosheh pleaded with his god Yahweh and \add asked\add*, “Yahweh, why \add are you angry at\add* your people that you have brought out of Egypt with \add your incredible power and actions\add*?\x + \xo 32:11-14: \xt Num 14:13-19.\x*
\v 12 \add If you did that,\add* the Egyptians would say, ‘\add Ha,\add* he brought them out with evil plans to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from \add off the earth\add*.’ Turn from your anger and repent from \add any idea of doing\add* evil to your people.
\v 13 Remember Abraham and Yitshak and Yisra’el—your servants that you swore to them yourself and told them, ‘I will cause your descendants to increase like the stars in the sky, and I will give your descendants all this land which I told you about, and they will inherit it forever.’ ”\x + \xo 32:13: \xt Gen 22:16-17; Gen 17:8.\x*
\v 14 \add So\add* Yahweh repented from the evil that he’d said he’d do to his people.
\p
\v 15 Then Mosheh turned and went down the mountain carrying the two tablets with the transcript. The tablets were engraved on both sides—front and back.
\v 16 \add They\add* were God’s work—it was \add his\add* writing and he had inscribed it on the tablets.
\v 17 \add As they descended,\add* Yehoshua heard the sounds of people shouting and said to Mosheh, “\add It sounds like a war going on down there\add* in the camp!”
\v 18 \add But\add* \add Mosheh\add* \add responded\add*, “It’s not a victory march, and it’s not \add moans of defeat\add*—it’s singing that I can hear!”
\v 19 Then as \add they\add* approached the camp, \add they\add* saw the bull and the dancing, and Mosheh \add got very angry\add* and threw the tablets \add down at the bottom of the mountain and they shattered\add*.
\v 20 He took the bull they had made and burnt it in the fire, then he ground it \add down\add* until it was powder and sprinkled it on top of \add pots of\add* water and made the Israelis drink it.
\p
\v 21 Then Mosheh \add demanded from\add* Aharon, “What did \add these\add* people do to you to make you bring such a terrible sin on them?”
\v 22 Aharon \add responded\add*, “Don’t \add be angry with me\add*, my master. You know the people—\add they’re intent on\add* evil.
\v 23 They \add insisted, saying\add*, ‘Make a god for us \add to lead us\add*. As for that Mosheh—the man that brought us out of Egypt—we don’t know what’s happened to him.’
\v 24 \add So\add* I \add told\add* them, ‘Anyone who has gold \add jewellery\add*, take it off yourself,’ and they gave it to me and I threw it into the fire, and this bull came out.”
\p
\v 25 Mosheh saw that the people \add were out of control\add* because Aharon had let \add them go wild\add*, \add and now they were subject\add* to mockery \add from any group that stood up\add* against them.
\v 26 Then Mosheh stood at the camp entrance and \add asked\add*, “Anyone who’s for Yahweh, \add come\add* to me.” And all the \add men from the\add* clan of Levi gathered around him.
\v 27 Then he \add told\add* them, “This is what Yahweh, the god of Yisrael, says: ‘Each man \add must strap\add* his sword on his side. Pass through and return from gate to gate in the camp and kill \add the unfaithful men—even if it’s your\add* brother, or friend, or neighbour.’ ”
\v 28 The Levite men did what Mosheh ordered and they killed about three thousand Israeli men that day.
\v 29 Then Mosheh \add told\add* \add them\add*, “\add Consecrate yourselves to\add* Yahweh today, because any man who \add stood\add* against his son or his brother today \add has\add* placed a blessing on \add himself\add*.”
\p
\v 30 The next day, Mosheh \add told\add* the people, “You all have committed a terrible sin, \add but\add* now I will go up to Yahweh—perhaps I can atone for your sin.”
\v 31 \add So\add* Mosheh returned to Yahweh and said, “Please, \add these people have\add* committed a terrible sin and made gods for themselves out of gold.
\v 32 \add But\add* now, \add maybe you’ll\add* forgive their sin, but if not, please blot me out of your book that you’ve written.”\x + \xo 32:32: \xt Psa 69:28; Rev 3:5.\x*
\v 33 \add But\add* Yahweh said to Mosheh, “It’s anyone who sinned against me that I’ll blot out of my book.
\v 34 \add So\add* go now \add and\add* lead the people to where I’ve spoken to you. See, my angel will go \add ahead of you, but\add* on the day \add that I settle accounts\add*, then I’ll punish them for their sin.”
\p
\v 35 Then Yahweh sent a plague on the people because they had got Aharon to make the \add gold\add* bull.
\c 33
\s1 God tells them to leave Mt. Sinai
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add told\add* Mosheh, “Go \add and\add* pack up from here, you and the people that you brought out of Egypt. Go to the land which I promised to Abraham, to Yitshak, and to Yacob, \add when I told them that\add* I’d give it to \add their descendants\add*.\x + \xo 33:1: a \xt Gen 12:7; \xo b \xt Gen 26:3; \xo c \xt Gen 28:13.\x*
\v 2 I’ll send an angel \add ahead of you\add*, and I’ll drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Yebusites.
\v 3 \add It’s\add* a land flowing with milk and honey, but I won’t \add stay among you\add* in case I \add decide to\add* destroy you on the way because you’re \add stubborn\add* people.”\x + \xo 33:3 \xt 32:9.\x*
\p
\v 4 \add When\add* the people heard this \add angry comment\add*, they mourned and none of them put on \add anything fancy\add*.\f + \fr 33:4 \ft But they didn’t mourn enough to wear sackcloth and throw ashes on themselves.\f*
\v 5 Yahweh \add had\add*\f + \fr 33:5 \ft Assumed.\f* \add told\add* Mosheh, “Tell the Israelis, ‘You’re all \add stubborn\add* people. If I went with you for \add even\add* one moment, then I’d destroy you. \add So\add* now, take off your \add jewellery and anything fancy that you’re wearing\add*, and then I’ll know what I’ll do to you.’ ”
\v 6 \add So\add* from Mt. Sinai \add onwards\add*, the Israelis stripped themselves of their \add jewellery and fancy things\add*.
\s1 The tent for meeting God
\p
\v 7 \add From that day onwards,\add* Mosheh would take a tent and would put it up at a distance outside the camp—he called it ‘the tent of meeting’. Then anyone \add who wanted a decision from\add* Yahweh would go out to that tent of meeting outside the camp.
\v 8 Whenever Mosheh went out to the tent, all the people would stand up at the entrance of their own tents, and they would watch Mosheh go out until he went into the tent.
\v 9 Once \add he\add* entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stand at the entrance of the tent, and \add Yahweh\add* would speak with \add him\add*.
\v 10 \add When\add* all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, \add they\add* would get up and bow down at the entrance of \add their\add* \add own\add* \add tents\add*.
\v 11 Yahweh would speak to Mosheh face to face like someone speaks to \add their\add* friend. Then Mosheh would return to the camp, but his servant Yehoshua (a young man who was the son of Nun) would not leave the inside of the tent.
\s1 Mosheh sees the master’s splendour
\p
\v 12 Then Mosheh said to Yahweh, “Listen, you’ve been saying to me, ‘Take \add these\add* people \add onwards\add*,’ but you haven’t let me know who you’ll send with me, although you have said, ‘I know you by name, and you’ve also found favour in my \add sight\add*.’
\v 13 \add So\add* now please, if I’ve found favour in your \add sight\add*, please \add help\add* me to know your ways. Then I’ll know you so that I can find favour in your \add sight\add*. And \add don’t forget\add* that this nation is \em your\em* people.”
\p
\v 14 \add Yahweh\add* \add replied\add*, “My \add presence\add* will go \add with you\add* and I will \add help\add* you \add to be able to\add* rest.”
\p
\v 15 \add Mosheh\add* \add replied\add* to him, “If your \add presence\add* isn’t \add coming with us\add*, then don’t \add make us leave\add* here.
\v 16 \add How would anyone know\add* that I’ve found favour in your \add sight\add*—me and your people \add that is\add*—if you didn’t \add come\add* with us? \add How could\add* I and your people be distinguished from all the \add other\add* people \add groups\add* \add in the world\add*?”
\p
\v 17 Yahweh \add replied\add* to Mosheh, “\add Okay,\add* I’ll also do \add what you’ve asked\add* because you’ve found favour in my \add sight\add* and I know you by name.”
\p
\v 18 Then \add Mosheh\add*, “Please show me your splendour.”
\p
\v 19 Yahweh \add replied\add*, “I myself will cause all my goodness to pass over \add in front of you\add*, and I will \add say\add* \add my\add* name of Yahweh \add in front of you\add*. I will favour \add anyone I want\add*, and I’ll be compassionate to \add whoever I want\add*.”\x + \xo 33:19: \xt Rom 9:15.\x*
\v 20 \add But\add* he said, “You won’t be able to see my face, because no human can see me and \add still\add* live.”
\v 21 \add He\add* \add continued\add*, “Look, there’s a place near me where you can \add stand there\add* on the rock.
\v 22 Then while my splendour passes over, I’ll put you in a crevice in the rock, and my hand will cover you until I’ve gone past.
\v 23 Then I’ll take my hand away and you’ll be able to see my back, but \add you mustn’t try to look at\add* my face.”
\c 34
\s1 The replacement stone slabs
\r (Deu. 10:1-5)
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add continued\add* speaking to Mosheh, “Carve two slabs of stone for yourself just like the first \add ones\add*. Then the words that were on the first tablets that you broke, I’ll write them \add again\add* on the slabs.
\v 2 Be ready by morning, and in the morning come up to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to me up on the top.
\v 3 Don’t bring anyone with you, and also don’t let anyone be on the mountain at all—don’t even let their flocks and herds graze \add at the base\add* of that mountain.”
\v 4 \add So\add* \add Mosheh\add* carved out two slabs of stone like the first \add ones\add*, and \add he\add* got up early in the morning and went up to Mount Sinai as Yahweh had commanded him, carrying up the two slabs of stone.
\v 5 Then Yahweh came down in the cloud and stood with him there, and he pronounced \add his\add* name ‘Yahweh’.
\v 6 Yahweh passed over above his face and proclaimed, “I am Yahweh, a compassionate and gracious God, \add slow to get angry but exuding\add* faithfulness and trustworthiness.\x + \xo 34:6-7: \xt Exo 20:5-6; Num 14:18; Deu 5:9-10; 7:9-10.\x*
\v 7 \add I\add* display faithfulness to thousands \add of generations\add*—forgiving disobedience, transgression, and sin. But \add I\add* certainly won’t let the guilty \add get away with it\add*—visiting the iniquity of the \add parents\add* onto the \add children\add* and onto the \add grandchildren\add*—to the third and the fourth \add generations\add*.”
\p
\v 8 Mosheh hurried and bowed to the ground and worshipped \add Yahweh\add*
\v 9 and said, “Please, if I have found favour in your \add sight\add*, my master, please go with us, because \add these\add* are \add stubborn\add* people. And forgive our disobedience and our sin and \add take us as your inheritance\add*.”
\p
\v 10 \add Yahweh\add* said, “Listen, I’m about to make an agreement in front of all your people.\f + \fr 34:10 \ft Because there’s no punctuation in the original Hebrew, it’s not certain if ‘in front of all your people’ goes with what it follows (as the \em OET-RV\em* has chosen), or with what follows it (as in several other translations).\f* I will do miracles that have not been \add done before\add* anywhere on the earth or in any country \add of the world\add*. All the people that you’re among will see \add my\add* work, because what I’m going to do with you is \add awe-inspiring\add*.
\v 11 \add Be sure to obey\add* what I’m telling you today. See, I’m about to force the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Yebusites out of the land ahead of you.
\v 12 \add Be very careful\add* not to make any treaties with any of the \add current\add* inhabitants of the land that you’re about to enter, in case it ends up trapping you.
\v 13 \add What you must do instead is to\add* break down their altars and smash their pillars, and cut down the poles \add used to worship their god\add* Asherah.\x + \xo 34:13: \xt Deu 16:21.\x*
\v 14 You must not bow down to any other god because Yahweh is a jealous God—jealous \add to protect\add* his name.
\v 15 So don’t make an agreement with the \add inhabitants\add* of the land, \add because when\add* they prostitute \add themselves\add* to their gods and sacrifice to \add them\add*, and then \add they\add* invite you \add to join them\add* and you eat some of \add their\add* sacrifice,
\v 16 then \add you’ll end up by\add* allowing your sons to marry their daughters who’ll prostitute \add themselves\add* to their gods, and then your sons \add will do the same\add*.
\p
\v 17 Don’t make cast metal gods for yourselves.\x + \xo 34:17: \xt Exo 20:4; Lev 19:4; Deu 5:8; 27:15.\x*
\p
\v 18 You must observe the Flat Bread Celebration \add every year\add* as I instructed you. For seven days you must eat \add only\add* bread that hasn’t been risen, at the appointed time in late March or early April because that’s when you came out of Egypt.\x + \xo 34:18: \xt Exo 12:14-20; Lev 23:6-8; Num 28:16-25.\x*
\v 19 All of your eldest male offspring belong to me, \add including your sons\add* and the first males born from your cattle and sheep and goats.\x + \xo 34:19: \xt Exo 13:2.\x*
\v 20 If it’s a male donkey, a lamb can be given as a ransom instead, but if you don’t pay a ransom then you must kill the donkey. \add It’s compulsory to\add* ransom your eldest sons. \add Don’t come to worship me without bringing something\add*.\x + \xo 34:20: \xt Exo 13:13.\x*
\p
\v 21 \add Each week,\add* you should only work for six days, then you must rest on the seventh day—\add even\add* during ploughing and harvest times.\x + \xo 34:21: \xt Exo 20:9-10; 23:12; 31:15; 35:2; Lev 23:3; Deu 5:13-14.\x*
\p
\v 22 \add In the spring\add* when you begin to harvest the first wheat crop, you must have a \it Celebration of Weeks\it*, and at the end of the year \add in the autumn\add*, have a \it \add Finished\add* Harvest Celebration\it*.\x + \xo 34:22: a \xt Exo 23:16; Lev 23:15-21; Num 28:26-31; \xo b \xt Lev 23:39-43.\x*
\p
\v 23 Three times every year, all your men must present themselves before me—Isra’el’s God, the master Yahweh.
\v 24 I will drive out the people groups ahead of you and expand your borders, and no one will \add think of taking\add* your land \add when they know that\add* you present yourselves to \add me\add* three times a year.
\p
\v 25 Don’t \add wave bread\add* \add that’s been risen\add* when offering a sacrifice. Don’t allow any part of the sacrifice for the ‘pass-over’ celebration to \add still be there in\add* the morning.\x + \xo 34:25: \xt Exo 12:10.\x*
\p
\v 26 You must bring the best of the first parts of your harvests to \add my\add* residence.\x + \xo 34:26: a \xt Deu 26:2; \xo b \xt Deu 14:21.\x*
\p Don’t boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.
\p
\v 27 Yahweh \add told\add* Mosheh, “Write down these words for yourself, because \add it’s in accordance with\add* these words that I’ve made an agreement with you and with Yisrael.”
\v 28 \add Mosheh\add* was there with Yahweh for forty days and nights, and \add during that time\add* he didn’t eat or \add even\add* drink water, and he wrote the ten commands of the agreement on the \add stone\add* slabs.
\p
\v 29 \add So when\add* Mosheh came down from Mt. Sinai, he was carrying the two \add stone\add* slabs with the transcript \add of the ten commands\add*, \add but\add* what he didn’t know as he descended was that the skin on his face was shining after his talking with \add Yahweh\add*.\x + \xo 34:29-35: \xt 2Cor 3:7-16.\x*
\v 30 \add When\add* Aharon and the Israelis saw Mosheh, wow, \add his face radiated light\add* and they were afraid to go close to him.
\v 31 \add But\add* Mosheh called them \add over\add*, and Aharon and all of the community leaders returned back to him, and \add he\add* spoke with them.
\v 32 After that, the Israelis came closer, and \add Mosheh\add* gave them all the instructions that Yahweh had told him on Mt. Sinai.
\v 33 \add Then when\add* \add he’d\add* finished talking to them, \add Mosheh\add* put a veil over his face,
\v 34 and whenever \add he\add* would go in to speak with Yahweh, he would remove the veil until he came out. \add Whenever\add* he did come out, he’d tell the Israelis what he’d been instructed,
\v 35 and \add they\add* would see how \add his\add* face shone. Then Mosheh would put the veil back over his face until he went in \add the next time\add* to speak with \add Yahweh\add*.
\c 35
\s1 Instructions for the rest day
\p
\v 1 Mosheh assembled all the Israelis and told them, “These are the things that Yahweh has instructed you to do.
\v 2 \add Every week\add*, you can work for six days, but the seventh day will be a sacred rest day, \add dedicated to\add* Yahweh. Anyone who works on that day must be put to death.\x + \xo 35:2: \xt Exo 20:8-11; 23:12; 31:15; 34:21; Lev 23:3; Deu 5:12-14.\x*
\v 3 Don’t light a fire\f + \fr 35:3 \ft This is effectively a command not to do any \bd cooking\bd* on the rest day.\f* in any of your homes on the rest days.”
\s1 The offering for Yahweh
\r (Exo. 25:1-9)
\p
\v 4 Then Mosheh told all the assembled Israelis, “This is what Yahweh instructed:
\v 5 Take up an offering for Yahweh—everyone \add who wants to participate should\add* bring to Yahweh their contribution of gold, silver, bronze,
\v 6 blue, purple, or scarlet yarn, finely-spun linen and goats’ hair,
\v 7 reddened ram skins, sea-cow hides, and acacia wood,
\v 8 \add olive\add* oil for the lamps and spices to make the anointing oil and the fragrant incense,
\v 9 and onyx and other gemstones for the \add priest’s\add* sacred apron and chest pouch.
\s1 The equipment for the holy tent
\r (Exo. 39:32-43)
\p
\v 10 Everyone among you all who’s \add highly skilled\add* should come and make everything that Yahweh has instructed—
\v 11 the tent for the residence and its covering, its clasps and frames, its bars, pillars, and bases,
\v 12 the box with its poles and the atonement platform \add to go on top\add*, the curtain for screening \add it\add*,
\v 13 the table and its poles and all its utensils and the sacred bread,
\v 14 the lampstand for light with its lamps and utensils and oil \add to burn\add*,
\v 15 the incense altar and its poles, the anointing oil and fragrant incense, the curtain for the entrance of the residence,
\v 16 the altar for the burnt offerings with its bronze grate, its poles and all of its utensils, the washbasin with its base,
\v 17 the courtyard curtains with their pillars and bases, and the curtain for the courtyard gate,
\v 18 the tent pegs and ropes for the residence and the courtyard,
\v 19 the finely-woven clothing for serving in the Holy Place, the sacred clothes for Aharon the priest, and the clothes for his sons to serve as priests.”
\s1 The people’s offerings
\p
\v 20 Then all the Israelis who’d been assembled in front of Mosheh went away,
\v 21 and everyone who \add felt to do so\add* came \add back\add* bringing their contributions to Yahweh for the work on the sacred tent and all its components, and for the sacred clothes.
\v 22 This included both men and women who were \add wanting to contribute\add*, and they brought necklaces and earrings and ornaments—all made of gold. They held them up high as a raised offering of gold to Yahweh.
\v 23 \add Many people\add* who had blue or purple or scarlet yarn, or finely-spun linen or goats’ hair, reddened ram skins or sea-cow hides brought \add them\add*.
\v 24 \add Others who could,\add* brought a contribution of silver or bronze to Yahweh, and those with acacia wood brought \add it\add* for all the \add construction of the tent components\add*.
\v 25 All the women who were \add skilled at making cloth\add* brought blue, purple, or scarlet yarn and fine, hand-spun linen thread,
\v 26 and all those women who \add felt to do so\add* spun goats’ hair.
\v 27 The leaders brought onyx stones and other gemstones to be mounted on the sacred apron and for the sacred pouch,
\v 28 along with the spices and \add olive\add* oil to be used for the maps, the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense.
\v 29 \add Thus\add* the Israelis brought a voluntary offering to Yahweh—every man and woman who \add felt to do so\add* brought something for all the work which Yahweh had instructed them through Mosheh to do.
\s1 The skills of Bezalel and Oholiab
\r (Exo. 31:1-11)
\p
\v 30 Then Mosheh said to the Israelis, “Listen, Yahweh has called Bezalel by name (the son of Hur’s son Uri, from the tribe of Judah)
\v 31 and he has filled him with \add his\add* spirit, with skill and understanding, and with knowledge and with all kinds of craftsmanship.
\v 32 \add He can\add* design designs, work in gold, silver, and bronze,
\v 33 in cutting gemstones for setting, and in wood-carving—to do all kinds of design and crafting.
\v 34 \add Yahweh\add* has also \add given him the desire\add* to teach, along with Oholiab (Ahisamak’s son from the tribe of Dan).
\v 35 He’s given them \add both\add* skills to do all the work of craftsmen and of skillful workmen and of embroiderers in blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and in the fine linen and of weavers—\add both\add* as designers as well as the various, actual crafts.
\c 36
\nb
\v 1 Bezalel and Oholiab will do the work of constructing all the components of the sacred tent along with any others who are \add like-minded\add* and who have been given the necessary skills and understanding by Yahweh.”

\v 2 \add So\add* Mosheh summoned Bezalel and Oholiab, as well as anyone else \add who felt to help\add* and had been given the \add appropriate\add* skills by Yahweh,
\v 3 and they took \add away\add* all the contributions that the Israelis had brought to Mosheh to be used for the construction of the sacred tent. \add However\add* \add the people\add* \add still\add* continued to bring voluntary offerings every morning.
\v 4 \add So\add* all those skilled \add people\add* came \add over\add* to \add start on\add* the work of \add making\add* the sacred tent, Holy Place came, \add leaving behind\add* the work that they had been doing,
\v 5 and they \add informed\add* Mosheh, “The people are bringing way more than enough to use for the work that Yahweh has instructed us to do.”
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* with Mosheh’s \add agreement\add*, they spread a message around the camp saying, “\add Please don’t bring\add* any more contributions for the sacred tent.” \add So\add* the people—men and women—stopped bringing \add donations\add*
\v 7 as \add they had already collected\add* more than enough materials for all the work.
\s1 The construction of the tent
\r (Exo. 26:1-37)
\p
\v 8 Then all the \add most-skilled men\add* out of the workmen made the ten \add strips of\add* curtaining for the residence from twisted finely-spun linen and blue, purple, scarlet yarn \add used to embroider\add* winged-creatures on them.
\v 9 Each \add strip\add* was 14.5m long and two metres wide—they were all the same size.
\v 10 Five \add strips\add* were sewn together as one set, and the other five as another set.
\v 11 \add They\add*\f + \fr 36:11 \ft It’s singular ‘he’ in the original, which is confusing after v8 mentioned a group of craftsmen. The \em OET-RV\em* has chosen to follow v8 (and change the pronoun to ‘they’ in this section), but other translations are divided in how they handle this dilemma.\f* made loops of blue on the edge of the first curtain at the edge of the set, and similarly for the second set—
\v 12 fifty \add matching\add* loops on the edge of each set so they were aligned with each other.
\v 13 \add They\add* \add also\add* made fifty gold clips and used them to join the \add two\add* curtain \add sets\add* to each other to make \add the wall of\add* the sacred tent.
\p
\v 14 Then \add they\add* made eleven goats’ hair curtain sections for the tarpaulin over the sacred tent.
\v 15 All eleven \add sections\add* were the same size at fifteen metres long and two metres wide,
\v 16 and they joined five \add sections\add* to each other \add for one set\add* and six for the other.
\v 17 Then \add they\add* \add attached\add* fifty \add blue\add* loops onto one edge of each of the two sets
\v 18 and made fifty bronze clips for connecting them into one \add continuous\add* cover.
\v 19 \add They\add* then made a tarpaulin from red rams skins to go over the tent, and the top \add waterproof\add* tarpaulin of sea-cow hides.
\p
\v 20 Then \add they\add* made \add forty-eight\add* upright frames from acacia wood for the sacred tent.
\v 21 Each frame was five metres long and 0.75m wide
\v 22 with two protrusions on each frame for connecting them together, so all the frames were made in this way.
\v 23 \add They\add* made twenty frames for the south side
\v 24 with their forty silver bases—two bases under each frame that two \add more\add* protrusions fitted \add down\add* into,
\v 25 then two \add more\add* for the north side
\v 26 with their forty silver bases—two bases under each frame.
\v 27 Six frames were made for the west side
\v 28 as well as two frames for the back corners of the sacred tent.
\v 29 At the two corners, \add the frames\add* were connected together at the bottom, and \add similarly\add* at the top before being attached to a single ring
\v 30 \add so\add* that made eight frames with their sixteen silver bases—two bases under each frame.
\p
\v 31 Then \add they\add* made crossbars from acacia wood—five for the frames on the \add north\add* side of the sacred tent,
\v 32 five for the \add south\add* side, and five crossbars for the frames on the west \add side\add* along the back.
\v 33 The middle crossbar was made to pass through from \add one\add* end to \add the other\add* in the centre of the frames,
\v 34 and the frames were overlaid with gold. \add They\add* then made gold rings to be the holders for the crossbars, and \add they\add* \add too\add* were overlaid with gold.
\p
\v 35 \add They\add* made a curtain from twisted finely-spun linen, and a skillful workman embroidered winged creatures on them with blue, purple, scarlet yarn.
\v 36 \add They\add* made four pillars of acacia wood overlaid with gold, as well as their gold hooks and four bases cast from silver.
\v 37 \add They\add* made a curtain for the tent entrance—an embroiderer made it from twisted finely-spun linen and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn,
\v 38 along with it’s five pillars and their hooks. The tops of the pillars were overlaid with gold, and their five bases \add were made of\add* bronze.
\c 37
\s1 Making the sacred box
\r (Exo. 25:10-22)
\p
\v 1 Then Bezalel made the sacred chest from acacia wood—it was 1.2m long, 0.75m wide, and 0.75m high.
\v 2 He overlaid \add both\add* the inside and the outside with pure gold, and made a gold moulding all around it,
\v 3 and he cast four rings of gold \add and attached them\add* to its four feet—two rings on each one side.
\v 4 He made \add two\add* acacia wood poles and overlaid them with gold,
\v 5 and he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the box for carrying it.
\p
\v 6 Then he made the atonement platform from pure gold \add to fit\add* as the lid for the box, \add so\add* it was \add also\add* 1.2m long and 0.75m wide,
\v 7 then from the ends of the lid, he hammered the gold to form two winged creatures.
\v 8 There was a winged creature sitting on each end of the atonement platform made from its two ends,
\v 9 and they were spreading their wings upwards to cover over the platform. They faced each other, \add looking down towards\add* the atonement platform.
\s1 Making the bread table
\r (Exo. 25:23-30)
\p
\v 10 He made \add the bread\add* table from acacia wood—one metre long, half a metre wide, and three-quarters of a metre high.
\v 11 It was overlaid with pure gold and had a gold moulding all around it.
\v 12 He made an 8cm wide rim all around it, and a gold moulding around the rim.
\v 13 He moulded four gold rings from gold and attached them to the four corners of the table. Each ring was close to each table leg
\v 14 near the rim to hold the poles for carrying the table.
\v 15 He made \add two\add* acacia wood poles and overlaid them for gold—they were for carrying the table.
\v 16 He \add also\add* made the utensils that would be on the table—its plates and pans, and its bowls and pitchers to be used for pouring out \add the wine offerings\add*—all made from pure gold.
\s1 Making the lampstand
\r (Exo. 25:31-40)
\p
\v 17 Then he made the lampstand from pure gold. The base and shaft of the lampstand were hammered \add into shape\add*, along with its cups, and its buds and blossoms.
\v 18 There were six branches going out from the shaft of the lampstand—three on each side.
\v 19 Each branch had three gold cups on it that looked like almond flowers with buds and petals. It was the same for each of the lampstand’s six branches.
\v 20 On the lampstand \add shaft\add* there were four cups that also looked like almond blossoms, each one with flower buds and petals.
\v 21 He made one flower bud beneath every pair of branches \add (that were going out from opposite sides)\add*. The bud was attached to each pair of branches as if they were growing out of it—all six lampstand branches were attached like that.
\v 22 The buds and the branches coming out of them were all hammered out of one piece of pure gold.
\v 23 Then he made the seven lamps out of pure gold, along with the tongs and trays.
\v 24 He made \add the lampstand\add* and tongs and trays using 33kg of pure gold.
\s1 Making the incense altar
\r (Exo. 30:1-5)
\p
\v 25 Then he made the altar \add for burning\add* incense out of acacia wood. It was square—half a metre on each side—and one metre high. Its projections \add on the top four corners\add* were part of it.
\v 26 He overlaid it with pure gold—all four sides including the projections—and put a gold moulding all around it.
\v 27 Then he made two gold rings \add and attached them\add* below the moulding—two on each side for holding the poles for carrying \add the altar\add*.
\v 28 The \add two\add* poles were made from acacia wood and then overlaid with gold.
\v 29 He got a \add professional\add* ointment maker to make the sacred anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense.\x + \xo 37:29: \xt Exo 30:22-38.\x*
\c 38
\s1 Making the altar for burning sacrifices
\r (Exo. 27:1-8)
\p
\v 1 Then \add Bezalel\add* made the altar for burning offerings from acacia wood. It was square—2.5m on each side—and 1.5m tall.
\v 2 \add From the same piece of wood\add*, he made horn-like projections for each of the four corners, then he overlaid it all with bronze.
\v 3 He made all the utensils for the altar: the pots and shovels, basins and meat-forks, and the firepans—all made from bronze.
\v 4 He made a grating for the altar—a bronze lattice \add that fitted\add* \add down in the middle of the altar\add*,
\v 5 and he cast the grating with rings on the four corners as holders for the \add carrying\add* poles.
\v 6 He made the acacia wood poles and overlaid them with bronze
\v 7 and he put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar so they could carry it with them. He made \add the altar\add* hollow using boards.
\s1 Making the washbasin
\r (Exo. 30:18)
\p
\v 8 Then he made a bronze washbasin and base. \add They were made\add* with the bronze from the mirrors of the serving women who served at the entrance of the sacred tent.\x + \xo 38:8: \xt Exo 30:18.\x*
\s1 Making the courtyard
\r (Exo. 27:9-19)
\p
\v 9 Then \add Bezalel\add* worked on the courtyard. For the south side, the courtyard curtains were fifty metres of twisted finely-spun linen
\v 10 with their twenty \add bronze\add* pillars and their bases. The hooks on the pillars and their rings were made of silver.
\v 11 On the north side, there were fifty metres of curtains with their twenty bronze pillars and bases, and their silver hooks and rings.
\v 12 On the west side, there were twenty-five metres of curtains with their ten pillars and bases, and their silver hooks and rings,
\v 13 and \add another\add* twenty-five metres on the east side.
\v 14 The curtains for \add one\add* side \add of the entrance\add* were 7.5m long with their three pillars and their bases.
\v 15 On the \add other\add* side, opposite the courtyard entrance, the curtains were 7.5m long with their three pillars and their bases.
\v 16 All of the courtyard curtains were made with twisted finely-spun linen.
\v 17 The bases for the pillars were bronze, \add but\add* the hooks on them and their rings were silver. All of the courtyard pillars had decorative silver caps fitted to their tops.
\v 18 The curtain for the courtyard gate was done by an embroiderer. It was made from twisted finely-spun linen \add embroidered\add* with blue, purple, and scarlet yard. The curtain was ten metres long and 2.5m high, just like the other courtyard curtains
\v 19 with its four bronze pillars and their bases and their silver hooks and rings, and with silver caps.
\v 20 All the tent pegs for the sacred tent and for around the courtyard were made with bronze.
\s1 List of metals used
\p
\v 21 These are the records \add from making\add* the sacred tent (where the \add stone\add* transcripts were kept). They were recorded by the Levites according to Mosheh’s instructions \add and supervised by\add* Ithamar (a son of Aharon the priest).
\p
\v 22 Bezalel (son of Uri son of Hur, from the tribe of Judah) made everything that Yahweh had instructed Mosheh \add to make\add*.
\v 23 Oholiab (son of Ahisamak, from the tribe of Dan) worked with him—he was an engraver and a designer and an embroiderer in blue, purple, and scarlet, and in fine linen.
\p
\v 24 The gold that they used for the construction of the sacred tent was measured at 965kg. This was the gold from the wave offering and was weighed using the official standard weights.
\v 25 The silver contributed by the people was measured at 3,420kg \add also\add* using the official weights.\x + \xo 38:25-26: \xt Exo 30:11-16.\x*
\v 26 \add During the census,\add* every male who was twenty years old or older paid a 5g silver coin—a total of 603,550 men.\x + \xo 38:26: \xt Mat 17:24.\x*
\v 27 They’d used 3,400kg of silver to make the bases under the pillars that supported the sacred tent’s curtains (34kg for each of one hundred bases)
\v 28 and the other twenty kilograms were used for the hooks for the pillars and for the caps on the tops of them.
\v 29 The bronze from the wave offering came to 2,400kg
\v 30 and it was used to make the bases \add for the pillars\add* at the tent entrance and for the altar and its grating and all the utensils,
\v 31 and for the bases \add for the posts\add* for \add the curtains\add* around the courtyard and at the entrance, and for the tent pegs for the \add main structure\add* and around the courtyard.
\c 39
\s1 Making the priests’ uniforms
\r (Exo. 28:1-14)
\p
\v 1 They used the blue, purple, and scarlet \add cloth\add* to make the sacred clothes to be used in the sacred tent. They made Aharon’s clothes just as Yahweh had instructed Mosheh.
\s2 The sacred apron
\p
\v 2 \add Bezalel\add* made the sacred apron from twisted finely-spun linen \add embroidered with\add* gold \add wire\add*, and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.
\v 3 They hammered thin sheets of gold and he cut them into thread of wire for a skillful craftsman to \add embroider\add* into the fine linen along with the blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.
\v 4 They made joined shoulder pieces for it—joined on two corners
\v 5 and the skillfully woven waistband which is attached to the apron was made of the same material of twisted finely-spun linen, and had similar embroidery using gold \add wire\add*, and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, just as Yahweh had instructed Mosheh.
\v 6 They cut \add two\add* onyx stones and mounted them in decorative gold settings. The names of the \add twelve\add* sons of Yisra’el were engraved on \add them\add* similar to how a signet ring is engraved,
\v 7 and he put them on the shoulder pieces of the sacred apron as stones of reminder for the sons of Yisra’el, as Yahweh had instructed Mosheh.
\s1 Making the sacred pouch
\r (Exo. 28:15-30)
\p
\v 8 Then he made the sacred chest pouch which took the work of a skilled craftsman like making the sacred apron. It too was made of twisted finely-spun linen and embroidered with gold \add wire\add*, and blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.
\v 9 When the material was folded over double, it made a square pouch that was 23cm long and 23cm wide,
\v 10 and they attached four rows of gemstones onto the front. The first row had a \add red\add* ruby, a \add yellow\add* topaz, and a \add red\add* garnet.
\v 11 The second row had a \add green\add* emerald, a \add blue\add* sapphire, and a diamond.
\v 12 The third row had a \add red\add* jacinth, a \add white\add* agate, and a \add purple\add* amethyst.
\v 13 The fourth row had a \add yellow\add* beryl, an onyx, and a \add green\add* jasper. \add All the stones\add* were mounted in decorative gold settings.
\v 14 The gemstones were engraved with the names of the twelve sons of Yisra’el similar to how a signet ring is engraved, and they represented the twelve tribes.
\v 15 They \add attached two\add* twisted chains of pure gold crafted like a cord onto the pouch,
\v 16 and made two decorative gold settings and two gold rings, and attached them to the \add upper corners\add* of the sacred pouch.
\v 17 They attached one end of each gold chain to one of the rings on the \add top corner\add* of the pouch,
\v 18 and they attached the other end of each chain to the two decorative settings that enclose the stones. Then they put those on the front side of the shoulder straps of the sacred apron.
\v 19 Then they made two \add more\add* gold rings and attached them to the \add lower corners\add* of the sacred pouch on the inside edges next to the sacred apron.
\v 20 They made two more gold rings and attached them to the lower part of the front of the shoulder straps near where the shoulder straps join with the sacred apron just above the waistband.
\v 21 They tied the rings on the sacred pouch to the rings on the sacred apron with a blue cord, so that the sacred pouch was above the waistband and would not come loose from the apron. They did these things exactly as Yahweh had instructed Mosheh \add to do\add*.
\s1 Making the other clothes
\r (Exo. 28:31-43)
\p
\v 22 \add Bezalel\add* had a weaver make the robe \add that would be worn under\add* the sacred apron entirely from blue \add material\add*.
\v 23 It opened down the middle like other clothes and had a border around this opening so that it wouldn’t tear,
\v 24 and the bottom hem had \add decorative\add* pomegranates on it that were made from blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.
\v 25 They \add also\add* made \add small\add* bells from pure gold and attached them between the pomegranates around the bottom of the robe,
\v 26 so it alternated between a bell and a pomegranate going around the hem, just as Yahweh had instructed Mosheh.
\p
\v 27 A weaver made tunics for Aaron and his sons from fine linen,
\v 28 along with the turban and caps from fine linen, the underwear made from twisted finely-spun linen,
\v 29 and the waistband from fine linen with blue, purple, and scarlet embroidery, just as Yahweh had instructed Mosheh.
\p
\v 30 They made a \add decorative\add* plate (to represent a holy crown) from pure gold and they engraved ‘Dedicated to Yahweh’ on it (like you’d do for a signet ring).
\v 31 They put a blue cord on it to attach it to the front of the turban, just as Yahweh had instructed Mosheh.
\s1 Mosheh inspects the finished components
\r (Exo. 35:10-19)
\p
\v 32 And \add so\add* all the components of the residence, the tent for meeting \add God\add*, were finished—the Israelis had done just what Yahweh had instructed Mosheh.
\v 33 \add The craftsmen\add* brought the \add disassembled\add* residence to Mosheh—the tent and all its equipment, the clips, the frames with their bars, and the pillars with their bases,
\v 34 the reddened rams hide tarpaulin and the top sea-cow hide tarpaulin, the curtain for covering \add the most sacred place\add*,
\v 35 the box for the transcript slabs and its poles, the atonement platform,
\v 36 the table with all its utensils and the sacred bread to present to God,
\v 37 the pure lampstand with its row of lamps and all its utensils and the lamp oil,
\v 38 the gold \add incense\add* altar, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the curtain for the tent entrance,
\v 39 the \add large\add* bronze altar with its grating, its poles, and all its utensils, the washbasin with its base,
\v 40 the courtyard curtains with their pillars and bases, the courtyard gate curtain, \add all the\add* ropes and tent pegs and all the items to service the residence as the tent of meeting,
\v 41 and the finely-woven clothes for serving in the holy place, the sacred clothes for Aharon the priest, and the clothes for his sons to \add serve as\add* priests.
\p
\v 42 The Israelis had done all the work just as Yahweh had instructed Mosheh.
\v 43 Mosheh \add inspected\add* all the work, and wow, they had done it just as Yahweh had instructed \add them\add*, and Mosheh blessed them.
\c 40
\s1 Erecting the sacred tent
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh told Mosheh,
\v 2 “On the first day of the first month, you should set-up the tent \add where we’ll meet\add*.
\v 3 Put the box for the transcript slabs in its place and \add hang\add* the curtain to screen it \add from sight\add*.
\v 4 Then bring in the \add bread\add* table and arrange its utensils, and bring in the lampstand and set up the lamps,
\v 5 and put the gold incense altar in front of the sacred box and set-up the entrance curtain for the tent.
\v 6 Put the altar for burning sacrifices in front of the entrance to the sacred tent \add where we’ll meet\add*.
\v 7 Put the washbasin between the sacred tent and that altar, and fill it with water.
\v 8 \add Set-up the curtains around the outside to make the courtyard, and also set-up the courtyard’s entrance curtain\add*.
\p
\v 9 Then take the \add sacred\add* anointing oil and \add smear\add* it on the sacred tent and everything that’s in it, then \add none of those things should be touched by others\add*—it will \add all\add* be sacred.
\v 10 \add Also\add* anoint the altar for burnt offerings and all its utensils. After that, the altar \add shouldn’t be touched by others\add*—it will be \em very\em* sacred.
\v 11 Anoint the washbasin and its base, and then \add prohibit others from using\add* it.
\p
\v 12 \add Now\add* bring Aharon and his sons to the entrance of the sacred tent and wash them with water.
\v 13 Then put the sacred garments on Aharon and anoint him and make him sacred, so he can \add now\add* serve as a priest to me.
\v 14 \add Also\add* bring his sons and dress them in tunics
\v 15 and anoint them like you anointed their father, and they will serve as priests to me. Their anointing will cause them to be a priesthood forever throughout their generations.”
\p
\v 16 \add So\add* Mosheh did \add everything\add* that Yahweh had instructed him \add to do\add*.
\v 17 It was the first day of the first month of \add their\add* second year when they set-up the sacred tent.
\v 18 Mosheh set-up the residence by setting out its bases and standing up the frames with their bars, and the pillars.
\v 19 He spread the \add two tarpaulin layers\add* over the tent just as Yahweh had instructed \add him\add*.
\v 20 Then he took the \add two stone slabs with the\add* transcript and put \add them\add* into the box. He put the poles \add into the rings\add* on the box and fitted the atonement platform on the top of the box \add as a lid\add*,
\v 21 and brought the box into the residence. He set-up the curtain to conceal the box with the transcript, just as Yahweh had instructed \add him\add*.
\p
\v 22 He put the table into the sacred tent on the north side of the residence, outside the curtain,
\v 23 and arranged the bread on it \add to display it to\add* Yahweh, just as Yahweh had instructed \add him\add*.
\v 24 He put the lampstand inside the sacred tent across from the table, on the south side of the residence,
\v 25 and he placed the lamps on it \add in Yahweh’s presence\add*, just as Yahweh had instructed \add him\add*.
\v 26 Then he put the gold \add incense\add* altar inside the sacred tent in front of the curtain \add that screened the sacred box from view\add*,
\v 27 and burnt some fragrant incense on it, just as Yahweh had instructed \add him\add*,
\v 28 then he hung the curtain at the tent entrance.
\v 29 He put the altar for burning sacrifices at the gate of the sacred tent and offered the burnt offering and the grain offering up on it, just as Yahweh had instructed \add him\add*.
\v 30 Then he placed the washbasin between the tent and the altar, and filled it with water
\v 31 \add so that\add* Mosheh, and Aharon and his sons, could wash their hands and feet from it.
\v 32 Whenever they went into the sacred tent or whenever they went near the altar, \add first\add* they would wash themselves, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 33 He erected the courtyard \add curtains\add* around the residence and the altar, and he set-up the courtyard gate curtain. And \add so\add* Mosheh finished the work.
\s1 Yahweh’s splendour fills the tent
\r (Num. 9:15-23)
\p
\v 34 Then a cloud covered the sacred tent and Yahweh’s \add power and bright light\add* filled the residence\x + \xo 40:34: \xt 1Ki 8:10-11; Isa 6:4; Eze 43:4-5; Rev 15:8.\x*
\v 35 and Mosheh was unable to enter the tent because the cloud had settled on it and Yahweh’s splendour had filled the residence.
\v 36 \add From then onwards,\add* whenever the cloud went up from over the residence, the Israelis would \add pack their camp and\add* set out on their travels,
\v 37 but while the cloud remained, they would stay in that place until the cloud lifted.
\v 38 Yahweh’s cloud would be there during the day \add but\add* it would become fire at night, and so the Israelis \add could always see it\add*.
