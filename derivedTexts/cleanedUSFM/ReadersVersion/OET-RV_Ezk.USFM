\mt1 (Ezekiel)
\is1 Introduction
\ip Yehezkel (or more properly ‘Yehezk’el’ which means ‘God/El will strengthen’, but called ‘Ezekiel’ in older English translations because Greek has no ‘y’ or ‘h’) was a priest in Yerushalem (Jerusalem). He was one of the many people who were captured by the Babylonian army and marched off to Babylon before Yerushalem was defeated in 586 B.C. So he lived in Babylon and became a prophet five years after he’d been exiled. His message was directed to the people exiled to Babylon as well as those back in Yerushalem. Yehezkel’s account can be divided into six parts: 1. God’s calling Yehezkel as a prophet; 2. warnings to the people there about God’s coming punishment of them, and of the coming destruction of Yerushalem; 3. God’s messages about the punishment of various nations who’d attacked Israel; 4. comforting Yisrael when enemies defeated Yerushalem, and a promise of a future, better life; 5. the defeat of all of Yisrael’s enemies; 6. Yehezkel’s description of a restored temple and of a nation that would return to living there.
\ip Yehezkel demonstrated a lot of faith, and his messages came as visions—many of which he had to act out. Yehezkel explained the importance of a new heart and spirit, and how it’s necessary for each person to individually repent from their sins. He reveals Yisrael’s hope of a new life. Then as prophet and priest, he greatly looks forward to a new temple with all the rooms that are necessary for the sacred services.

\ms1 Yehezkel’s calling to be a prophet
\mr (1:1–3:27)
\s1 Yahweh reveals himself
\p
\v 1 \add When I was\add* thirty years \add old\add*, on July 5th as I was \add living with the other captives\add* by the Kevar Canal, the skies opened and I saw visions from God.\x + \xo 1:1: \xt Rev 19:11.\x*
\p
\v 2 That was the fifth year since King Yoyakin \add (Jehoiachin)\add* had been taken captive.\x + \xo 1:2: \xt 2Ki 24:10-16; 2Ch 36:9-10.\x*
\v 3 Yahweh’s message came to \add me\add*, the priest Yehezkel (son of Buzi) in the land of the Chaldeans \add (often known better as Babylonians)\add* by the Kevar Canal, and Yahweh \add revealed his strength to me\add* there.
\v 4 Then I looked, and there was a windstorm coming from the north—a huge cloud with \add lightning\add* flashing inside it and \add brilliant light\add* inside it and surrounding it, and fire inside the cloud \add made it appear as\add* an amber colour.
\v 5 In the middle \add was what seemed to be\add* four living creatures resembling humans,\x + \xo 1:5: \xt Rev 4:6.\x*
\v 6 \add but\add* each of them had four faces and four wings.
\v 7 Their legs were straight, but they had hooves like calves that gleamed like polished bronze.
\v 8 They had human hands under their wings on each of their four sides. For each of the four of them,
\v 9 their wings were touching the wings of the next creature, and they didn’t turn as they went—rather each one went straight forward.
\p
\v 10 Their faces \add at the front\add* were like a man’s face, then they each had a lion’s face on the right, a calf’s face on the left, and the fourth was an eagle’s face.\x + \xo 1:10: \xt Ezr 1:5,10; 10:4; Eze 10:14; Rev 4:7.\x*
\v 11 Their faces were like that, and their wings were spread out above, so that each creature had a pair of wings that touched another creature’s wing, and also a pair that covered their bodies.
\v 12 Each went straight forward, so that wherever the spirit directed them to go, they went without turning.
\p
\v 13 The living creatures \add resembled\add* burning coals \add or\add* torches. Bright fire also moved around among the creatures, and there were flashes of lightning.\x + \xo 1:13: \xt Rev 4:5.\x*
\v 14 The living creatures moved rapidly swiftly back and forth, and they \add looked a bit like\add* lightning.
\p
\v 15 Then I looked \add more closely\add* and then I saw a wheel on the ground beside each of the living creatures with its four faces.\x + \xo 1:15-21: \xt Eze 10:9-13.\x*
\v 16 \add Each of the wheels was the same, and they all shone like\add* chrysolite. \add Each wheel seemed to have one wheel inside the other\add* wheel.
\v 17 \add When\add* they moved, \add they didn’t have to turn to change direction\add*.
\v 18 The rims \add of the wheels\add* were \add awesomely tall\add*, and all four of them were full of eyes around the rim.\x + \xo 1:18: \xt Rev 4:8.\x*
\v 19 Whenever the living creatures moved, the wheels moved beside them. When the living creatures \add went upwards\add*, the wheels also went up.
\v 20 Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels went up beside them, because the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\v 21 Whenever the creatures moved, the wheels also moved, and when the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still. When the creatures \add went upwards\add*, the wheels went up beside them, because the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\p
\v 22 Above the living creatures was \add something like an awesome crystal dome stretched out over their heads\add*.\x + \xo 1:22: \xt Rev 4:6.\x*
\v 23 Beneath the dome, each of the creatures’ wings stretched out straight and touched another creature’s wings. Each \add one\add* also had a pair to cover his own body with.
\v 24 Then I heard the sound of their wings \add which was\add* like the noise of a lot of water. When they moved, it was like the voice of the powerful \add one\add*—like the sound of a rainstorm \add or\add* an army. Whenever they stood still, they lowered their wings.\x + \xo 1:24: \xt Rev 1:4-15; 19:6.\x*
\v 25 A voice came from under the dome that was above their heads, whenever they stopped and lowered their wings.
\s1 God’s throne
\p
\v 26 Above the dome over their heads was \add what looked like a sapphire stone that had been made into\add* a throne, and on the thing like a throne was a \add something that appeared to be\add* a man.\x + \xo 1:26: \xt Eze 10:1; Rev 4:2-3.\x*
\v 27 I saw a figure \add that appeared to have\add* glowing metal with fire in it from his hips upwards, and \add looking downwards from\add* his hips, I saw the appearance of fire and brightness all around.\x + \xo 1:27: \xt Eze 8:2.\x*
\v 28 The bright light surrounding \add the throne\add* was like the appearance of a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day—tt was the appearance of the likeness of Yahweh’s splendour. When I saw it, I \add quickly knelt down and bowed my head to the ground\add*, and I heard a voice speaking.
\c 2
\s1 Yehezkel sent as a prophet to Yisrael
\p
\v 1 He said to me, “Humanity’s child, stand up and then I’ll speak to you.”
\v 2 Then as he spoke to me, the spirit entered into me and \add stood me up\add*, and I heard him speaking to me.
\v 3 He told me, “Humanity’s child, I’m sending you to Yisra’el’s people—\add two\add* rebellious nations that have rebelled against me. Both they and their ancestors have been sinning against me \add right until this moment\add*.
\v 4 Their descendants \add are very stubborn and hard headed\add*. I’m sending you to them, and you’ll tell them that this is what the master Yahweh is saying to them.
\v 5 They might listen or might not. They’re a rebellious \add bunch\add*, but they’ll at least know that a prophet has been among them.
\p
\v 6 And you, humanity’s child, don’t be afraid of them or their words. Don’t be afraid, even though you’re with briers and thorns and although you live with scorpions. Don’t fear their words or be dismayed by their faces, since they’re a rebellious \add bunch\add*.
\v 7 \add Pass my\add* messages onto them, whether they listen or not, because they’re \add quite\add* rebellious.
\v 8 \add But\add* you, humanity’s child, listen to what I am telling you. Don’t become rebellious like that rebellious \add bunch\add*. Open your mouth and eat what I’m \add about to\add* give to you.”
\v 9 Then I looked and saw a hand extended out to me and \add it was holding a scroll with writing on it\add*.\x + \xo 2:9-10: \xt Rev 5:1.\x*
\v 10 He spread it out \add in front of\add* me—it had been written on both the front and the back, \add the contents were full of messages about grief, mourning, and sad endings\add*.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 He said to me, “Humanity’s child, what you’ve found, eat. Eat this scroll, then go speak to the \add Israeli people\add*.”\x + \xo 3:1-3: \xt Rev 10:9-10.\x*
\v 2 So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.
\p
\v 3 He told me, “Humanity’s child, feed your belly and fill your stomach with this scroll that I’ve given you.” So I ate it, and it \add tasted\add* as sweet as honey.
\p
\v 4 Then he told me, “Humanity’s child, go to the house of Yisrael \add (Israel)\add* and \add pass\add* my messages on to them
\v 5 because you aren’t being sent to a people \add who speak\add* a strange or difficult language, but to the \add Israeli people\add*—
\v 6 not to many peoples \add who speak\add* strange or difficult languages whose words you wouldn’t be able to understand. \add I’m sure that if it was them that\add* I sent you to, they would have listened to you.
\v 7 \add But\add* the \add Israeli people\add* won’t be willing to listen to you, because they’re not willing to listen to me. So all the \add Israeli people\add* are \add hard-headed\add* and hard-hearted.
\v 8 \add Listen, I’ll enable you to be as stubborn and tough as they are\add*.
\v 9 I’ll make \add you hard\add* like a diamond—harder than flint Don’t \add be scared by\add* them or discouraged by \add the looks they give you\add*, because they’re rebellious \add people\add*.”
\p
\v 10 He \add also\add* told me, “Humanity’s child, \add listen very carefully to what I say\add*, and \add keep thinking about it\add*.
\v 11 Then go to \add any of your people who were brought here as\add* captives, and tell them, ‘This is what the master Yahweh says,’ whether they’ll listen or not.”
\p
\v 12 Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard rumbling like a large earthquake behind me. (Blessed be Yahweh’s \add honour\add* in his place.)
\v 13 It was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels that were with them, and the sound of a large earthquake.
\v 14 Then the Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went with bitterness in my spirit’s rage, because Yahweh’s hand was pressing down firmly on me.
\v 15 Then I went to the captives at Tel-Abib who lived along the Kebar Canal, and I stayed among them there for seven days, overwhelmed in amazement.
\p
\v 16 \add After those seven days were over\add*, Yahweh \add gave\add* me this message:\f + \fr 3:16 \ft This formula occurs around fifty times in Ezekiel’s account.\f*
\v 17 “Humanity’s child, I’ve made you a \add guard over the Israeli people\add*, so listen to \add this message of mine\add* and give them my warning.
\v 18 When I tell the wicked, ‘You’ll certainly die’ and you don’t warn them \add about that\add* or give them a warning about their evil deeds so they might live—the wicked will die for their sin, but I’ll \add hold you responsible for their death\add*.
\v 19 \add But\add* if you do warn the wicked, and they don’t turn from their wickedness or from their wicked deeds, then they’ll die for their sin, but you will have saved your own life.
\p
\v 20 If a godly person turns from their righteousness and acts unjustly, and I set a stumbling block in front of that person, they will die. Because you did not warn them, they’ll die in their sin, and I won’t consider the righteous deeds that they performed, but I’ll \add hold you responsible for their death\add*.
\v 21 \add But\add* if you warn the godly person to stop sinning so that they no longer sin, \add that person\add* will surely live since they were warned; and you will have saved your own life.”
\s1 Yehezkel’s calling
\p
\v 22 Then Yahweh’s hand was on me there, and he told me, “\add Get ready\add* \add and\add* go out into the plain, and I’ll speak with you there.”
\p
\v 23 I \add got up\add* and went out into the plain where Yahweh’s glory was staying, like the glory that I had seen beside the Kebar Canal, so I fell \add to my knees and bowed low to the ground\add*.
\v 24 Then the spirit entered me and stood me up on my feet, and spoke with me, telling me: Go and shut yourself up in your house.
\v 25 Humanity’s child, \add people\add* will \add tie you up with ropes\add* so that you’ll be unable to go \add outside\add*.
\v 26 Then I’ll make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth, so you’ll become mute, and although they’re rebellious \add people\add*, you won’t be able to \add tell them off\add*.
\v 27 \add But\add* when I speak to you, I’ll open your mouth so you’ll be able to tell them, ‘This is what the master Yahweh says.’ The ones who will hear will hear \add but\add* the ones who won’t listen will not listen, because they’re a rebellious \add people\add*.

\ms1 Messages about Yerushalem’s destruction
\mr (4:1–24:27)
\s1 Yehezkel models Yerushalem’s invasion
\p
\v 1 But you, humanity’s child, get yourself a brick and place it \add in front of\add* you and carve Yerushalem City on it.
\v 2 Then lay siege against it, and build forts against it. \add Build\add* an assault ramp up against it and make camps around it. Place battering rams all around it.
\v 3 \add After that,\add* get yourself an iron pan and use it as an iron wall between yourself and \add your representation of\add* the city and \add keep looking in that direction\add*, because it will be under siege and you’re to put the siege against it. That will be a sign to the \add Israeli people\add*.
\p
\v 4 Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the house of Yisrael on it; you will carry their sin for the number of the days that you lie down against the house of Yisrael.
\v 5 I myself am assigning to you one day to represent each year of their punishment: 390 days \add lying on your left side\add*. In that way, you’ll carry the \add Israeli people’s\add* sin.
\v 6 When \add that period is over\add*, then lie down a second time on your right side, because you’ll carry the sin of \add Yehudah’s people\add* for forty days. I am assigning one day to you for each year.
\p
\v 7 \add Keep looking\add* towards Yerushalem that’s under siege, and with your arm bared \add like a warrior\add*, prophesy against it.
\v 8 \add Listen,\add* I’ll \add have you\add* tied with ropes so you won’t be able to turn from one side to the other until the days \add representing the years\add* of your siege are over.
\p
\v 9 Take wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt for yourself, \add and\add* put them into a single container and make bread for yourself according to the number of the days that you’ll lie upon your side—\add yes,\add* you’ll eat it for 390 days.
\v 10 You’ll measure 250g by weight to eat each day, and you’ll eat it during the day at set times.
\v 11 Then you’ll measure out half a litre of water to drink each day, and you’ll drink it at set times.
\v 12 You’ll \add cook and\add* eat \add that bread\add* as barley cakes, but \add burn sun-dried\add* human excrement to bake it over \add while they’re watching\add*.
\p
\v 13 Yahweh says that that means that the bread that the Israeli people will eat there among the \add other\add* nations that I’ll banish them to will be ceremonially unclean.
\v 14 \add But I protested\add*, “Oh no, master Yahweh. I’ve never \add broken our dietary laws\add*. I’ve never eaten either anything that died or anything killed by animals \add since I was young\add* until now, and foul meat has never entered my mouth.”
\p
\v 15 So \add Yahweh\add* \add answered\add* me, “Listen, I’ll give you cow manure instead of human excrement so you can \add bake\add* your bread over that.”
\p
\v 16 Then he told me, “Humanity’s child, listen. I’m breaking the \add cycle of food supply\add* in Yerushalem, and they’ll eat bread while rationing it in anxiety, and drink water while rationing it in trembling.
\v 17 \add because\add* they’ll lack \add both\add* food and water, and everyone will be appalled by \add the actions of\add* their \add neighbours\add* and they’ll waste away because they \add disobeyed\add* \add God\add*.
\c 5
\s1 Yehezkel’s Yerushalem model
\p
\v 1 Then you, humanity’s child, take a sharp sword as a barber’s razor for yourself, and \add use it to shave\add* your head and beard, then get \add some\add* scales \add so you can\add* weigh your hair and divide \add it\add* \add equally into three piles\add*.
\v 2 Burn a third of it in the middle of the city when the days of the siege are completed, and take \add the second pile\add* of hair and hit it with the sword all around the city. Then scatter \add the final\add* third to the wind, and I’ll draw out a sword to chase after the people.
\v 3 \add But\add* take a few hairs from them and tie them into the folds of your robe.
\v 4 Then take \add a bit\add* more of the hair and throw it into the middle of the fire \add to be burnt up\add*—from there a fire will spread out to all the \add Israeli people\add*.”
\p
\v 5 My master Yahweh says, “That \add brick model\add* is Yerushalem where I’ve placed her in the middle of the nations, and where I have surrounded her with other \add countries\add*.
\v 6 \add But due to her wickedness,\add* she’s rejected my decrees more than \add other\add* nations have, and \add avoided\add* my regulations more than the countries that surround her. Her people have rejected my judgements and haven’t \add followed\add* my regulations.”
\v 7 Therefore my master` Yahweh says this, “Because you are more troublesome than the nations that surround you, and haven’t \add followed\add* my statutes or acted according to my regulations, or even acted according to the decrees of the nations that surround you,”
\v 8 therefore my master Yahweh says this, “Listen, I myself will work against you. I’ll execute judgements in the middle of you for the \add other\add* nations to see.
\v 9 Because of your detestable actions, I’ll do things to you that I’ve never done before, and which I’ll never do again:
\v 10 Fathers will eat the children among you, and sons will eat their fathers, since I’ll execute judgement on you and scatter all of you who are left in every direction.\x + \xo 5:10: \xt Lam 4:10.\x*
\p
\v 11 This is my master Yahweh’s declaration: As I live, it’s certainly because you’ve defiled my sanctuary with all your hateful things and with all \add the disgusting things you’ve done\add*, that I myself will reduce you in number—\add I\add* won’t have pity on you, and I won’t spare you.
\v 12 A third of you will die by plague, plus they’ll be consumed by a famine \add that affects you\add*. A third will fall by the sword surrounding you. Then I’ll scatter a third in every direction, and draw out a sword to chase after them as well.
\p
\v 13 Then my \add rage will be over\add*, and I’ll \add relax\add* my fury at them. I’ll be satisfied, and they’ll know that I, Yahweh, have spoken in my rage \add and\add* I’ve completed my furious \add punishment\add* of them.
\v 14 I’ll make you into \add a city of ruins so that those from other nations will mock you as they\add* pass by.
\v 15 So Yerushalem will become something for other people to condemn and to mock—a warning and a horror to the nations that surround you. I’ll execute judgements against you in rage and fury, and with an angry rebuke. I, Yahweh have declared that.
\v 16 I’ll send out harsh arrows of famine against you that will become the means with which I will destroy you, because I’ll \add make the famine more severe and destroy your food supply\add*.
\v 17 I’ll send a famine and disasters against you so you’ll be childless. Plague and bloodshed will pass through you, and I will bring a sword against you. I, Yahweh, have declared that.\x + \xo 5:17: \xt Rev 6:8.\x*

\s1 Yahweh’s judgement on false gods
\p
\v 1 Yahweh message came to me, saying:
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, \add look towards\add* Yisra’el’s mountains and prophesy to them.
\v 3 Say, ‘Mountains of Yisra’el, listen to this message from the master Yahweh. My master Yahweh says this to the mountains and to the hills, to the streambeds, and to the valleys: Listen, I’m bringing a sword against you all, and I’ll destroy your \add hilltop shrines\add*.
\v 4 Then your altars will become desolate and your pillars will be destroyed, and I’ll throw your dead down in front of their idols.
\v 5 I’ll lay the dead bodies of Yisra’el’s people \add right there\add* \add in front of\add* their idols, and scatter your bones around your altars.
\v 6 Everywhere you all live, cities will be \add turned to rubble\add* and the \add hilltop shrines\add* ruined, so that your altars will be \add broken down and left idle\add*. Then they’ll be broken and disappear, your pillars will be cut down and \add everything you all have built\add* will be wiped away.
\v 7 The dead will fall down \add right there among you all\add* and you’ll know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 8 \add But\add* I’ll preserve a remnant among you, and there’ll be some who escape the sword among the nations, when you’re scattered throughout the countries.
\v 9 Then those who escape will think about me among the nations where they’ll be held captive. \add They’ll remember\add* that I was grieved by their promiscuous heart that turned away from me, and by their eyes that \add lusted\add* after their idols. Then the loathing for the wickedness that they’ve committed with all their \add disgusting activities\add* will show on their faces
\v 10 and they’ll know that I am Yahweh. It was for a reason that I said I’d bring this evil onto them.
\s1 Yahweh’s punishment of the Israelis
\p
\v 11 My master Yahweh says this: ‘Clap your hands and stamp your feet. Say, ‘Oh dear,’ because of all the \add disgustingly evil things done by the Israeli people\add*, because \add now\add* they’ll fall by sword, famine, and plague.
\v 12 \add Those who are far from\add* \add Yerushalem\add* will die by plague, and those who are near will fall by the sword. Those who remain and survive will die by famine. \add That’s the way that\add* I’ll put my fury against them \add into action\add*.
\v 13 Then you’ll know that I am Yahweh, when their dead lie among their idols, around their altars, on every high hill—on all the mountain peaks, and under every flourishing tree and thick oak—the places where they burned incense to all their idols.
\v 14 I’ll strike the land with my hand and make \add it bare and deserted\add* from the wilderness to Diblah, throughout all the places where they live. Then they’ll know that I am Yahweh.”
\c 7
\s1 Yisra’el’s end is coming
\p
\v 1 Yahweh’s message came to me, saying,
\v 2 “You, humanity’s child, the master Yahweh says this to the \add country\add* of Yisrael.”
\q1 ‘An end. An end has come to the four borders of the \add country\add*.
\p
\v 3 Now the end has come to you, because I’m sending out my rage onto you, and I’ll judge you according to your \add behaviour\add*,
\q1 then I will bring all your \add disgusting habits\add* \add back\add* upon you.
\v 4 \add I\add* won’t pity you, and I won’t spare you. Instead, I’ll bring your ways \add back\add* upon you,
\q1 and your \add disgusting actions will come back on you\add* so you’ll know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 5 My master Yahweh says this:
\q1 ‘Disaster. A unique disaster. Listen, it’s coming.
\v 6 An end \add of an era\add* is definitely coming. The end has woken up \add and is starting to work\add* against you—\add yes\add* it’s coming.
\v 7 Your doom is coming to you who inhabit the land. The time has come. The day of destruction is near, and the mountains will no longer be cheerful.
\p
\v 8 Now before long I’ll pour out my fury against you and fill up my rage upon you when I judge you according to your ways and bring all your \add disgusting actions\add* \add back\add* on you
\v 9 because \add I\add* won’t look compassionately and I won’t spare you. \add Whatever you’ve done\add* \add in the past\add*, I’ll do to you \add now\add*, and your \add disgusting actions\add* will \add bounce back on you\add* so you’ll know that I it’s me, Yahweh, who’s punishing you.
\v 10 Look here, the day—\add yes\add*, it’s coming. Doom has gone out. The rod has blossomed. Arrogance has budded.
\v 11 Violence has grown up into a rod of wickedness, \add but\add* none of them \add (even though there’s many of them)\add*, and none of their wealth, and none of their importance will continue.
\p
\v 12 The time is coming—the day has come close. Don’t let a buyer be happy or any seller be sad, because my anger is \add directed at the entire large group\add*.
\v 13 \add No,\add* the seller won’t return to the land he sold as long as they both live, because the vision concerning the entire group won’t be reversed, and because of their \add disobedience\add*, none of them will be \add able to save themselves\add*.
\v 14 They’ve blown the trumpet and gotten everything ready, but there’s no one marching to battle because since my anger is on the entire large group.
\p
\v 15 The sword is on the outside, and plague and famine are inside the building. Those who are in the countryside will die by the sword, while famine and plague will consume those in the city.
\v 16 But some survivors will escape from among them, and will go up into the hills. Like the doves \add that live in\add* the valleys, all of them will moan—each man for his \add own\add* disobedience.
\v 17 \add They won’t be able to use their trembling hands\add* and \add their knees will feel like liquid\add*.
\v 18 They’ll wear sackcloth, \add but will be covered in\add* terror. \add Their faces will display their shame, and they’ll shave their heads\add* \add as a sign of sorrow\add*.
\v 19 They’ll throw their silver into the streets and their gold will be like rubbish. Their silver and their gold won’t be able to rescue them in the day of Yahweh’s rage. Their lives won’t be saved, and their hunger will not be satisfied, because their \add disobedience\add* has become a stumbling block.
\v 20 In their pride they had take his beautiful jewelled ornaments and made them into their idolatrous figures and their detestable things. Therefore, I’m going to defile those things.
\v 21 I’ll hand those things over to strangers as plunder and to the wicked of the earth as plunder, and they’ll defile them.
\v 22 Then I’ll \add put my hand over my eyes\add* when they defile my cherished place—bandits will enter it and defile it.
\p
\v 23 Make a chain, because the \add country\add* is filled with judgement \add for those who’d been killed\add*, and \add now\add* the city is full of violence.
\v 24 I’ll bring the most wicked of the nations \add here\add*, and they’ll \add take over\add* \add the people’s\add* houses, and I’ll bring the pride of the powerful \add people\add* to an end because their sacred places will be defiled.
\v 25 Anguish will \add be the order of the day\add* and they’ll \add wish for peace, but there won’t be any\add*.
\v 26 Disaster \add will follow\add* disaster and there’ll be rumour after rumour. Then they’ll \add be wanting\add* a vision from the prophet, but the priest will \add no longer teach\add* \add God’s\add* \add instructions\add* and advice from the elders \add will be useless\add*.
\v 27 The king will mourn and the prince will \add be overcome by\add* despair, while the hands of the country’s people will tremble in fear. \add I’ll do that do them just like they did to others\add*. I’ll judge them by their own standards until they know that I am Yahweh.

\ms1 Yahweh’s second revelation to Yehezkel (8:1–10:22)
\s1 Yerushalem’s disgusting idol worship
\p
\v 1 Then in \add the middle of\add* the sixth year\f + \fr 8:1 \ft About fourteen months later—around mid-September 592 B.C.\f* as I sat in my house and Yehudah’s elders sat \add in front of\add* me, my master Yahweh’s hands fell upon me there again.
\v 2 I looked, and wow—there was \add something that looked a bit like\add* a man. From the appearance of his hips downward there was fire, and from his hips upward there was the appearance of something shining like glowing metal.\x + \xo 8:2: \xt Eze 1:27.\x*
\v 3 Then he reached out the form of a hand and took me by my hair—the Spirit lifted me up between earth and the heavens, and in visions from God, he took me to Yerushalem, to the entrance of the inner northern gate where the idol was that made \add Yahweh\add* very \add jealous\add*.
\p
\v 4 Then wow, the \add brilliant light\add* of Yisra’el’s God was there, just like the vision that I’d seen on the plain.\x + \xo 8:4: \xt Eze 1:28.\x*
\v 5 Then he told me, “Humanity’s child, \add look towards\add* the north.” \add So\add* I \add looked towards\add* the north and to the north of the gate leading to the altar—there in the entrance, was the idol \add that caused the\add* jealousy.
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* he told me, “Humanity’s child, do you see what they’re doing? Those are \add horribly disgusting things\add* that the \add Israeli people\add* are doing here to \add drive\add* me far from my own sanctuary. \add But\add* you’ll see even more disgusting \add things\add* \add soon\add*.”
\p
\v 7 Then he took me to the courtyard doorway, and I looked and \add was\add* a hole in the wall.
\v 8 He told me, “Humanity’s child, dig into this wall.” So I dug into the wall, and \add discovered\add* a doorway.
\v 9 Then he told me, “Go and see the \add disgustingly wicked things\add* that they’re doing there.”
\v 10 \add So\add* I went through and looked, and oh dear, there was every form of creeping thing and detestable creature. \add Drawings of\add* every idol from the \add Israeli people\add* were carved into the wall all around.
\v 11 Seventy elders from the \add Israeli people\add* were there, and Shafan’s son Yaazanyah was standing in the middle of them. They were standing in front of the images, and each man \add was holding\add* his incense burner so that the smell of the cloud of incense went up.
\v 12 Then he \add asked\add* me, “Humanity’s child, do you see what the \add Israeli\add* elders are doing in the dark? Each one does this in the hidden chamber of his idol, because they say, ‘Yahweh doesn’t \add even\add* \add notice\add* us. Yahweh has \add abandoned this country\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 13 Then he told me, “Turn again and see the other \add terribly disgusting things\add* that they’re doing,”
\v 14 and he took me to the gate at the northern entrance of Yahweh’s, and oh dear—there were some women sitting there mourning for the \add Babylonian\add* Tammuz \add deity\add*.
\v 15 Then he said to me, “Humanity’s child, do you see that? Turn again, and you’ll see even \add more disgusting things\add* than those.”
\p
\v 16 Then he took me into the inner courtyard of Yahweh’s house, and oh no—at the entrance of Yahweh’s temple between the portico and the altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs toward the temple and their faces toward the east \add where\add* they were worshipping the sun.
\p
\v 17 He \add asked\add* me, “Humanity’s child, do you see that? Is it a little thing for the \add people\add* of Yehudah to do those \add disgusting things\add* that they’re doing here? They’ve filled the land with violence and have turned again to provoke me to anger and \add to make mockery of me\add*.
\v 18 \add So\add* I will also act among them—\add I\add* won’t have compassion and I won’t spare them. Even if they cry loudly in my ears, I won’t hear them.”
\c 9
\s1 Yehezkel is shown Yerushalem’s coming punishment
\p
\v 1 Then \add I heard\add* \add Yahweh\add* call out with a loud voice, saying, “Let the guards come up to the city, each \add one carrying his destructive\add* weapon.”
\v 2 Then wow, six men came out from the pathway of the upper gate that faces north, each \add carrying\add* his weapon of slaughter. There was a man \add among them\add* dressed in linen with a writer’s equipment at his side. Then they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.
\p
\v 3 Then the \add bright light representing\add* Yisrael’s God went from the winged creature where it had been, up to the threshold of the house. \add Yahweh\add* called to the man dressed in linen who had the \add writing\add* equipment at his side.
\v 4 Yahweh told him, “Go through the middle of Yerushalem City, and make a mark on the foreheads of those who complain and despair about all the \add disgusting things being done\add* \add there\add* in the middle of the city.”\x + \xo 9:4: \xt Rev 7:1-8; 9:4; 14:1.\x*
\p
\v 5 Then he spoke to the others within my hearing, “Go through the city after him and kill. Don’t let \add yourselves\add* have compassion, and don’t show any pity.
\v 6 Slaughter all the old men, young men and women, little children and women, \add but\add* don’t approach anyone who has the mark on their head. Begin at my \add sacred place\add*.” So they began with the elders who were in front of the \add temple\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add Yahweh\add* told them, “Defile the \add temple\add*, and fill its courtyards with the dead. \add Now go\add*.” So they went out and \add started\add* attacking the city.
\p
\v 8 As they were attacking it, I found myself alone and I fell \add to my knees with my head bowed down to the ground\add* and cried out and said, “Ah, master Yahweh, will you destroy the entire remnant of Yisrael in the outpouring of your rage on Yerushalem?”
\p
\v 9 “The disobedience of the \add people\add* of Yisrael and Yehudah has been \add extremely bad\add*,” he answered. “The land is full of blood and the city full of perversions, since they say, ‘Yahweh has forgotten \add this country\add*,’ and ‘Yahweh won’t \add take any notice\add*.’
\v 10 So then, \add I won’t show\add* compassion, and I won’t spare them, rather I’ll bring it all on their heads.”
\p
\v 11 Then wow, the man dressed in linen who had the writing equipment by his side came back to report, saying, “I’ve done everything you commanded.”
\c 10
\s1 God’s splendour leaves the temple
\p
\v 1 As I looked toward the dome that was over the heads of the winged creatures, something appeared above them \add that looked like a sapphire stone that had been made into\add* a throne.\x + \xo 10:1: \xt Eze 1:26; Rev 4:2.\x*
\v 2 Then Yahweh spoke to the man dressed in linen and said, “Go between the wheels underneath the winged creatures, and fill both your hands with fiery coals from between the winged creatures and scatter them over the city.”\x + \xo 10:2: \xt Rev 8:5.\x*
\p Then the man went in as I watched.
\v 3 The winged creatures stood on the right side of the \add temple\add* when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner courtyard.
\v 4 Yahweh’s \add brilliant light\add* rose up from the winged creature and stood over the threshold of the house. It filled the house with the cloud, and the courtyard was full of the brightness of Yahweh’s splendour.
\v 5 The sound of the creatures’ wings could be heard as far as the outer courtyard, like the voice of the powerful God when he speaks.
\p
\v 6 When \add Yahweh\add* had commanded the man dressed in linen, “Take fire from between the wheels that are between the winged creatures,” the man went in and stood beside a wheel.
\v 7 A winged creature reached out his hand between the winged creatures to the fire that was among \add them\add*, and lifted it up and placed it into the hands of the one dressed in linen. The man took it and went back out.
\p
\v 8 I \add noticed\add* that the winged creatures had something like a human hand under their wings,
\v 9 then I looked, and wow, four wheels were beside the winged creatures—one wheel beside each \add one\add*—and the wheels seemed like shining chrysolite.\x + \xo 10:9-13: \xt Eze 1:15-21.\x*
\v 10 \add They\add* all appeared to be the same, like having a wheel within a wheel.
\v 11 When they moved, they went in any of their four directions, without turning as they went, because whatever direction the head faced, they went in that direction without turning as they went.
\v 12 Their whole body (including their backs, their hands, and their wings) was covered with eyes, and eyes covered all around the four wheels as well.\x + \xo 10:12: \xt Rev 4:8.\x*
\v 13 I heard \add someone\add* call them ‘the whirling wheels’.
\p
\v 14 Each one had four faces: the first face was the face of a winged creature, the second was a man’s face, the third was a lion’s face, and the fourth was an eagle’s face.\x + \xo 10:14: \xt Eze 1:10; Rev 4:7.\x*
\v 15 Then the living creatures (they were the same ones that I had seen by the Kebar channel) rose up \add in the air\add*.
\v 16 Whenever the winged creatures moved, the wheels would go beside them, and whenever the winged creatures lifted up their wings to go up from the earth, the wheels didn’t turn—they still stayed beside them.
\v 17 When the winged creatures stood still, the wheels stood still, and when they went up, the wheels went up with them, because the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
\p
\v 18 Then Yahweh’s \add brilliant light\add* went out over the \add temple\add* threshold and stayed over the winged creatures.
\v 19 The winged creatures lifted up their wings and rose from the ground in my sight when they went out, and the wheels did the same beside them. They stood at the eastern entrance to Yahweh’s residence, and the \add brilliant light\add* of Yisrael’s God came onto them from above.
\v 20 Those were the living creatures that I had seen below the Yisrael’s God by the Kebar Canal, so I knew that they were winged creatures.
\p
\v 21 They each had four faces and four wings, and had something like human hands under their wings,
\v 22 and their faces \add resembled\add* the faces that I’d seen in the vision at the Kebar Canal, and each of them went straight ahead.
\c 11
\s1 Yahweh’s punishment for Yerushalem
\p
\v 1 Then the spirit lifted me up and brought me to the eastern gate of Yahweh’s \add temple\add*, facing east, and behold, in the doorway of the gate there were twenty-five men. Among them I saw Azzur’s son Yaazanyah and Benayah’s son Felatyah \add who were\add* leaders of the people.
\p
\v 2 \add Yahweh\add* told me, “Humanity’s child, these are the men who \add plan to do evil things\add* and who make wicked plans in this city.
\v 3 They’re saying, ‘\add This isn’t yet\add* the time to build houses. This city is \add like a cooking\add* pot, and we’re the meat.’
\v 4 So, prophesy against them, humanity’s child, \add start\add* prophesying.”
\p
\v 5 Then Yahweh’s spirit came on me and told me to say: This is what Yahweh says, “That is what you’re all saying, \add people\add* of Yisrael, because I know what goes through your mind.
\v 6 You’ve killed \add many people\add* in this city, and filled its streets with them.
\p
\v 7 Therefore the master Yahweh says: The people you’ve killed, whose bodies you have laid in the middle of Yerushalem, are the meat, and this city is the pot. But you’re all going to be brought out from the centre of this city.
\v 8 You’ve feared the sword, so I am bringing the sword upon you. That’s my master Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 9 I’ll bring you out from the city, and put you into the hands of foreigners, because I’ll bring judgement against you all.
\v 10 You’ll all fall by the sword. I will judge you within Yisrael’s border so that you’ll all know that I am Yahweh.
\v 11 This city won’t be your cooking pot, nor will you be the meat within her. I’ll judge you all within Yisrael’s borders.
\v 12 Then you’ll all know that I’m Yahweh, the one whose instructions you haven’t \add obeyed\add* and whose regulations you haven’t \add followed\add*. Instead, you all have \add imitated\add* the \add wicked\add* \add ways\add* of the nations that surround you.”
\p
\v 13 Then as I was prophesying, Benayah’s son Felatyah died. \add So\add* I fell \add to my knees with my face bowed low to the ground\add* and cried out with a loud voice, “Oh no, my master Yahweh, will you completely \add eliminate the Israeli people\add*?”
\s1 Yahweh’s promise to the exiles
\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh \add gave me this\add* message:
\v 15 “Your brothers, humanity’s child, your brothers and all the \add Israeli people who were exiled\add*. The ones living in Yerushalem say about them all, ‘They’re far away from Yahweh. \em This land\em* was given to us as \add ours to own\add*.’
\p
\v 16 So tell \add them\add*, ‘My master Yahweh says this: ‘Although I’ve removed them far away \add to other\add* nations, and though I have scattered them among \add those\add* lands, yet I have been a \add place of security\add* for them for a little while in the lands where they \add were taken\add*.’
\p
\v 17 So \add explain\add* \add to them\add*, ‘My master Yahweh says this: ‘I’ll gather you from the peoples, and assemble you from the lands where you were scattered, and I’ll give you \add back\add* the \add country\add* of Yisrael.’
\v 18 Then they’ll go there and remove every detestable and disgusting thing from there,
\v 19 and I’ll give them one heart, and I’ll put a new spirit within them. I’ll take the heart of stone ouf of \add them\add* and give them \add tender hearts\add*,\x + \xo 11:19-20: \xt Eze 36:26-28.\x*
\v 20 so that they’ll \add follow my instructions and obey my regulations\add*. Then they’ll be my people, and I’ll be their God.
\v 21 \add But\add* to those who \add would rather happily choose\add* their detestable and disgusting ways, I’ll \add make their actions bounce back\add* onto their own heads. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.”
\s1 God’s glory leaves Yerushalem
\p
\v 22 Then the winged creatures lifted up their wings and the wheels that were beside them, and the \add brilliant light\add* of Yisrael’s God was up high over them.\x + \xo 11:22-23: \xt Eze 43:2-5.\x*
\v 23 Then \add it\add* went up from the centre of the city and \add sat above\add* the mountain to the east of the city.
\v 24 The spirit lifted me up and brought me into Chaldea \add (Babylonia)\add* to the exiles, in the vision from the God’s spirit, and the vision that I’d been seeing left me,
\v 25 and I told the exiles everything Yahweh had shown me.
\c 12
\s1 Portraying the future exile
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave me this\add* message:
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, you live among a rebellious \add people\add* who have eyes to see yet they don’t see, and who have ears to hear but don’t listen, because they’re a rebellious \add people\add*.\x + \xo 12:2: \xt Isa 6:9-10; Jer 5:21; Mrk 8:18.\x*
\p
\v 3 Therefore, humanity’s child, \add pack up your stuff ready to go into\add* exile, and \add each day while they’re watching\add*, start going out \add somewhere\add*, because \add while they’re watching\add*, I’ll exile you from your place to another place. Perhaps they’ll begin to see, even though they’re \add such\add* rebellious \add people\add*.
\v 4 \add Each day while they’re watching,\add* bring out your things for an exile, \add then\add* as they watch in the evening, go out in the way that \add people do\add* when going into exile.
\v 5 Dig a hole through the \add city\add* wall in their sight, and go out through it.
\v 6 \add While they’re watching\add*, lift your things up onto your shoulder, and bring them out in the darkness. Cover your face, because you mustn’t see \add this\add* land, since I’ve \add made you into\add* a sign for the \add Israeli people\add*.”
\p
\v 7 So I did just as I was instructed: I brought my things of exile out in the daytime, and in the evening I dug a hole through the wall by hand. I brought my things out in the dark, and lifted them up onto my shoulder \add as they looked on\add*.
\rem Need to make next verse style consistent throughout the document: Yahweh GAVE ME a message, vs Yahweh’s message CAME TO ME.
\p
\v 8 The \add next\add* morning, Yahweh \add gave me this\add* message:
\v 9 “Humanity’s child, haven’t those rebellious \add Israeli people\add* asked you what you’re doing?
\v 10 Tell them that the master Yahweh says this: ‘this prophetic action concerns the ruler in Yerushalem and all the \add other\add* \add Israeli people\add* who are there.’
\v 11 Tell them that you’re a sign to them, and that everything you’ve done will happen to them—they’ll be \add captured and taken into exile\add* \add into another country\add*.
\v 12 \add Their leader\add* will lift his things up onto his shoulder in the dark, and will go out through the wall. They’ll dig through the wall and take their things out. He’ll cover his face, so he won’t see the \add place\add* \add he’s leaving\add* with his eyes.
\v 13 I’ll spread my net out over him and he’ll be caught in my trap, then I’ll take him \add away\add* to Babylon (the land of the Chaldeans) but he won’t see it and he’ll die there.\x + \xo 12:13: \xt 2Ki 25:7; Jer 52:11.\x*
\v 14 I’ll also scatter all of his assistants in every direction, and I’ll send out a sword after his entire army.
\v 15 When I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the lands, then they’ll know that I am Yahweh.
\v 16 \add But\add* I’ll spare a few men from among them from the sword, famine, and plague, so they’ll be able to record all their \add hardships and ungodly practices\add* in the \add countries\add* that I take them to, so they’ll know that I am Yahweh.”
\s1 Portraying the peoples’ trembling
\p
\v 17 Then Yahweh \add gave me\add* \add another\add* message:
\v 18 “Humanity’s child, eat your food with trembling, and drink your water with shaking and worry,
\v 19 and tell the people in \add this country\add*, ‘My master Yahweh says this about the inhabitants of Yerushalem, and the \add country\add* of Yisrael, “They will eat their food with trembling and drink their water while shaking, since \add all the abundance from the land will be devastated\add* because of the violence of all those who live there.
\v 20 The inhabited cities will become desolate, and the land \add itself\add* will become a wasteland. Then you will know that I am Yahweh.” ’ ”
\s1 Just because it never came true before…
\p
\v 21 Then Yahweh \add gave me\add* \add another\add* message:
\v 22 “Humanity’s child, what’s the saying that you have in Yisrael that goes, ‘The days \add seem to go on and on, yet no prophecy ever comes true\add*’?
\v 23 So tell them, ‘This is what the master Yahweh says: I’m going to prove that what they say isn’t correct, then they’ll never say it again in Yisrael.’ Tell them, ‘It’ll soon be the time when everything that the prophets have predicted will happen,
\v 24 because there’ll no longer be any false visions or \add people-pleasing prophecies\add* within Yisrael.
\v 25 I speak, and I \add put the words that I speak into action\add*, because I am Yahweh. The matter will no longer be delayed, because I’ll speak this message in your \add lifetimes\add*, \add you\add* rebellious \add people\add*, and then I’ll carry it out!’ That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.”
\p
\v 26 Then Yahweh \add gave me\add* \add another\add* message:
\v 27 “Listen, humanity’s child, the \add Israeli people\add* have said, ‘The vision that \add the prophet\add* sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of far off times,’
\v 28 so tell them, ‘The master Yahweh says this: ‘My words won’t be delayed any longer, but the message that I’ve given will be \add put into effect\add*. That is the master Yahwehs declaration.’ ”
\c 13
\s1 Condemning the false prophets
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave me\add* \add another\add* message:
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, prophesy against the prophets who are prophesying in Yisrael, and tell those who are prophesying out of their own imaginations, ‘Listen to Yahweh’s message.
\v 3 My master Yahweh says this: ‘Foolish prophets who follow their own spirit and haven’t \add actually\add* seen any \add vision\add* \add won’t end well\add*.
\v 4 Yisrael, your prophets have been like jackals in the wastelands.
\v 5 You haven’t gone to the breaks in the \add walls\add* around the Israeli \add cities\add* and repaired them, in order to \add be able to defend yourselves well during\add* the battle on Yahweh’s \add chosen\add* day.
\v 6 The people have false visions and make false predictions. Yahweh hasn’t sent those who say that they’re bringing Yahweh’s declaration, \add but nevertheless they’ve made people hope that their messages would come true\add*.
\v 7 Haven’t you had false visions and made false predictions—all of you who say that you’re bringing Yahweh’s declaration when I myself haven’t spoken?’
\p
\v 8 Therefore the master Yahweh says this, ‘Because you all have \add presented\add* false visions and have told lies—therefore this is the master Yahweh’s declaration against you:
\v 9 \add I’ll punish\add* the prophets who have lying visions and who make false predictions. They won’t be \add allowed\add* in the assembly of my people, or enrolled in the record of the \add descendants\add* of Yisrael. They mustn’t go to the land of Yisrael—\add that’s how\add* you’ll all know that I am the master Yahweh.
\p
\v 10 Also because they led my people astray and said, “Peace,” when there’s no peace, \add it’s as if\add* they’re building a wall and then whitewashing it.’\x + \xo 13:10: \xt Jer 6:14; 8:11.\x*
\v 11 Tell the ones who are whitewashing the wall that it’ll fall down. There’ll be a downpour, then I’ll send hailstones to make it fall down, and a strong wind to break it down.
\v 12 See, the wall will fall down. Haven’t others \add asked\add* you where the white coating \add went\add* that you put on it?
\p
\v 13 Therefore my master Yahweh says this: ‘In my rage, I’ll bring a storm, and in my anger, there’ll be \add heavy rain causing floods\add*. In my rage, hailstones will completely destroy \add Yerushalem\add*.
\v 14 I’ll tear down the wall that you covered with whitewash, and I’ll demolish it to ground level and expose its foundations. So it will fall, and you’ll be annihilated in the middle of it all. Then you all will know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 15 In my rage I’ll annihilate the wall and those who whitewashed it. I’ll tell you, “The wall doesn’t exist anymore, nor do the people who whitewashed it—
\v 16 those Israeli prophets who prophesied about Yerushalem and had visions of peace for her. But there isn’t any peace! That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.” ’
\p
\v 17 \add So\add* humanity’s child, \add turn your attention to\add* the daughters of your people and prophesy against them \add because they invented prophecies in their own imaginations\add*.
\v 18 Tell \add them\add* that the master Yahweh says this: ‘The women \add won’t end well\add* who sew magic charms onto every part of their hands, and make headbands for people of \add every walk of life\add* \add that are used to deceive and\add* hunt down people. \add Do you all \add really\add* think you can get away with\add* hunting down my people but then save your own lives?
\v 19 You have profaned me among my people for handfuls of barley and crumbs of bread. \add You’ve all\add* killed people who shouldn’t have died, and saved the lives of those who shouldn’t have continued to live, because of your lies to my people who heard you.
\p
\v 20 Therefore my master Yahweh says this: ‘I’m against the magic charms that you have used to \add suck\add* the people in as if they were birds. Indeed, I’ll tear them from your arms and I’ll let the people you’ve trapped like birds go free.
\v 21 I’ll tear away your headbands and rescue my people from your \add control\add* so they’ll no longer be trapped in your \add system\add*. Then you’ll all know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 22 Because you’ve discouraged the righteous people with lies (even though I didn’t desire their discouragement), and because you all \add encouraged the actions\add* of the wicked people instead so they won’t turn from their way to save his life,
\v 23 then you’ll all no longer have false visions or continue to make predictions, because I’ll rescue my people out of your \add control\add*. Then you all will know that I am Yahweh.’ ”
\c 14
\s1 Yahweh’s hate for idols
\p
\v 1 \add One day\add* \add some\add* of the Israeli elders came and sat down \add to talk\add*,
\v 2 and Yahweh \add gave\add* me this message:
\v 3 “Humanity’s child, these men have taken their idols \add to be their god\add* and \add their choice to disobey makes it very difficult for them to relate to me\add*. Should I \add even let them ask me anything\add*?
\p
\v 4 Therefore tell them that the master Yahweh says this: ‘Every Israeli man who \add makes his idols his priority\add*, or who \add allows his disobedience to separate him from me\add*, and who then comes to a prophet, I, Yahweh, will answer him according to \add how many idols he has\add*.
\v 5 I’ll do that so that I can \add reclaim the Israeli people whose values are now far from mine due to\add* their idols.
\p
\v 6 Therefore tell the Israeli people that the master Yahweh says this: ‘\add Change your behaviour\add* and turn away from your idols. \add Make a decision to stop disobeying me by doing those evil things\add*.
\p
\v 7 Any \add Israeli person\add* and any foreigner residing in Yisrael who deserts me, who takes idols \add to be their god\add* and \add allows their disobedience to separate them from me\add*, and who then comes to a prophet to \add request my guidance\add*, I, Yahweh, will answer that person myself.
\v 8 I’ll \add clearly show my disapproval\add* and make that person into a sign \add for others\add* and into a \add talking point\add* and they’ll be \add isolated from the rest of\add* my people, and you all will know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 9 If a prophet is deceived and speaks a message, then I, Yahweh, will deceive that prophet. I’ll \add take action\add* against him and destroy him \add to remove him\add* from among the Israeli people.
\v 10 \add Both the prophet and the one who asks him for advice will be guilty, and I will punish both of them for their disobedience.\add*
\v 11 Because of that, the Israeli people will no longer wander away from following me, nor defile themselves any longer through all their \add disobedience\add*. They’ll be my people, and I’ll be their God. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.’ ”
\s1 Turning the country into wasteland
\p
\v 12 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 13 “Humanity’s child, when a \add country\add* sins against me by \add choosing to worship other gods\add*, so that I \add decide to take action\add* against it, \add then\add* I’ll break the \add cycle of food production\add* and send a famine out over it. I’ll \add punish\add* both people and animals from that land
\v 14 \add in such a way that\add* even if Noah, Daniel, and Yob \add (Job)\add* \add lived in that place\add*, they could only rescue their own lives by their being \add blameless in my sight\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p
\v 15 If I send \add vicious wild animals\add* through the \add country\add* and make it barren so that it becomes a wasteland where no one can may pass through because of those animals,
\v 16 then even if those same three men were in it, as I live declares the master Yahweh, they wouldn’t be able to rescue even their own \add children\add*—only their own lives would be saved, but the land \add itself\add* would become a wasteland.
\p
\v 17 Or if I bring a sword against that \add country\add* and say, ‘Sword, go through the land and \add eliminate both the\add* people and \add domestic\add* animals from it’,
\v 18 then even if those three men were in it, as I live, declares the master Yahweh, they wouldn’t be able to rescue even their own sons or daughters—only their own lives would be saved.
\p
\v 19 Or if I send a plague against that \add country\add* and pour out my rage against it through bloodshed, in order to \add eliminate both the\add* people and the \add domestic\add* animals,
\v 20 as surely as I live, even if Noah, Daniel and Yob \add (Job)\add* were in that country, they wouldn’t be able to rescue even their sons and daughters. They would save only themselves because of their being \add blameless in my sight\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p
\v 21 The master Yahweh says this: ‘I will certainly make things worse by sending my four punishments against Yerushalem to \add eliminate both the\add* people and the \add domestic\add* animals from it: famine, sword, wild animals, and plague.\x + \xo 14:21: \xt Rev 6:8.\x*
\v 22 \add But listen!\add* \add Despite that,\add* a remnant will be left in \add the city\add*—survivors who will go out with sons and daughters. \add Yes,\add* they’ll go out to you, and you’ll see their ways and actions and \add understand why they deserved\add* the punishment that I sent to Yerushalem, and about everything else that I have sent against the \add country\add*.
\v 23 The survivors will relieve you all when you see their ways and their actions, because you’ll know that all those things that I’ve done against her, I \add didn’t do them without good reason\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.”
\c 15
\s1 The vine stem is useless as wood
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, how is a vine better than any tree with branches that is among the trees in a forest?
\v 3 Do people take wood from \add a vine\add* to make anything? Would anyone make a peg from \add the wood of a vine\add* to hang anything on it?
\v 4 If it’s \add used as firewood\add*, and if the fire has burnt both ends and even the middle, is it good \add wood, or indeed good\add* for anything?
\v 5 \add Originally,\add* \add the wood of the vine\add* couldn’t \add be used to\add* make anything, surely then, when the fire has burnt it, it still can’t do anything useful.
\p
\v 6 Therefore the master Yahweh says this: ‘Unlike the trees in the forests, I’ve given the vine as fuel for fires. I will act in the same way toward Yerushalem’s inhabitants
\v 7 and I’ll \add start to take action\add* against them. Even if they get out of the fire, the fire will still consume them, so you’ll all know that I am Yahweh, when I \add take action\add* against them.
\v 8 Then I’ll make the land into an abandoned wasteland because they \add chose to worship other gods\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.”
\c 16
\s1 Unfaithful Yerushalem’s vile practices
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, inform Yerushalem about \add their detestable behaviour\add*,
\v 3 and declare that the master Yahweh says this to Yerushalem: Your beginning and your birth took place in the land of Canaan, your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite.\f + \fr 16:3 \ft A bunch of insults to the proud Israelis.\f*
\v 4 \add When you were born\add*, your mother didn’t cut your cord, nor did she clean you with water or rub you down with salt, or wrap cloth around you.
\v 5 No \add one cared enough\add* for you to do any of these things for you—to be compassionate toward you. Your life \add was despised\add* \add and\add* you were thrown out into the open field on the \add very\add* day that you were born.
\p
\v 6 But I went past, and I saw you, \add Yerushalem,\add* writhing in your own blood, so I said to you \add as you lay there\add* in your blood, “Live!”\f + \fr 16:6 \ft The last part of the verse is repeated in the Hebrew.\f*
\v 7 I made you grow like a plant in the countryside. You grew up and became tall, and you became the jewel of jewels. Your breasts became firm, and your hair grew thick, even though you had been naked and bare.
\p
\v 8 I went past again and saw you. Wow, the time of love came for you, so I spread my robe out over you and covered your nakedness. Then I \add made a promise\add* to you and brought you into a contract and you became mine. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p
\v 9 I washed you, \add Yerushalem,\add* with water and rinsed your blood off you, and I \add put lotion on your skin\add*.
\v 10 Then I dressed you in embroidered clothes and put leather sandals on your feet. I wrapped you with fine linen then covered you with silk.
\v 11 Next I adorned you with jewellery, and I put bracelets on your hands and a chain around your neck.
\v 12 I put a ring in your nose and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.
\v 13 So you were adorned with gold and silver, and you were dressed in fine linen, silk, and embroidered clothes. You ate fine flour, honey, and oil, and you were very beautiful, and you became a queen.
\v 14 Your \add reputation\add*, \add Yerushalem,\add* \add spread\add* among the nations because of your beauty, because it was perfect in the majesty that I had given to you. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p
\v 15 But \add Yerushalem,\add* you trusted in your own beauty, and you acted like a prostitute because of your reputation. You \add flirted with everyone going past and prostituted yourself\add*, so that your beauty became theirs.
\v 16 Then you took your clothes and made \add hilltop shrines\add* for yourself with them, decorated in various colours, and there you acted like a prostitute. This shouldn’t have happened, nor should such a thing exist.
\v 17 You took the fine gold and silver jewellery that I gave you, and you made male figures for yourselves, and you \add behaved with them like a prostitute would do\add*.
\v 18 You took your embroidered garments and covered \add those idols\add*, and you \add offered\add* my oils and perfumes to them.
\v 19 The \add high-quality\add* bread that I gave you (made with fine flour, oil, and honey), you placed \add in front of\add* them to be a fragrant aroma \add and indeed it was\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p
\v 20 Then you took your sons and daughters that you bore for me, and you sacrificed them to \add those idols\add* to be devoured as food. Are your acts of prostitution a small matter?
\v 21 You slaughtered my children for the idols and made them pass through the fire.
\v 22 In all your \add evil goings on\add* and your acts of prostitution, you \add never remembered back to\add* the days of your youth, when you were naked and bare as you thrashed about in your \add own\add* blood.
\v 23 After all your wickedness, \add you won’t end well\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\s1 The anger of God on Yerushalem
\p
\v 24 You made yourself a mound and built a raised shrine in every public square.
\v 25 You built your raised platform at the top of every street and made your beauty a disgrace, and you spread your legs for anyone who passed by, and you multiplied your acts of prostitution.
\v 26 You have acted like a prostitute with your lusty neighbours the Egyptians, and you committed many more acts of prostitution, provoking me to anger.
\p
\v 27 Listen, I’ll hit you with my hand and cut off your food \add supply\add*. I’ll hand your life over to your enemies, the daughters of the Philistines, who were ashamed of your obscene behaviour.
\p
\v 28 You’ve acted like a prostitute with the Assyrians because you couldn’t be satisfied. You acted like a prostitute and still you weren’t satisfied.
\v 29 \add So\add* you performed many more acts of prostitution in \add Babylonia\add* (the \add country\add* of the merchants of Chaldea), and even that didn’t satisfy you.
\v 30 Your heart is so sick that you would do things like that—things that only a shameless prostitute would do. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p
\v 31 You made your mounds at the head of every street and built your tall shrines in every public square, \add yet\add* you weren’t like a prostitute \add in the sense that\add* you scoffed at taking payment.
\v 32 You adulterous woman, you \add prefer\add* strangers \add over\add* your husband.
\v 33 \add It’s normal for\add* \add clients to pay\add* the prostitute, but you \add do the opposite\add*: you give your wages to all your lovers and bribe them to come to you from all around for your acts of prostitution.
\v 34 \add Yes,\add* there’s a difference between you and other women. No one offers payment for you to act as a prostitute. You’re the very opposite—you \add paid\add* them \add but\add* nothing was given to you.
\s1 The punishment of God of Yerushalem
\p
\v 35 Therefore, \add Yerushalem\add* you prostitute, listen to Yahweh’s message.
\v 36 The master Yahweh says this: ‘Because you’ve poured out your lust and uncovered your nakedness through your acts of prostitution with your lovers and with all your detestable idols, and because you gave them your children’s blood,
\v 37 then listen: I will gather all your lovers that you’ve met, \add including the ones\add* you loved and the ones you hated, and I will gather them against you on every side. I’ll uncover your nakedness to them so they see all your nakedness.
\v 38 Then I’ll punish you for your adultery and the shedding of blood, and I’ll bring on you the bloodshed of my anger and passion.
\v 39 I’ll \add allow them to conquer you\add* so they’ll \add tear apart\add* your raised chamber and break down your high places, and they’ll strip you of your clothes and take all of your jewellery—leaving you naked and bare.
\p
\v 40 Then they’ll bring a crowd up against you and stone you with stones, and they’ll cut you apart with their swords.
\v 41 They’ll burn down your houses and will \add punish you in several ways\add* in the sight of many women, because I’ll put a stop to your prostitution, and you will no longer pay your lovers.
\v 42 Then I’ll calm my rage against you. My anger will leave you, because I’ll be satisfied and won’t be angry \add at you\add* any longer.
\p
\v 43 Because you didn’t call to mind your younger days and made me shake with anger because of all those things, therefore, listen: I myself will bring the punishment for what you’ve done down onto your own head. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\s1 Ke what the mother like just the child woman
\p Haven’t you added prostitution to all your other detestable practices?
\v 44 Listen, everyone who speaks proverbs about you will say, “Like mother, like daughter.”
\v 45 You are the daughter of your mother, who detested her husband and her children, and you are the sister of your sisters who detested their husbands and their children. Your mother was a Hittite, and your father was an Amorite.
\p
\v 46 Your older sister was Shomron \add (Samaria)\add* and her daughters were the ones living in the north, while your younger sister was the one living south of you, that is, Sodom and her daughters.
\v 47 \add Not only did you follow\add* their ways and copy their behaviour and practices, but in \add everything that you did\add*, you’ve been \em worse\em* than they were.
\p
\v 48 This is the master Yahweh’s declaration: As I live, your sister Sodom and her daughters, didn’t do as much evil as you and your daughters have done.
\v 49 Listen, your sister Sodom’s sin was that she was arrogant in her leisure, careless and unconcerned about anything. She didn’t \add assist\add* the poor and needy people.
\v 50 She was arrogant and committed disgusting actions \add in front of\add* me, so I took them away just as you have seen.
\p
\v 51 As for Shomron \add (Samaria)\add*, they didn’t commit even half of your sins, instead, you’ve done many more disgusting things than they did, and you’ve shown that your sisters were better than you because of all the disgusting things that you do.
\v 52 Also how you display your own shame—you’ve shown that your sisters were better than you by the sins you committed in all those disgusting ways. Your sisters now seem better than you.
\p
\v 53 From their captivity, I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and her daughters, and of Shomron \add (Samaria)\add* and her daughters, and your fortunes \add will be similar\add*\f + \fr 16:53 \ft i.e., to go into captivity, but then after a time, to be restored.\f*
\v 54 so that you will display your shame. You’ll be humiliated because of everything that you’ve done, and in that way you’ll be a consolation to \add Sodom and Shomron\add*.
\v 55 Your sister Sodom and her daughters will be restored to their former condition, and Shomron and her daughters will be restored \add similarly\add*. Then you and your daughters will be restored to your former condition.
\v 56 \add You never even mentioned your sister Sodom in the period when you were proud\add*
\v 57 before your wickedness was revealed. But now you’re an object of scorn to the daughters of Aram \add (Syria)\add* and to all the daughters of the Philistines around her. People all around despise you.
\v 58 You’ll display your shame and your disgusting actions. That is Yahweh’s declaration.
\s1 The agreement without ending
\p
\v 59 The master Yahweh says this: ‘I’ll deal with you as you deserve—you who’ve despised your oath by breaking \add our\add* agreement.
\v 60 But I myself will call to mind my agreement with you that was made \add when you were younger\add*, and I’ll establish a never-ending agreement with you.
\v 61 Then you’ll call to mind your ways and be ashamed when you receive your older sisters and your younger sisters. I’ll give them to you as daughters, but not because of your agreement.
\v 62 I myself will establish my agreement with you, and you’ll know that I am Yahweh
\v 63 so that you’ll call everything to mind and be ashamed. Then you’ll no longer open your mouth to speak because of your shame, when I have forgiven you for everything that you’ve done. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.’ ”
\c 17
\s1 The two eagles and the vine
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, present a riddle and speak a parable to the \add Israeli people\add*.
\v 3 Tell \add them\add*, ‘The master Yahweh says this: ‘A large eagle with large wings full of multi-coloured feathers, and long pinions, went to Lebanon and grabbed hold of the top of a cedar tree.
\v 4 He broke the top shoot of \add the tree\add* off, and took it to Canaan \add where he\add* placed it in a city \add full\add* of merchants.
\v 5 He \add also\add* took some of the seed of the land and planted it in fertile soil, \add beside a large body of water where\add* a willow \add might grow\add*.
\v 6 Then \add the seed\add* sprouted and became a spreading vine low to the ground. Its branches turned toward him, and its roots grew \add down below\add*, so it became a vine and produced branches and sent out shoots.
\p
\v 7 \add But\add* there was another large eagle with large wings and many feathers. Oh wow, that vine turned its roots toward this eagle, and it spread out its branches toward the eagle from the place it had been planted so it might get watered.
\v 8 It had been planted in good soil beside a large body of water so it would grow branches and produce fruit, to become a magnificent vine.’
\p
\v 9 \add Ask\add* \add the people\add*: ‘The master Yahweh wants to know if it will prosper? Won’t it be uprooted and stripped of its fruit so that it withers, and all its fresh growth will dry out? \add You wouldn’t have to be very strong or get lots of people to help\add* to pull it out by its roots.
\v 10 So listen. After it had been planted, would it thrive? Wouldn’t it wither up when the eastern wind touches it? \add Yes,\add* it would wither right up in the garden plot where it sprouted.’ ”
\s1 The vine part of the parable explained
\p
\v 11 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 12 “\add Ask\add* those rebellious \add people\add*, ‘Don’t you know what those things mean? Listen, the king of Babylon came to Yerushalem and took her king and her princes and took them with him to Babylon.\x + \xo 17:12-15: \xt 2Ki 24:15-20; 2Ch 36:10.\x*
\v 13 Then he took \add a member\add* of the royal family, made an agreement with him—\add forcing him to make various commitments\add*. Then he took away the \add country’s\add* \add former\add* powerful people,
\v 14 so the kingdom would remain \add subjected and not be able to become powerful again\add*. \add However,\add* by keeping the agreement, the \add country\add* would \add at least\add* survive.
\v 15 But the king of Yerushalem rebelled against him by sending his ambassadors to Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add* to acquire horses and an army. Will he succeed? Will the one doing these things escape? If he breaks the agreement, will he \add survive\add*?
\v 16 This is the master Yahweh’s declaration: As I live he’ll definitely die in the land of the king who made him king, the king whose promises he despised, and whose agreement he broke. He’ll die in the middle of Babylon.
\v 17 \add Egypt’s\add* Far-oh \add (Pharaoh)\add* with his mighty army and a large company won’t help him in battle, when ramps are constructed and siege walls are built up to cut off many lives
\v 18 because the king despised his promise by breaking the agreement. Wow, he reached out to make a promise and yet \add afterwards\add* he did all those things. He won’t escape.
\v 19 Therefore the master Yahweh says this: ‘As I live, wasn’t it my promise that he despised and my agreement that he broke? \add Therefore\add* I’ll \add cause him to be punished for what he did\add*.
\v 20 I’ll spread my net out over him, and he’ll be caught in my trap, and I’ll take him to Babylon and handle his judgement there for the treason he committed when he betrayed me.
\v 21 All of his refugees in his armies will fall by the sword, and the ones who remain will be scattered in every direction. Then you’ll all know that I am Yahweh because I’ve declared that that will happen.”
\s1 The tree-tip part of the parable explained
\p
\v 22 The master Yahweh says this, ‘So I myself will take away the highest part of the cedar tree, and I will plant it away from its tender branches. I’ll break it off, and I myself will plant it on a very high mountain.
\v 23 I’ll plant it on Yisrael’s highest mountain so it will bear branches and produce fruit, and it will become a majestic cedar so that every winged bird will live under it. They’ll nest in the shade of its branches,
\v 24 then all the trees in the countryside will know that I am Yahweh. I bring down the high trees and I raise up the low trees. I wither the watered tree and I cause the dried tree to bloom. I am Yahweh, I have declared that that will happen; and I will do it.’ ”
\c 18
\s1 Individual responsibility
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 2 “What do you mean, you who use this proverb concerning Yisrael and say, ‘Fathers eat sour grapes, \add but it’s\add* the children’s teeth that are \add set on edge\add*’?
\p
\v 3 This is the master Yahweh’s declaration: as I live there’ll \add certainly no longer be any occasion for you to use\add* this proverb in Yisrael.
\v 4 Listen, every life belongs to me: the life of the father as well as \add that\add* of the son—they belong to me. The \add one who disobeys\add* is the one who’ll die.
\s2 The godly man
\p
\v 5 If there was a \add godly\add* \add man\add* who did what was fair and right,
\v 6 who doesn’t eat at the \add hilltop\add* \add shrines\add*, who doesn’t \add request help\add* from Yisrael’s idols, who doesn’t \add mess with\add* someone else’s wife or a menstruating woman,
\v 7 who doesn’t oppress anyone, and he gives back to the debtor what was put up as security for a loan, he doesn’t \add steal\add* \add but rather\add* gives his food to the hungry and \add gives clothes to those without them\add*,
\v 8 who doesn’t charge too much interest if he loans \add money\add*, and doesn’t take too much profit for what he sells, he promotes true justice \add within the community\add*,
\v 9 who \add follows\add* my instructions and \add faithfully obeys\add* my regulations, that man will be \add acquitted\add* \add and\add* will definitely live. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.\x + \xo 18:9: \xt Lev 18:5.\x*
\s3 The wayward son of the godly man
\p
\v 10 \add But\add* suppose \add that godly man\add* had a violent son who kills and sadly \add goes against all those things above\add*,
\v 11 not \add following\add* the ways of his \add godly\add* father, but \add rather\add* has eaten at the \add hilltop\add* \add shrines\add* and has \add slept with someone else’s\add* wife,
\v 12 he oppresses the poor and needy, and he steals and robs, and he does not return \add something given as\add* a pledge, and he \add requests help from\add* idols and does \add disgusting things\add*,
\v 13 and he lends out money at too high interest and he makes too much profit on what he sells, should that man live? He certainly won’t! He’ll definitely die and his blood will be on \add his own head\add*.
\s3 The peace/prosperity of child righteous/honest/sensible
\p
\v 14 But listen, suppose he has a son, and his son sees all the sins that his father has committed, and though he sees them, he doesn’t do those things.
\v 15 he hasn’t eaten at the \add hilltop\add* \add shrines\add*, and hasn’t \add requested help from the Israeli people’s idols\add*, and hasn’t \add slept with someone else’s\add* wife,
\v 16 he doesn’t oppress anyone, or \add keep things given as\add* a pledge, or \add receive\add* stolen things, but instead gives his food to the hungry and \add gives clothes to those without them\add*,
\v 17 he’s turned his back on \add crime\add*, and doesn’t charge high interest, he \add follows\add* my instructions and \add obeys\add* my regulations, he won’t die for his father’s \add evil deeds\add* but he’ll certainly live.
\v 18 His father, since he oppressed others by extortion and robbed \add people\add*, and did what is not good among his people—listen, he’ll die in his sin.
\p
\v 19 \add But you all ask\add*, ‘Why doesn’t the son \add also\add* have to \add pay the cost for his family’s crimes\add*?’ \add Well\add* it’s because the son \add promotes\add* justice and godliness and \add follows\add* all my instructions. He’ll definitely live.
\v 20 The one who sins is the one who’ll die. The children won’t \add have to\add* bear their parents’ sin, and the parents won’t bear their children’s sins—the righteousness of those who act rightly will be on themselves, and the wickedness of the wicked will be on themselves.\x + \xo 18:20: \xt Deu 24:16.\x*
\s2 The person repent of sins he/his
\p
\v 21 \add But\add* if the wicked \add person\add* turns away from all \add their disobedience\add*, and \add follows\add* all my instructions and \add does what is right and fair\add*, then \add that person\add* will certainly live and not die.
\v 22 All \add their acts of disobedience\add* won’t be called to mind against them. They’ll live by the \add right things that they do\add*.
\v 23 That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p Do I \add celebrate happily\add* over the death of the wicked and not in their turning away from their ways so that they may live?
\v 24 \add But\add* if a righteous person turns away from their righteousness and \add disobeys\add* and \add does disgusting things like\add* the wicked people do, then will they live? All the \add good things\add* that had been done won’t be called to mind when they betray me in their treason, so they’ll die in the sins that they committed.
\p
\v 25 \add But you all complain\add* that the master’s way isn’t correct. Please listen \add you\add* \add Israeli people\add*: is it my ways that aren’t correct, or is it \em your\em* ways?
\v 26 When the righteous person turns away from their righteousness, and commits iniquity and dies because of them, then \add that person\add* will die in the iniquity that they’ve done.
\v 27 \add But\add* when a wicked person turns away from the wicked things that they’ve done and \add does what is fair and what is right\add*, then \add that person\add* will preserve their life—
\v 28 they’ve \add become aware of all their acts of disobedience\add* and turned away from them. \add That person\add* certainly won’t die \add but\add* will live.
\v 29 \add But the Israeli people insist\add*, ‘The master’s way isn’t fair!’ How is my way not fair, \add people\add* of Yisrael? It’s \em your\em* ways that aren’t fair.
\v 30 Therefore I will judge each person among you according to their ways, \add you Israeli people\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p Repent and turn away from all your transgressions so that they won’t be stumbling blocks of iniquity against you.
\v 31 Throw off all the \add acts of disobedience that you’ve all done\add*. \add Work towards\add* a new heart and a new spirit for yourselves. Why should you die, \add people\add* of Yisrael,
\v 32 because I take no pleasure in the death of the one who dies. That’s the master Yahweh’s declaration \add so\add* \add turn from your evil behaviour\add* and live.

\v 5 \add The mother lion\add* waited for his return,
\q1 \add but eventually she realised that he wasn’t coming back\add*,
\q1 so she took another one of her cubs and made him into a young lion.
\q1
\v 6 This young lion roamed around amongst the \add other\add* lions.
\q1 He was a young lion and learned to tear his victims—
\q1 he devoured men.
\q1
\v 7 He \add seized\add* their fortresses and ruined their cities.
\q1 The land and its \add produce\add* was abandoned
\q1 because of the sound of his roaring.
\q1
\v 8 But the nations came against him from the surrounding provinces.
\q1 They spread their nets over him—
\q1 he was caught in their pit.
\q1
\v 9 With hooks \add in him\add*, they put him in a cage
\q1 and then they took him to the Babylonian king.
\q1 They took him to the fortresses
\q1 so that his voice would no longer be heard in Yisrael’s hills.

\q1
\v 10 Your mother was like a vine planted in your vineyard beside the water.
\q1 It was fruitful and full of branches because \add there was plenty\add* of water.
\q1
\v 11 It had strong branches that were used for \add making\add* rulers scepters,
\q1 and it towered above the branches,
\q1 and its height could be seen due to the mass of its foliage.
\q1
\v 12 \add But\add* the vine was uprooted in fury and thrown down onto the ground,
\q1 and an eastern wind dried out its fruit.
\q1 Its strong branches were broken off and withered,
\q1 and then burnt in a fire.
\q1
\v 13 So now it’s planted in the wilderness—
\q1 in a land of drought and thirst.
\q1
\v 14 Fire went out from its large branches and consumed its fruit.
\q1 There’s no strong branches \add left\add* on it—no scepter to rule.’
\m That is a song of mourning and should be sung as \add such\add*.”

\s1 Israeli rebellion
\p
\v 1 \add Seven years\add* \add after we’d been taken to Babylon\add*, \add some\add* Israeli elders came to \add get me to ask Yahweh for advice for them\add*.
\v 2 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add this\add* message:
\v 3 “Humanity’s child, tell the Israeli elders that the master Yahweh says this: ‘Have you all come to \add get advice from me\add*? As I live, I won’t \add allow you to ask for my advice\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.’
\p
\v 4 Will you judge them? Will you judge, humanity’s child? Let them know about their ancestors’ \add disgusting behaviour\add*.
\v 5 Tell them that the master Yahweh says this: ‘On the day that I chose Yisrael and made myself known to them in Egypt, I raised my hand to \add make a promise\add* to Yakov’s descendants. I told \add them\add*, “I am Yahweh your God”\x + \xo 20:5-6: \xt Exo 6:2-8.\x*—
\v 6 on that day I raised my hand to \add make a promise\add* to them that I would bring them out of Egypt into a land that I had carefully selected for them. It was flowing with milk and honey—it was the most beautiful of all the lands.
\v 7 I told them, “Let each \add family\add* throw away the idols from Egypt plus \add any other detestable things they have\add*. Don’t \add defile\add* yourselves. I am Yahweh your God.”
\v 8 \add But\add* they rebelled against me and were unwilling to listen to me. \add They\add* didn’t throw away the detestable things \add they have\add* or abandon their Egyptian idols, so I determined to pour out my fury upon them to satisfy my rage among them \add right there\add* in Egypt.
\v 9 I \add did that to protect my reputation\add* so it wouldn’t be \add tarnished\add* in the eyes of the nations \add where they were staying\add*. I made myself \add clearly\add* known to them\f + \fr 20:9 \ft them: Probably referring to those countries, but some translations interpret it to refer to the ones being brought out.\f* by bringing them out of Egypt.
\p
\v 10 \add So\add* I led them out of Egypt and took them into the wilderness.
\v 11 Then I gave them my instructions and regulations—\add anyone who follows\add* them will live.\x + \xo 20:11-13: \xt Lev 18:5.\x*
\v 12 I also \add established rest days\add* as a sign between myself and them—for them to know that I am Yahweh who \add declares them different from others\add*.\x + \xo 20:12: \xt Exo 31:13-17.\x*
\v 13 \add But the Israeli people\add* rebelled against me in the wilderness. They \add wouldn’t follow my instructions\add* and they rejected my regulations, when if they’d obeyed them, they would live. They severely disrespected my rest days, so I said I’d pour my fury out on them in the wilderness in order to end them.
\v 14 \add But I did that to protect my reputation\add* so it wouldn’t be \add tarnished\add* in the eyes of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out \add of Egypt\add*.
\v 15 So I myself \add took action by making a promise\add* to them in the wilderness not to bring them into the land that I had been going to give them—a land flowing with milk and honey which was the most beautiful out of all the lands.\x + \xo 20:15: \xt Num 14:26-35.\x*
\v 16 I promised that because they had rejected my instructions and \add follow my regulations\add* and they disrespected my rest days, because \add what they really wanted was\add* their idols.
\v 17 \add But\add* I pitied them so I didn’t \add wipe them out\add* in the wilderness.
\p
\v 18 I told their children in the wilderness, “Don’t \add follow your parents’ habits or behaviour\add*, and don’t defile yourselves with their idols.
\v 19 I am Yahweh your God—\add follow my instructions, obey my regulations\add*,
\v 20 and keep my rest days \add different from other days\add* so that they’ll be a sign between me and you. \add That way\add* you’ll all know that I am Yahweh your God.”
\p
\v 21 \add However\add* their sons and daughters rebelled against me. They didn’t \add keep my instructions or follow my regulations\add*, when if they’d obeyed them, they would live. They disrespected my rest days, so I determined to pour out my fury upon them to satisfy my rage against them in the wilderness.
\v 22 \add But I didn’t proceed for the sake of my reputation\add*, so it wouldn’t be mocked by the nations \add who saw me\add* bring the Israelis out \add of Egypt\add*.
\v 23 \add So I took action\add* in the wilderness, \add promising that instead\add* I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them into other countries.\x + \xo 20:23: \xt Lev 26:33.\x*
\v 24 I decided to do that since they hadn’t obeyed my instructions, and since they had rejected my regulations and disrespected my rest days—\add they really wanted\add* their fathers’ idols.
\p
\v 25 Then I even gave them instructions that weren’t good, and regulations that they couldn’t live by.
\v 26 I declared them to be defiled \add because of the gifts they gave\add* (they sacrificed every \add woman’s\add* firstborn child in the fire) so that I could fill them with horror so they would know that I am Yahweh.’
\p
\v 27 Therefore, humanity’s child, speak to the \add Israeli people\add* and tell them that the master Yahweh says this: ‘That was also how your ancestors blasphemed me when they were unfaithful to me.
\v 28 When I brought them into the land that I’d promised to give them, then whenever they saw any high hill and leafy tree, they offered their sacrifices. They provoked me with their offerings, and also burnt their fragrant incense there and poured out their drink offerings.
\v 29 Then I \add asked\add* them, “What’s this high place where you present your offerings?” so the place is called Bamah \add (meaning ‘High place’)\add* to this day.’
\p
\v 30 Therefore tell the \add Israeli people\add* that the master Yahweh \add asks\add* this: ‘Why do you all \add defile yourselves\add* with the ways of your ancestors? So why do you act like prostitutes, searching for disgusting things?
\v 31 When you offer up your gifts to this day (\add offering\add* your sons \add as burnt sacrifices\add*), you defile yourselves with all your idols. So why should I let you \add try to find me, you Israeli people\add*? As I live, I won’t allow you all to \add request my help or advice\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 32 The thought that is forming in your mind will never happen. You all say, “Let us be like the other nations—like the clans in other \add countries\add* who worship wood and stone.”
\s1 Punishment and forgiveness
\p
\v 33 This is the master Yahweh’s declaration: As I live, I will certainly reign over you all with \add strict control\add*, and with fury that will be poured out on you.
\v 34 I’ll bring you all out from the other peoples and will gather you out of the countries where you’ve all been scattered. I’ll do this with \add power\add* and with fury poured out.
\v 35 Then I’ll bring you all into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will judge you all face to face—
\v 36 just like I judged your fathers in the Egyptian wilderness, so I’ll also judge you all. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p
\v 37 I will cause you all to pass under my staff \add to be counted\add*, and I’ll make you obey the requirements of \add our\add* agreement.
\v 38 I will purge the rebels out from among you, as well as those who revolt against me. I’ll send them out from the land where they are staying \add as foreigners\add*, but they won’t enter Yisrael. Then you’ll all know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 39 So to all you \add Israeli people\add*, the master Yahweh says this: ‘Each of you should go to his own idols. Worship them if you refuse to listen to me, but you must no longer desecrate my sacred name with your gifts and your idols
\v 40 because this is the master Yahweh’s declaration: all the \add Israeli people\add* will worship me there on my sacred mountain in Yisrael. I’ll be happy to accept your offerings there, along with your choice gifts \add dedicated to me\add*.
\v 41 I will accept you like a soothing aroma when I bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you all have been scattered. I’ll \add display my holiness\add* among you for the nations to see.
\v 42 You’ll all know that I am Yahweh when I bring you \add back\add* to Yisrael—to the land that I promised to give to your ancestors.
\v 43 There you’ll all \add call to mind\add* your conduct and \add everything that you defiled yourselves by doing\add*, and you’ll despise yourselves in your own eyes for all the evil things that you’ve done.
\v 44 Then you’ll all know that I am Yahweh when I do this to you for the sake of my \add reputation\add*, i.e., not because of your evil deeds, and not because of your corrupt deeds, \add you Israeli people\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.’ ”
\s1 The burnt forest
\p
\v 45 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 46 “Humanity’s child, \add look\add* towards the southern lands, and speak against the south—prophesy against the Negev forest.
\v 47 Tell the forest that this is the master Yahweh’s declaration: See, I will set a fire among you. It will burn up every \add tree among you, whether living or dead\add*. The fiery flame won’t \add be able to\add* be put out—every \add area\add* from the north to the south will be burnt.
\v 48 Then \add every person\add* will see that I am Yahweh when I light the fire, and it won’t get extinguished.’ ”
\p
\v 49 Then I said, “Oh no, my master Yahweh, now they’re \add wondering if I’m just someone who tells\add* \add cute\add* parables.”
\c 21
\s1 Yahweh’s piercing sword
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, \add look\add* towards Yerushalem, and speak against the sacred places and prophesy against Yisrael.
\v 3 Tell Yisrael that Yahweh says this: Listen, I’m against you. I’ll draw my sword from its sheath \add to kill\add* both the righteous and the wicked among you.
\v 4 \add Yes,\add* in order for me to \add eliminate\add* both the righteous and the wicked from you, my sword will go out from its sheath against \add everyone\add* from the south to the north,
\v 5 then \add everyone\add* will know that I, Yahweh, have drawn my sword from its sheath. It will no longer hold back.’
\p
\v 6 As for you, humanity’s child, groan \add as if your pelvis has cracked\add*. Groan \add bitterly in front of them\add*.
\v 7 \add That’ll get the people\add* asking you, ‘What are you groaning about?’ Then you’ll tell \add them\add*, ‘Because of the news that’s coming, because every \add stomach will go tense\add* and every hand will tremble. \add Breathing will become difficult\add*, and every knee will \add turn to jelly\add*. Listen, it’s coming and \add that’s what it’ll be like\add*. That’s the master Yahweh’s declaration.’ ”
\p
\v 8 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 9 “Humanity’s child, prophesy and tell them that the master says this:
\q1 “A sword! A sword!
\q1 It will be sharpened and polished.
\q1
\v 10 It will be sharpened in order to engage in great slaughter!
\q1 It will be polished in order to be like lightning!
\q1 Should we rejoice in my son’s scepter?
\q1 The coming sword hates every such rod.
\q1
\v 11 So the sword will be given to be polished,
\q1 and then to be grasped by the hand.
\q1 The sword is sharpened and polished
\q1 and will be \add handed to\add* the one who kills!” ’ ”
\q1
\v 12 Call for help and wail, humanity’s child,
\q1 because that sword has come against my people.
\q1 It’s against all of Yisrael’s leaders—
\q1 they’re thrown against the sword along with my people.
\q1 Therefore, \add hammer your fists against the wall\add*
\q1
\v 13 because \add testing will come\add*,
\q1 but what if the scepter doesn’t last?
\m That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\q1
\v 14 Now humanity’s child, prophesy and clap your two hands together loudly,
\q1 because the sword will attack even a third time.
\q1 A sword for the ones to be slaughtered.
\q1 It’s a sword for the many to be slaughtered,
\q1 piercing them wherever \add they run\add*.
\q1
\v 15 In order to melt their hearts and to multiply their fallen,
\q1 I’ve placed the sword for slaughter at all their gates.
\q1 Ah, it flashes like lightning.
\q1 It’s held tightly for slaughter.
\q1
\v 16 You, sword, strike to the right.
\q1 Strike to the left.
\q1 Go \add in whichever direction you’re facing\add*
\q1
\v 17 because I will also clap my two hands together
\q1 and then I’ll \add cease\add* my fury.
\q1 I, Yahweh, declare it.”
\s1 The sword of Babylon’s king
\p
\v 18 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 19 “Now humanity’s child, assign two roads for the sword of Babylon’s king to come on. The two roads will start in the same land, and a signpost will mark one of them as leading to a city.
\v 20 Mark one road for the Babylonian army to come to Rabbah, the city of the Ammonites. Mark the other to lead the army to Yehudah and the fortified city of Yerushalem,
\v 21 because the Babylonian king will stop at the crossroads, at the junction, in order to practice divination. He’ll shake some arrows and ask direction from some idols, and he’ll examine a liver.
\v 22 With his right hand \add he’ll take\add* the sign for Yerushalem: to set battering rams against it, to open his mouth to order the slaughter, to sound a war cry, to set battering rams against the gates, to build a ramp, and to erect siege towers.
\v 23 \add From the perspective\add* of those in Yerushalem, it would seem to be a pointless sign as they’d made a treaty with the Babylonians, but the king will accuse them of violating their treaty so he can besiege them.
\p
\v 24 Therefore the master Yahweh says this: You’ve caused your guilt to be noticed by revealing your \add disobedience\add*, so that you sins will be obvious through all your actions. Because you’ve done that, you’ll be taken \add by force\add*.
\v 25 As for you, profane and wicked ruler of Yisrael, your time of \add going against me\add* has \add now\add* ended and your day of punishment has come.
\v 26 The master Yahweh \add instructs\add* you: Remove the turban and take off the crown. Things will no longer be the same. \add I’ll give power to those who had none, and disgrace those who had power\add*.
\v 27 A ruin. A ruin. \add Yes,\add* I’ll make it a ruin. It won’t be restored until the one comes who is assigned to execute judgement.
\s1 Yahweh warns the Ammonites
\p
\v 28 So you, humanity’s child, prophesy and say, ‘The master Yahweh says this to the Ammonites concerning their coming disgrace: A sword, a sword is drawn. It’s sharpened for the slaughter in order to devour, so it will be like lightning.\x + \xo 21:28-32: \xt Jer 49:1-6; Eze 25:1-7; Amos 1:3-15; Zeph 2:8-11; Gen 19:36-38; Jdg 3:12-13; 10:6-11.\x*
\v 29 While prophets see empty visions for you and perform rituals to come up with lies for you, this sword will lie on the necks of the wicked who are about to be killed, whose day of punishment has come and whose time of \add disobedience\add* is about to end.
\rem s1 Babylon’s end ???
\p
\v 30 Return the sword to its sheath. I’ll judge you in the place of your creation. In the land of your origin
\v 31 I’ll pour my indignation out on you! I’ll fan the fire of my rage against you and \add hand you over to\add* cruel men—craftsmen of destruction.
\v 32 You’ll become fuel for the fire. Your blood will be \add spilled right there\add* in \add your own\add* land. You won’t be remembered, because I, Yahweh have declared it.’ ”
\c 22
\s1 Yerushalem’s evil ways
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 2 “Now you, humanity’s child, will you judge the city of blood? Will you judge \add Yerushalem\add*? Make her \add understand all her disgusting behaviour\add*.
\v 3 Tell them that the master Yahweh says this: You’re a city that sheds blood \add right there in her centre, forcing\add* her time \add of judgement\add* to come—a city that makes idols to defile herself.
\v 4 You’ve become guilty by the blood that you’ve poured out, and you’ve become defiled by the idols that you’ve made. You’ve drawn your days to a close, and the end of your years has come, so I’ll \add allow the other nations to laugh at you and mock you\add*.
\v 5 You unclean \add city\add* full of confusion, those who are both near and far will deride you.
\p
\v 6 Listen, each of Yisrael’s rulers \add has used their own resources to go\add* to you, \add Yerushalem\add*, to shed blood.
\v 7 They’ve dishonoured the fathers and mothers within you, and they’ve oppressed the foreigners there among you. They’ve mistreated the orphans and the widows within you.\x + \xo 22:7: a \xt Exo 20:12; Deu 5:16; \xo b \xt Exo 22:21-22; Deu 24:17.\x*
\v 8 You’ve despised my sacred things and disrespected my rest days.\x + \xo 22:8: \xt Lev 19:30; 26:2.\x*
\v 9 Slanderous men have come within you in order to pour out blood, and they eat at the hilltop \add shrines\add*. They do wicked things right there in your centre.
\v 10 Within you men uncover the nakedness of their father. Within you they have violated women during their ‘unclean’ menstrual period.\x + \xo 22:10-11: \xt Lev 18:7-20.\x*
\v 11 Men who \add sleep\add* with their neighbours’ wives, and men who \add sleep with\add* their own daughters-in-law, \add even\add* men who abuse their own sisters \add or half-sisters\add*. All these are done within you.
\v 12 Those men \add are involved in paid assassinations\add* within you, plus you’ve taken interest and gained too much profit, and you’ve damaged your neighbours through oppression, and you’ve forgotten me.

\p
\v 13 Listen, \add Yerushalem\add*. \add I’ve reached out and taken away\add* the dishonest gain that you’ve made, and the bloodshed that’s done in your centre.
\v 14 Will your heart \add keep beating\add* when I deal with you myself? Will your hands be \add be able to resist trembling\add*? I, Yahweh, am declaring this, and I will do it.
\v 15 I will scatter you among the nations and disperse you through the lands—that’s how I’ll purge your uncleanness from you,

\s1 Yahweh’s separating out the rubble
\p
\v 17 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 18 “Humanity’s child, the \add Israeli people\add* have become like dross to me. All of them are the leftovers of bronze and tin, and iron and lead among you—they’ll be like the dross from silver in your furnace.
\v 19 Therefore the master Yahweh says this, ‘Because all of you have become like dross, then listen: I’m about to gather you into the centre of Yerushalem.
\v 20 Just like men gather silver, bronze, iron, lead, and tin, and put it inside a furnace to melt it then blast the fire onto it in order to melt it, so \add too\add* I’ll gather you in my anger and my rage, and I’ll put you in there and melt you.
\v 21 \add Yes,\add* I’ll gather you and blow my fire of fury onto you, and you’ll be melted in the middle of it.
\v 22 As silver is melted in a furnace, you will be melted in it, and you will know that I, Yahweh, have poured my wrath out onto you!’ ”
\s1 The sins of Yisrael’s teachers
\p
\v 23 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 24 “Humanity’s child, tell her, ‘You’re a land that hasn’t been cleansed. \add When you’re judged, there won’t be any\add* rain.
\v 25 There’s a conspiracy of her prophets in her midst, like a roaring lion tearing apart a victim. They consume life and take precious wealth—making many widows within her.

\s1 The parable of two prostitutes
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, \add once there was a woman who had\add* two daughters
\v 3 \add who as young women\add*, prostituted themselves in Egypt. Their breasts were squeezed and their virgin nipples were fondled there.
\v 4 The older one was Oholah (referring to Shomron \add or Samaria\add*) and her younger sister was Oholibah (referring to Yerushalem). Then they became \add my wives\add* and had sons and daughters.
\s2 The sin and punishment of Shomron/Samaria
\p
\v 5 \add But\add* Oholah prostituted herself even when she was mine. She lusted for her lovers: for the Assyrian warriors,
\v 6 princes and captains \add dressed in fine clothes\add*. They were choice, young men riding their horses,
\v 7 and she gave them sexual favours. They were all the best of Assyria’s men, and she defiled herself with everyone she lusted for, and with all their idols.
\v 8 She hadn’t left her prostitute behaviour behind in Egypt, when they had slept with her when she in her youth—caressing her virgin nipples and pouring their lust out on her.
\p
\v 9 That’s why I \add handed her over to\add* her lovers—those Assyrians that she lusted for.
\v 10 They uncovered her nakedness, took her sons and daughters, and killed her with the sword. She had become notorious among women, so they executed judgement on her.
\s2 Yerushalem’s sin
\p
\v 11 Her sister Oholibah saw that, but she lusted more passionately and prostituted herself even more wildly than her sister.
\v 12 She \add also\add* lusted for the Assyrians, the governors and the dominating officials who rode horses and dressed impressively. All of them were strong, handsome men.
\v 13 I saw that she had defiled herself \add just like her older sister\add*.
\p
\v 14 Then she increased her prostitution even more. She saw men carved on walls, figures of Chaldeans painted in red,
\v 15 wearing belts around their waists, with flowing turbans on their heads. All of them looked like chariot troop officers, similar to Babylonians (whose native land is Chaldea).
\v 16 As soon as \add she\add* saw \add those drawings\add*, she lusted for \add those men\add*, so she sent messengers out to them in Chaldea.
\v 17 The Babylonians came to her and to her bed of lust, and they defiled her with their promiscuousness. \add Yes,\add* she had defiled herself by what she’d done, \add so\add* she turned herself away from them in disgust.
\v 18 When she’d exposed her nakedness and openly \add been involved in\add* prostitution, I turned away from her just like I’d turned away in disgust from her sister.
\v 19 Then she increased her prostitution as she remembered when she was a young prostitute in Egypt
\v 20 and she lusted for her lovers whose private parts were \add long\add* like those of donkeys, and whose emissions of semen were \add huge\add* like those of stallions.
\v 21 That’s how you had committed those shameful acts of your youth, when the Egyptians \add fondled\add* your nipples and \add squeezed\add* your young breasts.
\s2 Yahweh’s judgement of Yerushalem
\p
\v 22 Therefore, Oholibah, the master Yahweh says this, ‘Listen, I’ll turn your lovers against you. I’ll bring those that you rejected against you from every side:
\v 23 the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them—strong, handsome men, governors and commanders, all of them are officers and men of reputation, all of them riding on horses.
\v 24 They’ll bring many people against you with weapons, as well as chariots and wagons. They will place \add units with\add* large shields, small shields, and helmets all around against you. I’ll get them to punish you, and they’ll punish you with their actions.
\v 25 I’ll direct my jealous anger at you, and they’ll deal with you in fury. They’ll cut off your noses and your ears, and even the survivors will fall by the sword. They’ll take away your sons and your daughters and \add the remainder will be burnt\add*.
\v 26 They’ll strip off your clothes and take away all your \add jewellery\add*.
\v 27 I will remove your shameful behaviour from you, and your acts of prostitution from Egypt. You’ll \add give up your longing looks towards them\add*, and you won’t think about Egypt any more,’
\v 28 because the master Yahweh says this, Listen, I’ll \add hand you over to\add* the ones you hate—back into the \add control\add* of the ones that you had turned away from.
\v 29 They’ll \add show their hate for you as\add* they take all your possessions and abandon you naked and bare—\add yes,\add* your nakedness will be uncovered just like when you engaged in promiscuity and prostitution.
\v 30 These things will be done to you because of your acting like a prostitute—lusting after nations by which you became defiled with their idols.
\p
\v 31 You \add followed a similar path to that\add* of your \add older\add* sister, so I’ll \add give you the same punishment that I gave her\add*.’
\v 32 The master Yahweh says this, ‘You’ll \add suffer the same extreme suffering that your sister suffered\add*. You’ll become a laughingstock and a subject for derision—\add there’s a lot of pain coming your way\add*.
\v 33 You’ll be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, horror and devastation—\add the same suffering that your sister Shomron was made to drink\add*.
\v 34 You will drink \add that cup of suffering\add* and drain it empty, then you’ll shatter it and tear your breasts with the pieces. That’s the master Yahweh’s declaration.’
\p
\v 35 So the master Yahweh says this, ‘Because you’ve forgotten me and thrown me away behind your back, so also you will bear the consequences of your shameful behaviour and your prostitution.’ ”
\s2 Revealing the disgusting deeds of the sisters
\p
\v 36 Yahweh said to me, “Humanity’s child, will you judge Oholah and Oholibah? Present them \add a list of\add* their disgusting actions,
\v 37 since they’ve committed adultery, and also have blood on their hands. They’ve committed adultery \add by worshipping\add* their idols, and they have even caused their sons to pass through the fire \add to be considered\add* as food for their idols.
\v 38 Then \add on top of that\add*, they defile my sanctuary, and \add at the same time\add*, they disrespect my rest days.
\v 39 When they’d slaughtered their children for their idols, then they came to my sanctuary on the same day to desecrate it. So listen, that’s what they’ve done \add right there in my residence\add*.
\p
\v 40 You sent messengers \add to go and bring\add* men from far away. Now look, they indeed came—those who you \add prepared for by\add* bathing, painting your eyes, and adorning yourself with jewellery.
\v 41 You sat on a lovely couch bed with a table arranged \add in front of you\add* where you placed my incense and my \add olive\add* oil.
\v 42 Then the sound of a noisy crowd was around her as all kinds of men, even Sabeans were brought in from the wilderness, and they put bracelets on their hands and beautiful crowns on their heads.
\v 43 Then I said about \add that experienced adulterer\add*, ‘Now they’ll \add treat her as a prostitute\add*, and she’ll fornicate with them.’
\v 44 They \add had sex with\add* her like men do with a prostitute. In that way they \add had sex with\add* the two immoral women, Oholah and Oholibah.
\v 45 \add But\add* righteous men will pass judgement and punish them as adulteresses, and they’ll punish them with the \add appropriate\add* sentence for those who’ve shed blood, because they’re adulteresses plus they have blood on their hands.
\p
\v 46 So the master Yahweh says this: I’ll bring a company \add to attack\add* \add Shomron and Yerushalem\add* and give them up to be terrorized and plundered.
\v 47 Then that company will stone them with stones and cut them down with their swords. They’ll kill their \add children\add* and burn down their houses.
\v 48 \add That’s how\add* I’ll remove shameful behaviour from the land and discipline all the women so they’ll no longer act like prostitutes.
\v 49 They’ll use your shameful behaviour against you. You’ll all bear the guilt of your sins with your idols, and in that way you’ll know that I am the master Yahweh.”
\c 24
\s1 The rusty cooking pot
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message on the 15th of January of the ninth year \add since King Yoyakin (Jehoiachin) had been taken captive\add*.
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, write down \add the day and month\add* for yourself, because on this exact day, the Babylonian king \add started his siege of\add* Yerushalem.\x + \xo 24:2: \xt 2Ki 25:1.\x*
\v 3 \add So tell this parable to the rebellious Israeli people and explain that it comes from\add* the master Yahweh:
\q1 Pour water into the cooking pot and place it on the fire.
\q1
\v 4 Put in the leg and shoulder of a good \add sheep\add*
\q1 then fill it up with the best bones.
\q1
\v 5 \add Yes,\add* take the best one from the flock
\q1 and pile up the \add fuel\add* underneath it—
\q1 keeping it boiling to \add make sure that\add* the bones in it cook \add well\add*.
\p
\v 6 \add Now\add* the master Yahweh says this: The city of blood \add won’t end well\add*—\add it’s like\add* a cooking pot that has rust in it and that rust won’t come out of it. Take piece after piece out of it, but don’t \add be choosy about which pieces\add*
\v 7 because \add the blood she shed\add* is \add all the way\add* \add through\add* the middle of her. She \add displayed\add* it on a flat rock \add to be easily seen\add*, rather than pouring it out on the ground where it could be covered over with dust,
\v 8 \add so it makes me angry enough to\add* exact vengeance: I placed \em her\em* blood on the smooth rock so it couldn’t be covered.
\p
\v 9 Therefore, the master Yahweh says this: The city of blood \add won’t end well\add*. I will also enlarge the pile of \add fire\add*wood \add to put underneath it\add*.
\v 10 \add Stack up\add* the wood and kindle the fire. \add Cook the meat well\add* and mix in the spices and let the bones be charred.
\v 11 Then put the empty pot onto \add the hot\add* coals in order to heat and scorch its bronze, so the impurities in it will be melted—its corrosion \add eaten away\add*.’
\v 12 \add That was a lot of work, yet\add* the corrosion wasn’t removed from her by the fire.
\v 13 Your shameful behaviour is in your uncleanness. Because I tried to cleanse you but you wouldn’t \add accept it\add*, then you won’t be purified anymore until I have satisfied my fury upon you.
\v 14 I, Yahweh, have declared it, and I will do it. I won’t relent nor will I rest from it. \add You’ll be judged by your own ways and your own behaviour\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.”
\s1 The death of Yehezkel’s wife
\p
\v 15 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 16 “Listen, humanity’s child, I’m taking your \add cherished wife\add* from you with a plague, but you must not mourn nor weep, or let any tears \add show\add*.
\v 17 You must groan silently. Don’t \add organise\add* a funeral \add when she’s\add* dead. Put on your turban and your sandals, but don’t veil your beard, or eat the bread of men who mourn who’ve lost their wives.”
\p
\v 18 \add So\add* I spoke to the people in the morning, and then my wife died in the evening. In the morning I did what I had been commanded to do.
\v 19 Then the people asked me, “Won’t you tell us what these things mean—the \add way that you’re behaving\add*?”
\p
\v 20 “Yahweh \add gave me\add* this message,” I answered them,
\v 21 “to tell the \add Israeli people\add* that the master Yahweh says this to them: Listen, I will desecrate my sanctuary—the pride of your power, the delight of your eyes, and the yearning of your soul, and \add also\add* your sons and your daughters who you left behind \add there in Yerushalem\add* will fall by the sword.
\v 22 \add When that happens,\add* you’ll all do exactly as I have done: you won’t veil your beards, or eat the bread of mourning men,
\v 23 \add but instead\add* your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet. You won’t mourn nor weep, because you’ll all melt away \add due to your disobedience\add*, and everyone will groan for \add their relatives\add*.
\v 24 \add So\add* Yehezkel will be a sign for you, because when that time comes, you’ll all do \add exactly the same as he’s doing\add*. Then you’ll all know that I am the master Yahweh.’ ”
\p
\v 25 “But you, humanity’s child, on the day that I capture their temple, (which is their joy, their pride, and what they see and desire), and when I take away their sons and daughters,
\v 26 a refugee will come to you here on that day to give you the news.
\v 27 At that time, your mouth will be opened up to that refugee and you’ll speak \add again\add*—you’ll no longer be silent. You’ll be a sign for them so that they will know that I am Yahweh.”

\ms1 Yahweh’s judgement of nations
\mr (25:1–32:32)
\s1 Ammon’s punishment
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:\x + \xo 25:1-7: \xt Jer 49:1-6; Eze 21:28-32; Amos 1:13-15; Zeph 2:8-11.\x*
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, \add keep looking towards the Ammonites\add* and prophesy against them.
\v 3 Tell \add them\add* to listen to this messages \add because\add* this is what the master Yahweh says: Because you said, “Aha!” over my sanctuary when it was desecrated, and against the land of Yisrael when it was desolate, and against the \add kingdom\add* of Yehudah when they went into exile,
\v 4 therefore, listen: I’m giving you to a people in the east as their possession. They’ll set up camp against you and set up their tents among you. They’ll eat your fruit and drink your milk.
\v 5 I’ll make \add the Ammonite capital city\add*, Rabbah,\f + \fr 25:5 \ft Now the modern city of Amman (in Jordan) has been built on Rabbah’s ruins.\f* into a camel pasture and the people of Ammon into a resting place for flocks. Then you’ll all know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 6 Because the master Yahweh says this: You clapped your hands and stamped your feet and celebrated with all the contempt within you against the \add Israeli nation\add*,
\v 7 therefore, listen \add Ammon\add*. I’ll strike you \add down\add* and give you as plunder to the \add other\add* nations. I will cut you off from the peoples and make you perish from among the countries. I’ll destroy you, and you’ll know that I am Yahweh.’
\s1 Moab’s punishment
\p
\v 8 The master Yahweh says this, ‘Because Moab and Seir say that the \add kingdom\add* of Yehudah is \add just\add* like every other nation,\x + \xo 25:8-11: \xt Gen 19:36-37; 25:10-12; Jer 48:1-47; Amos 2:1-3; Zeph 2:8-11.\x*
\v 9 \add well\add* listen, I’ll \add destroy the border cities\add* \add protecting\add* Moab, starting with the splendour of Beyt-Yeshimot, Baal-Meon, and Kiriataim.
\v 10 \add I’ll hand them over\add* to the people of the east who’ve \add already\add* been against the Ammonites—I’ll give them up as a possession so that the Ammonites won’t be remembered among the nations.
\v 11 \add Yes,\add* I’ll perform judgements against Moab, then they’ll know that I am Yahweh.’
\s1 Edom’s punishment
\p
\v 12 The master Yahweh \add also\add* says, ‘Edom has taken vengeance against the \add kingdom\add* of Yehudah and has done wrong by doing that.\x + \xo 25:12-14: \xt Gen 25:24-34; 36:39; Jer 49:7-22; Eze 35:1-15; Jer 49:7-22; Oba 1-14; Mal 1:2-5.\x*
\v 13 Therefore, the master Yahweh says: I’ll strike Edom with my hand and destroy every person and animal there. I’ll make it a ruined, abandoned place, from Teman \add all the way\add* to Dedan—they’ll fall by the sword.
\v 14 I’ll \add use\add* my people Yisrael to place my vengeance on Edom, and they’ll \add apply\add* my anger and fury to Edom \add so\add* they’ll know my vengeance. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.’
\s1 Philistia’s punishment
\p
\v 15 The master Yahweh says this, ‘The Philistines have \add chosen\add* hateful vengeance and \add have put much effort into trying\add* to destroy \add Yehudah\add*,\x + \xo 25:15-17: \xt Yoel 3:4-8; Amos 1:6-8; Jdg 13:1; 1Sam 4:1.\x*
\v 16 So this is what the master Yahweh says: Listen, I’ll \add take action\add* against the Philistines, and I’ll cut off the Kerethites and destroy the remnant along the coast.
\v 17 I’ll take severe vengeance against them with furious acts to punish them—they’ll know that I am Yahweh, when I take my vengeance on them.’ ”

\s1 Tsor’s punishment
\p
\v 1 \add At the beginning\add* of the month in the eleventh year \add since King Yoyakin (Jehoiachin) had been taken captive\add*, Yahweh \add gave me\add* a message:\x + \xo 26:1–28:19: \xt Yoel 3:4-8; Amos 1:9-10.\x*
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, because Tsor \add (Tyre)\add* has said against Yerushalem, ‘\add Nice one\add*! \add Yerushalem’s\add* gates are broken. \add It’s going my way—I can take advantage\add* because it’s been destroyed.’
\p
\v 3 Therefore the master Yahweh says this: ‘Listen, I’m opposed to you, Tsor, and I’ll raise up many nations against you just like the sea raises its waves.
\v 4 They’ll destroy Tsor’s walls and tear down its towers, then I’ll sweep its dust away and make it like a bare rock.
\v 5 It’ll become a place in the middle of the sea for \add people to\add* spread their nets \add out to dry them\add*, since I’ve declared it and it’ll become plunder for the nations. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 6 Its \add young women\add* who are in the countryside will be slaughtered by the swords, and then they’ll know that I am Yahweh.’
\p
\v 7 \add Yes,\add* this is what Yahweh says: Listen, I’m bringing the Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar, king of kings from the north, against Tsor, with horses and chariots, and with horsemen and a \add large army\add*.
\v 8 He’ll kill your daughters in the countryside. He’ll set up a siege program and build a ramp against your walls and raise up shields against you.
\v 9 He’ll use his battering rams to \add smash down\add* your walls, and he’ll tear down your towers with his axes.
\v 10 \add They’ll have\add* so many horses that their dust will cover you. Your walls will shake with the noise of \add their\add* horsemen, wagons, and chariots. When he \add rides through\add* your gates, he’ll \add pick his way over the stones\add* like men do when entering a city whose walls have been broken down.
\v 11 The hooves of his horses will trample all of your streets. He’ll slaughter your people with the sword and your mighty stone pillars will \add be knocked\add* to the ground.
\v 12 They’ll tear down your walls and destroy your nice homes—plundering your riches and looting your merchandise. Then they’ll throw your \add building\add* stones, wood, and rubble into the \add ocean\add*.
\v 13 I’ll stop the sound of your songs and the \add music\add* from your harps won’t be heard anymore.
\v 14 I’ll make you \add back into\add* a bare rock—you’ll become a place where nets are spread \add out to dry\add*. You’ll never be built again, because I, master Yahweh have spoken. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p
\v 15 The master Yahweh says this to Tsor, ‘Won’t the islands shake with the sound of your downfall, and with the groans of the wounded when the terrible slaughter is happening in you?
\v 16 Then all the \add leaders of the coastal kingdoms\add* will step down from their thrones and remove their robes and take off their embroidered clothes. \add Instead,\add* they’ll clothe themselves with trembling, they’ll sit on the ground and tremble every moment, and they’ll be appalled because of you.
\v 17 Then they’ll \add sing this song of mourning\add* for you: and say to you,

\v 20 then I’ll take you down to the pit that people of ancient times went down to, because I’ll make you live in the lowest realms of the earth as in ruins of ancient times. Because of that, you won’t come back and \add be splendid\add* in the land of the living.

\v 22 Tell \add them\add* that the master Yahweh says this: ‘Listen, I’m against you, Tsidon, because I \add intend to\add* be \add praised by you\add* so your people will know that I am Yahweh when I execute justice within you and demonstrate my holiness to you.

\s1 The blessing for Yisrael
\q1
\v 24 Then there’ll no longer be pricking briars and painful thorns for the \add Israeli people\add* from all those around her who despise her, so then they’ll know that I am the master Yahweh.’
\p
\v 25 The master Yahweh says that when I gather the \add Jewish people\add* from the \add nations\add* that they were scattered among, and when I am \add properly honoured by\add* them so the nations may see, then they’ll make their homes in the land I gave to my servant Yakov \add (Jacob)\add*.

\v 2 “Humanity’s child, \add stand firmly\add* against Egypt’s king Far-oh \add (Pharaoh)\add*. Prophesy against him and against all of Egypt
\v 3 telling \add them\add* that the master Yahweh says this: Listen, I’m against you, Far-oh, king of Egypt—you, the great sea monster that lurks in the middle of the river, who then says, “My river is my own. I’ve made it for myself.”
\v 4 I’ll put hooks into your jaw, and the fish from your streams will cling to the scales on your \add side\add*. I’ll lift you up from the middle of your river along with all the fish of the river that cling to your scales.
\v 5 I’ll fling you into the wilderness—you and all the fish from your river. You’ll fall on the open countryside—\add your corpse\add* won’t be taken nor lifted up, \add but rather\add* I’ll give you as food to the birds and wild animals.
\v 6 Then all the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh, because they’ve been \add like a brittle\add* reed to the \add kingdom\add* of Yisrael.\x + \xo 29:6: \xt Isa 36:6.\x*
\v 7 When \add Yisrael\add* \add grabbed you\add*, you broke and tore open their shoulder, and when they leaned on you, you broke and made their legs unsteady.
\v 8 Therefore the master Yahweh says this: Listen, I’ll send \add an army\add* against you—both animals and people will be cut down.
\v 9 and Egypt will become desolate and a ruin. Then they’ll know that I am Yahweh.
\p Because the sea monster had said, “The river is mine, because I made it,”
\v 10 then listen: I’m against you and against your river, so I will give Egypt over to desolation and waste, and you’ll become a wasteland from the Migdol to Seveen and the borders of Kush.
\v 11 No person or domestic animal will pass through it and it won’t be inhabited for forty years.
\v 12 I’ll make Egypt a desolation in the middle of uninhabited lands, and its cities will become a desolation in the middle of wasted cities for forty years, then I’ll scatter \add the Egyptian people\add* among the nations, and I’ll disperse them through the lands.
\p
\v 13 \add But\add* the master Yahweh says this: At the end of forty years I’ll gather Egypt from the peoples that they were scattered among,
\v 14 and I’ll restore the fortunes of Egypt and bring them back to the region of Patros, to the land of their origin. Then they’ll become a lowly kingdom there.
\v 15 It’ll be the lowliest of the kingdoms, and it won’t \add become prominent\add* again among the nations. I’ll diminish them so that they’ll no longer \add dominate\add* \add other\add* nations.
\v 16 \add Requesting help from\add* \add Egypt\add* will no longer be a reason for the \add kingdom\add* of Yisrael to be confident, instead, \add Egypt\add* will be a reminder of Yisrael’s \add disobedience\add* when they turned to \add Egypt\add* for help.

\v 20 I’ve given him the land of Egypt as the wages for the work they did for me. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.

\s1 Egypt gets compared to fallen Assyria
\p
\v 1 \add At the end of June\add* in the eleventh year \add since King Yoyakin (Jehoiachin) had been taken captive\add*,\f + \fr 31:1 \ft 587 B.C.\f* Yahweh \add gave me\add* a message:
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, \add ask\add* the Egyptian king Far-oh \add (Pharaoh)\add* and his multitudes around him, ‘\add Who else is as powerful as you and your people\add*?
\v 3 Listen, Assyria was \add like\add* a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful branches, giving shade to the forest—extremely tall and the branches formed its treetop.
\v 4 \add A deep water supply\add* made it grow tall. Rivers flowed all around its area, because their channels stretched out to all the trees in the countryside.
\v 5 It \add grew taller\add* than any of the other trees in the countryside, and its branches grew long and \add thick\add* because of \add having plenty of\add* water in its shoots.
\v 6 Every \add kind of\add* bird nested in its branches, while every living thing in the countryside gave birth to its young under the foliage of that tree. All the powerful nations lived under its shade.
\v 7 It was beautiful in its greatness and due to the length of its branches, because its roots \add had access to\add* many waters.
\v 8 Cedar trees in God’s garden couldn’t equal it. None of the cypress trees matched its branches, nor could its branches be equalled by the plane tree. There was no other tree in God’s garden could compare to its beauty.\x + \xo 31:8: \xt Gen 2:9.\x*
\v 9 I made it beautiful with its many branches and all the trees in God’s garden in Eden envied it.
\p
\v 10 Therefore the master Yahweh says this: Because it was so tall, and it set its treetop between its branches, and \add because\add* it \add grew proud\add* of its height,
\v 11 I \add handed it over to\add* a powerful nation to deal with it according to what its wickedness deserves. I’ve thrown it out
\v 12 and foreigners who were the terror of all the nations cut it off and left it to die. Its branches fell onto the mountains and all the valleys, and lay broken in all the ravines of the land. Then all the nations on earth came out from under its shade and went away from it.
\v 13 All the \add various kinds of\add* birds rested on the trunk of the fallen tree, and every \add kind of\add* animal in the countryside came to its branches.
\v 14 That happened so that no other trees that grow by the waters will raise up their foliage to the height of the tallest trees, and that no other trees that grow beside the waters will reach up to that height. All of them have been assigned to death, to the earth below, among humanity’s children, with those that go down to the pit.
\p
\v 15 The master Yahweh says this: On the day when the cedar went down to \add the place of the dead\add*, I brought mourning to the earth. I covered the deep waters over it, and I held back the oceans. I held back the great waters, and I brought mourning to Lebanon for it. So all the trees in the countryside mourned because of it.
\v 16 I brought shuddering to the nations at the sound of its downfall, when I threw it down to \add the place of the dead\add*, along with those who went down into the pit. So I comforted all the trees from Eden in the lowest parts of the earth. Those had been the choicest and best trees of Lebanon—the trees that drank the waters.
\v 17 They also went down with \add the big tree\add* to \add the place of the dead\add*, to the ones who had been killed by the sword. Those were its strong arm—those nations who had lived in its shade.
\p
\v 18 \add Egypt,\add* which of the trees in Eden was your equal in glory and greatness, because you’ll be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lowest parts of the earth among the uncircumcised? You’ll live there with those who were killed by the sword.’

\v 9 I’ll disturb the heart of many peoples in lands that you don’t know \add about\add*,

\p
\v 11 \add Yes,\add* the master Yahweh says this \add to you Egypt\add*:
\q1 The Babylonian king’s sword will come against you.
\q1
\v 12 I’ll cause large numbers of you to fall by warriors’ swords—each warrior a terror of nations.
\q1 Those warriors will devastate the pride of Egypt and destroy all its \add many people\add*.
\q1
\v 13 I’ll destroy all the livestock from beside the plentiful waters.
\q1 No human foot will stir the waters up again,
\q1 nor will cattle hooves disturb them.
\q1
\v 14 Then I’ll calm their waters and make their rivers run like oil.
\q1 That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.

\ms1 The promise of God of his people
\mr (33:1–37:27)
\s1 Yehezkel as Yisrael’s watchman
\r (Eze. 3:16-21)
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, tell this to your people: ‘When I \add send an army\add* against any \add country\add*, then the people of that \add country choose one of their men to become\add* a watchman for them.
\v 3 He looks for \add any attacker coming onto\add* the land, and then he blows his horn to warn the people.
\v 4 If the people hear the sound of the horn but don’t \add take any notice\add*, and if the \add attacker\add* comes and kills them, then each one’s blood is on their own head.
\v 5 \add Yes,\add* if someone heard the horn \add but paid no attention\add*, \add that person’s\add* blood is on them, \add but\add* if \add those people\add* \add do pay attention\add*, they’ll save their own lives.
\v 6 \add However,\add* if the watchman sees the \add attacker\add* coming, \add but\add* doesn’t blow the horn, \add i.e., if\add* the people weren’t warned, and if the \add attacker approaches\add* and takes anyone’s life, then that person dies in their own sin, \add but\add* I’ll require their blood from the watchman.’
\p
\v 7 Now, \add talking to\add* you, humanity’s child: I’ve made you a watchman for the \add Israeli people\add*. You’ll hear the words from my mouth and then warn them on my behalf.
\v 8 If I say to a wicked person, ‘Wicked one, you’re certainly about to die.’ but if you don’t announce it so as to warn that wicked \add person\add* about their behaviour, then that wicked \add person\add* will die in their sin, but \add it’ll be you that I hold responsible for their death\add*.
\v 9 \add But\add* if you warn the wicked person about their behaviour, so that they might turn back from it, and if that person doesn’t turn back from their way, then they’ll die in their sin, but you yourself will have saved your own life.
\s1 Each person is responsible for their own deeds
\p
\v 10 \add So\add* humanity’s child, you tell the \add Israeli people\add*, ‘You are saying this, “Our errors and our disobedience \add have come back on us and they’re hurting\add* us. How can we go on living \add like this\add*?” ’
\v 11 Tell them that this is the master Yahweh’s declaration: ‘As I live, I don’t delight in the death of the wicked, because if the wicked repent from their ways, then they’ll live! \add So turn back\add*, \add yes\add* turn around from your wicked ways, because why should you \add Israeli people\add* die?’
\p
\v 12 \add So now\add*, humanity’s child, you tell your people, ‘The righteousness of righteous people won’t save them if they sin. The wickedness of wicked people won’t cause them to perish if they repent from their sin. \add No,\add* the righteous person won’t be able to live because of his righteousness if he sins.
\v 13 If I say that a righteous person will surely live, and if they trust in their righteousness and then commits injustice, I won’t call to mind any of \add the good things they did\add*—that person will die for the wickedness they committed.
\v 14 \add Again,\add* if I say to the wicked, “You will surely die,” but if they then repent from their sins and do what’s just and right,
\v 15 \add like\add* returning loan guarantees that were wickedly demanded, or \add like\add* making restitution for what they’ve stolen, and then if they \add obey the instructions\add* that give life and no longer \add disobey\add*, then \add those formerly wicked people\add* will surely live—they won’t die.
\v 16 None of the sins that they’ve committed will be called to mind against them. Those who’ve acted justly and rightly, will certainly live.
\p
\v 17 But your people say, “The master’s way isn’t fair!” but it is your ways that aren’t fair.
\v 18 When the righteous \add person\add* turns away from \add doing what is right\add* and \add disobeys\add*, then they’ll will die in \add their sin\add*.
\v 19 When the wicked \add person\add* turns away from \add doing evil\add* and does what is just and right, they’ll live because of those things.
\v 20 \add Yes,\add* you people say, “The master’s way isn’t fair!” \add but\add* I’ll judge each of you \add Israeli people\add* according to \add your behaviour\add*.”

\s1 More desolation to come
\p
\v 23 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 24 “Humanity’s child, the ones inhabiting those ruins \add back\add* in Yisrael \add (Israel)\add* are saying, ‘Abraham was only one person, and he inherited the land, \add but there’s lots of us\add* \add now\add*. The land has been given to us as an inheritance.’
\p
\v 25 Therefore tell them that the master Yahweh says this: You eat blood, and you \add pay your respect to\add* your idols, then you pour out people’s blood. Should you then inherit that land?
\v 26 You all \add rely\add* on your swords \add for protection\add*, and you’ve all done disgusting things—each man defiles his neighbour’s wife. Should you \add really\add* possess that land?’
\p
\v 27 Tell them that the master Yahweh says this: As I live, surely the ones in the ruins will fall by the sword, and I will give those in the countryside to the \add wild animals\add* as food, and those in fortresses and in caves will die of plagues.
\v 28 Then I will turn the \add country\add* into a desolation and a horror, and the pride \add that came from its power\add* will end, because Yisrael’s mountains will be deserted, and there’ll be no one to \add walk\add* through them.’
\v 29 Then they’ll know that I am Yahweh, when I make the \add country\add* a desolation and a wasteland because of all the \add disgusting things\add* that they’ve done.
\s1 Listening but not obeying
\p
\v 30 So now humanity’s child, your people are out beside the walls and the gates of their houses talking about you, and they’re all telling each other, ‘Let’s go and listen to the prophet’s message that comes from Yahweh.’
\v 31 So my people will come to you, as they often do, and will sit in front of you and listen to your words, but they won’t obey them. The right words are \add on their lips\add*, but their hearts are going after unjust profit.
\v 32 \add Yes,\add* you’re like a lovely song to them, a beautiful sound that is well played on a stringed instrument, so they’ll listen to your words, but none of them will obey them.
\v 33 So when all of that happens, watch out \add because it will indeed\add* happen. Then they’ll \add realise\add* that a prophet has been among them.”
\c 34
\s1 The ‘shepherds’ of Yisrael (Israel)
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, prophesy against Yisrael’s shepherds. Prophesy and tell them that the master Yahweh says this to the shepherds: Yisrael’s shepherds who are shepherding themselves \add won’t end well\add*. Shouldn’t shepherds guard the flock?
\v 3 You eat the \add best sheep meat\add* and dress in \add woollen clothes\add*. You slaughter the \add fat lambs\add*. You don’t shepherd at all.
\v 4 You haven’t \add taken care of those\add* with diseases, nor do you heal those who are ill. You don’t bandage up the ones \add with broken limbs\add*, and you don’t restore the outcasts or \add search for those who’ve gone missing\add*. Instead, you use strength and violence to rule over them.
\v 5 Then they were scattered without a shepherd, and after they were scattered, they became food for all the \add wild animals\add* in the countryside.\x + \xo 34:5: \xt Num 27:17; 1Ki 22:17; Mat 9:36; Mrk 6:34.\x*
\v 6 My flock have strayed across all the mountains and on every high hill, and it’s dispersed over the entire surface of the earth, yet no one is searching for them.
\p
\v 7 Therefore, you shepherds, listen to Yahweh’s message \add to you\add*:
\v 8 This is the master Yahweh’s declaration: As I live, my flock has become plunder and food for all the wild animals in the countryside because there wasn’t any shepherd and \add because\add* none of my shepherds \add tried to find any of\add* my flock \add that had gotten lost\add*. \add Instead it was themselves that\add* the shepherds looked after, and they didn’t shepherd my flock.
\v 9 Therefore, \add you ‘so-called’\add* shepherds, liste to Yahweh’s message:
\v 10 The Lord Yahweh says this: Listen, I’m against those shepherds. I’ll require \add compensation from them for\add* my flock, and then I’ll dismiss them from shepherding the flock. Those shepherds won’t shepherd themselves any longer \add either\add*, \add because\add* I’ll take my flock away from their mouths, so that my flock won’t become food for them any longer.
\s1 The evil shepherds
\p
\v 11 \add So\add* the master Yahweh says this: Listen, I myself will search for \add those lost from\add* my flock, and I \add myself\add* will look after them,
\v 12 like a shepherd searches for his sheep when he’s among his scattered flock. Thus I’ll look for my flock and I’ll rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on the day of clouds and darkness.
\v 13 \add So\add* I’ll bring \add my people\add* out from among the \add nations\add*. I’ll gather them from \add foreign\add* lands and bring them \add back\add* to their land. I’ll put them in pastures on Yisrael’s mountainsides, by the streams, and in every settlement in the land.
\v 14 I’ll put them in good pastures—Yisrael’s high mountains will be their grazing places. They’ll lie down there in places good for grazing, in abundant pastures, and they’ll graze on Yisrael’s hills.
\v 15 I myself will shepherd my flock, and I myself will make them lie down. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p
\v 16 I’ll search out the lost and restore the outcast. I’ll bandage up those who are broken and heal those who are sick, but I’ll destroy those who are fat and well. I will shepherd with justice.
\p
\v 17 So now this is what the master Yahweh says, You my flock, listen, I’ll be a judge between one sheep and another, and between rams and billy goats.
\v 18 Isn’t it enough to feed on the good pasture, that you must trample down \add any remaining grass\add* with your feet? Or to drink from clear waters, then muddying the streams with your feet?
\v 19 Must my flock eat what you’ve trampled with your feet, and drink what you have muddied with your feet?
\p
\v 20 Therefore the master Yahweh says this to them: Listen, I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the thin ones,
\v 21 because you \add shepherds\add* have pushed them with your sides and shoulders, and you’ve gored all the weak ones with your horns until you all \add succeeded in\add* scattering them away from the land.
\v 22 I’ll save my flock and they’ll no longer be \add taken as\add* plunder, and I will judge between one sheep and \add the next\add*.
\v 23 I’ll set one shepherd over them—my servant David. He’ll \add look after\add* them, and he’ll be their shepherd.\x + \xo 34:23: \xt Rev 7:17.\x*
\v 24 Then I, Yahweh, will be their God, and my servant David will be a leader among them. I, Yahweh, have declared that.\x + \xo 34:24: \xt Eze 37:24.\x*
\p
\v 25 Then I’ll make a peace treaty with them and remove the wild animals from the land, so that they’ll \add be able to\add* live securely in the wilderness and sleep safely in the forests.
\p
\v 26 I will also \add bless\add* \add both\add* them and on the places around my hill, and send out showers in due season—they’ll be showers of blessing.
\v 27 Then the trees in the countryside will produce their fruit, the soil will yield its produce, and my sheep will be secure in their land. When I break \add off the ties holding the yoke\add* \add onto their necks\add*, and when I rescue them from the \add control\add* of those who enslaved them, then they’ll know that I am Yahweh.
\v 28 They’ll no longer be plunder for the \add other\add* nations, and the wild animals on the land will no longer devour them. Then they’ll live securely, and no one will \add make them afraid\add*.
\v 29 I’ll provide a land for them that’s known for its crops so they won’t be victims of famine, and they won’t be \add mocked by\add* \add other\add* nations.
\v 30 Then they’ll know that I, Yahweh their God, am with them. The \add Israeli people\add* are my people. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p
\v 31 You are my sheep, the flock of my pasture, and my people, and I am your God. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.’ ”

\s1 Edom’s coming punishment
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:\x + \xo 35:1-15: \xt Isa 34:5-17; 63:1-6; Jer 49:7-22; Eze 25:12-14; Amos 1:11-12; Oba 1-14; Mal 1:2-5.\x*
\v 2 “Humanity’s child, \add look out towards\add* Mt. Seir and prophesy against it.
\v 3 Tell it that the master Yahweh says this: Listen, I’m against you \add Edom, represented by\add* Mt. Seir, and I’ll \add work against you to\add* make you a desolation and a waste.
\v 4 I’ll \add turn\add* your cities into ruins, and you yourself will become desolate. Then you’ll know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 5 You’ve always been hostile to the Israeli people, and in their time of distress you \add decided to attack them with swords\add*—at the time their punishment was coming to an end.
\v 6 Therefore, this is the master Yahweh’s declaration: As I live, I will prepare you for bloodshed, and bloodshed will chase after you. Since you didn’t hate bloodshed, then bloodshed will \add come to you\add* you.
\v 7 I’ll make \add Edom\add* completely desolate when I cut \add it off so that no one will want to pass through it\add*.
\v 8 I’ll fill its mountain \add ranges\add* with those who were killed—those killed by the sword will fall on your high hills and valleys and in all your streams.
\v 9 I’ll make \add your land perpetually desolate\add*. Your cities won’t be inhabited, and then you’ll know that I am Yahweh.
\p
\v 10 You’ve said, “These two nations and these two lands will become mine, and we will possess them,” even when Yahweh was there with them.
\v 11 Therefore, this is the master Yahweh’s declaration: As I live, so I will do according to your anger and according to your jealousy that you had in your hatred of Yisrael, and I will show myself to them when I judge you
\v 12 then you will know that I am Yahweh. I’ve heard all the insults you spoke against Yisrael’s \add hill country\add*, when you said, “They’ve been destroyed—they’ve been given over to us to devour.”
\v 13 You raised yourselves up against me with what you said, and you multiplied the words you said against me, and I heard all of them.
\p
\v 14 The master Yahweh says this: I’ll make you \add into a desolate place\add* while the \add rest of the world cheers\add*.
\v 15 Just like you rejoiced over the inheritance of Israeli people \add when it was made desolate\add*, I’ll do the same to you. You’ll become a desolation, Mt. Seir and all of Edom—all of it. Then they’ll know that I am Yahweh.”
\c 36
\s1 God’s blessing for Yisrael (Israel)
\p
\v 1 “Now humanity’s child, prophesy to Yisrael’s mountains and say, ‘Mountains of Yisrael, listen to Yahweh’s message.
\v 2 The master Yahweh says this: The enemy has said, “Aha,” \add when talking\add* about you, and “The ancient \add hilltop shrines\add* have become ours.” ’
\p
\v 3 Therefore prophesy and tell them that the master Yahweh says this: Because of your desolation and because of the attacks that came on you from all sides, you’ve \add ended up as\add* a possession of the other nations—you’ve been the subject of slanderous lips and tongues, and of people’s stories.
\v 4 Therefore, mountains of Yisrael, listen to the message from the master Yahweh: The master Yahweh says this to the mountains and the high hills, to the streambeds and valleys, to the \add places that have been destroyed and are now uninhabited\add*, and to the forsaken cities that have become plunder and a subject of mocking for the other nations that surround them—
\v 5 therefore the master Yahweh says this: I have certainly spoken in the fire of my fury against the other nations, against Edom and everyone who took my land for themselves as a possession—against all those who had both celebration in their heart and disdain in their spirit as they seized my land so they could claim its pasturelands for themselves.’
\p
\v 6 Therefore, prophesy to Yisrael and tell the mountains and the high hills, the streambeds and the valleys, that the master Yahweh says this: Listen, in my fury and in my anger I am declaring this because you have endured insults from \add other\add* nations.
\v 7 Therefore, the master Yahweh says this: I myself will \add take action and promise\add* that the nations that surround you will certainly \add be made to\add* carry their own shame.
\v 8 But you Israeli mountains, you’ll grow branches and bear fruit for my Israeli people, since they’ll soon come back to you
\v 9 because, listen, I’m for you, and I’ll treat you favourably—you will be ploughed and sown \add with seed\add*.
\v 10 I’ll multiply \add your population\add*, even \add all the people\add* of Yisrael. The cities will be inhabited \add again\add* and the ruins rebuilt.
\v 11 I’ll increase \add both\add* people and animals on you \add mountains\add* so that they’ll multiply and be fruitful. Then I’ll cause you to be inhabited like you were previously, and I’ll make you prosper more than you did in the past \add so that\add* you’ll know that I am Yahweh.
\v 12 I’ll bring my Israeli people to walk on you. They’ll possess you, and you’ll be their inheritance, and you’ll no longer cause their children to die.
\p
\v 13 The master Yahweh says this: Because they’re telling you, “You \add mountains\add* devour men, bereaving your nation of children,”
\v 14 therefore you won’t consume people any longer, and you’ll no longer make your nation mourn their deaths. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 15 I won’t allow you to hear the insults from the \add other\add* nations any longer—you’ll no longer have to bear the shame of the peoples or cause your nation to fall. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.”
\p
\v 16 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 17 “Humanity’s child, when the \add Israeli people\add* inhabited their land, they defiled it with their ways and their activities. \add In my eyes,\add* their ways were like the uncleanness of a woman’s menstruation,
\v 18 \add so\add* I poured out my fury against them for the blood that they had poured out on the land, and for how they’d polluted it with their idols.
\v 19 I scattered them among the nations—they were dispersed through the lands. I judged them according to their ways and their actions.
\v 20 Then they went to those \add other\add* nations, and wherever they went, they profaned my holy name when people asked about them, ‘Are these really Yahweh’s people, because they’ve been thrown out of his land?’
\v 21 \add But\add* I had compassion for my holy name that the \add Israeli people\add* had defiled among the \add other\add* nations, when they went there.
\p
\v 22 Therefore tell the \add Israeli people\add* that the master Yahweh says this: I’m not doing this for the sake of you \add Israeli people\add*, but for my sacred name which you have profaned among the nations everywhere you’ve gone.
\v 23 My great name which you’ve all profaned among the nations, I will make holy \add even\add* among the nations \add where\add* you profaned it. Then the nations will know that I am Yahweh when they see you all recognise my holiness. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 24 I’ll take you all \add back\add* out of those nations and gather you from every land, and I’ll bring you into your land.
\v 25 Then I’ll sprinkle pure water on you all so you’ll be cleaned from all of your impurities, and I’ll purify you from all your idols.
\v 26 I’ll give you \add people\add* a new heart and a new spirit in your innermost parts, and I’ll take the stony heart away from your \add bodies\add* and \add replace it with\add* a heart of flesh.\x + \xo 36:26-28: \xt Eze 11:19-20.\x*
\v 27 I’ll put my spirit in you and enable you all to \add follow my instructions and keep my regulations\add*.
\v 28 Then you’ll all inhabit the land that I gave to your ancestors—you’ll be my people and I’cll be your God.
\v 29 I’ll save you from all of your uncleanness, and then I’ll summon the grain and multiply it—I’ll no longer \add assign\add* famine to you all.
\v 30 I’ll multiply the \add fruits on the trees\add* and the produce \add from the soil\add* so that you’ll all no longer \add be shamed when other nations observe you suffering\add* famine.
\v 31 Then you’ll all think about your wicked ways and your activities that weren’t good, and \add your faces will display your loathing of your own sins and your disgusting habits\add*.
\v 32 But make sure that you all know this: I’m not doing all that for \em your\em* sake, \add so you Israeli people\add* should be ashamed and disgraced because of your \add behaviour\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p
\v 33 The master Yahweh says this: \add When\add* I purify you from all your disobedience, I’ll enable you all to inhabit the cities \add again\add* and to rebuild the ruined places,
\v 34 and the idle land will be tilled until it is no longer a wasteland for everyone to see as they go past.
\v 35 Then \add instead\add* they’ll say, “This land was desolate, but it’s become like the garden of Eden—the abandoned cities and the uninhabited ruins that were torn down, are now fortified and inhabited.”
\v 36 Then the other nations around you all will know that I am Yahweh, because I built up the ruins and replanted the abandoned places. I, Yahweh, have declared it and I will do it.
\p
\v 37 The master Yahweh \add also\add* says this: Again I will be asked by the \add Israeli people\add* to do this for them: to increase \add their population like sheep\add*.
\v 38 Just like the flock \add that’s kept separate to be used\add* for sacrifices (like the flock in Yerushalem at her scheduled feasts), so too the ruined cities will be filled with flocks of people and they will know that I am Yahweh.”
\c 37
\s1 The valley with bleached bones
\p
\v 1 \add One day Yahweh gave me another vision\add*, and he took me out by his spirit and set me down in the middle of a valley that was full of bones.
\v 2 Then he led me all around them, and wow, there were so many bones in the valley, and they were totally dried out!
\v 3 “Humanity’s child,” he \add asked\add* me, “can these bones can become living \add people\add* again?”
\p “My master Yahweh,” I \add replied\add*, “\add only you would know that\add*.”
\p
\v 4 Then he told me, “Prophesy over these bones and tell them, ‘Dry bones. Listen to Yahweh’s message.
\v 5 The master Yahweh says this to these bones: Listen, I’m about to put breath into you all, and you’ll live.
\v 6 I’ll \add connect\add* sinews to you and put flesh onto you. I’ll cover you all with skin and put breath into you so you’ll live. Then you’ll all know that I am Yahweh.’ ”
\p
\v 7 So I prophesied as I was instructed, and wow, a sound like something rattling started as the bones moved together—bone against bone!
\v 8 I looked and, more wow, the bones now had sinews on them, and flesh grew up \add over that\add* then skin covered them! \add But\add* there was still no breath in them.
\p
\v 9 Then Yahweh told me, “Prophesy to the wind. Humanity’s child, prophesy and tell the air, ‘The master Yahweh \add commands\add* this: Breath, come from the four \add compass points\add*, and breathe into these who’ve been killed, so they’ll \add come to life\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 10 \add So\add* I prophesied just like I was commanded. Then breath came into them and they \add came to life\add*. Then they stood on their feet—a very large army.
\p
\v 11 Then Yahweh \add informed\add* me, “Humanity’s child, these bones are the entire \add Israeli population\add*. Listen, they’re saying, ‘Our bones have dried up and our hope is gone. We’ve been cut off.’
\v 12 Therefore prophesy and tell them, ‘The master Yahweh says this: Listen, I’ll open your graves and lift you out from them, my people, then I’ll bring you back to Yisrael.
\v 13 Then when I open your graves and bring you out of them, you’ll all know that I am Yahweh, my people.
\v 14 I’ll place my spirit within you all so you’ll live, and I’ll cause you to rest in your land when you know that I am Yahweh. I declare and will do it. That is Yahweh’s declaration.’ ”
\s1 The two sticks indicating unity of Yisrael and Yehudah

\v 15 Then Yahweh \add gave\add* me \add another\add* message:
\v 16 “\add So now\add*, humanity’s child, take a stick for yourself and write on it, ‘For Yehudah and for all their associated people.’ Then take another stick and write on it, ‘For \add Yisrael\add* (\add represented by\add* Yosef \add (Joseph)\add*, the branch of Efrayim), and for all their associated people.’
\v 17 Then hold both of them together so that they \add seem like\add* one stick in your hand.

\p
\v 14 Therefore humanity’s child, prophesy and tell Gog that the master Yahweh says this: On that day, when my people Yisrael are living securely, \add but you won’t take notice of that.\add*

\v 8 Listen, the day is coming and \add all that\add* will take place. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 9 Those living in Yisrael’s cities will go out and they will use \add those\add* weapons to kindle and make fires and burn them—small shields, large shields, bows, arrows, the clubs and spears—they’ll make fires with them for seven years.
\v 10 They won’t \add need to\add* gather firewood from the countryside or cut down trees from the forests, since they’ll burn the weapons. They will take from those \add invaders\add* who wanted to take from them and plunder those who wanted to plunder them. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.”
\s1 Gog’s burial
\p
\v 11 Then \add at that time\add*, I’ll make a grave for Gog there in Yisrael—a valley for those who journey to the east of the sea. They’ll bury Gog there with all his multitudes, and they’ll call it the ‘Hamon-Gog’ \add (or, ‘Gog’s horde’)\add* valley. \add That mass grave\add* will block those who wish to cross over.
\v 12 It’ll take seven months for the Israelis to bury them to make the area clean—
\v 13 all the people of the land will bury them. It will be a memorable day for them when I’m \add honoured\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 14 At the end of the seven months, they’ll designate men to continually go through the \add region\add* to find those who were travelling through, but who died and their bodies remained \add above the ground\add*, so that they can bury them to make the land clean.
\v 15 As those men pass through the land, when they see any human bone, they’ll put a marker by it, until gravediggers come and bury it in the Hamon-Gog valley.
\v 16 There’ll even be a city there named ‘Hamonah’ \add (which means, ‘horde’ or ‘multitude’)\add*. In that way, they’ll make the land clean \add again\add*.
\p
\v 17 Now humanity’s child, the master Yahweh says this to you: Tell all the winged birds and all the wild animals in the countryside, ‘Gather together and come. Gather from all around to the sacrifice that I myself am making for you—a large sacrifice on Yisrael’s mountains, so that you can eat \add human\add* flesh and drink blood.\x + \xo 39:17-20: \xt Rev 19:17-18.\x*
\v 18 You’ll all consume the flesh of warriors and drink the blood of the \add world’s leaders\add* as if they were rams, lambs, goats, and bulls that were all fattened in Bashan.
\v 19 Then you’ll eat fat until \add you’re all\add* full \add and\add* drink blood until \add you’re all\add* drunk—that will be the sacrifice that I’ll slaughter for you \add birds and animals\add*.
\v 20 You’ll all be satisfied at my table with \add horses, chariots, warriors,\add* and every man of war. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.’
\s1 Yisrael’s restoration
\p
\v 21 I will \add display my power\add* among the nations, and all the nations will see \add my judgement that I’ll put into process\add* and \add how I’ll put that into action\add* against them.
\v 22 Then from that \add time\add* onwards, the \add Israeli people\add* will know that I am their God Yahweh.
\v 23 The nations will know that the \add Israeli people\add* went into captivity because of how they betrayed me with their \add disobedience\add*, so I \add distanced myself\add* from them and \add handed them over to\add* their adversaries so that all of them \add died in the battle\add*.
\v 24 When I \add distanced myself\add* from them, I \add treated them exactly as their defilement and rebellion deserved\add*.
\p
\v 25 Therefore the master Yahweh says this: Now I’ll restore the fortunes of Yakov, and I’ll have compassion on all the \add descendants\add* of Israel, when I act with zeal \add to protect my pure reputation\add*.
\v 26 Then they’ll bear their shame and all the treason in which they betrayed me. They’ll forget all that when they rest in their land in safety, with no one to terrify them
\v 27 \add when\add* I restore them from the peoples and gather them from the lands of their enemies, and I show myself in the sight of many nations \add to always do what’s right\add*.
\v 28 Then they’ll know that I am Yahweh their God, because I sent them into captivity among the \add other\add* nations, but then I’ll gather them back to their \add own\add* land. I won’t leave any of them among the nations.
\v 29 I’ll no longer \add distance myself\add* from them when I pour out my spirit on the \add Israeli people\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.”

\ms1 The revelation concerning the coming temple and nation
\mr (40:1–48:35)
\s1 Yehezkel is taken to Yerushalem
\p
\v 1 In \add mid-April\add* of the twenty-fifth year of our captivity (the fourteenth year after \add Yerushalem\add* was captured), Yahweh \add used his power to take\add* me there,
\v 2 \add yes,\add* God took me to Israel in visions. He brought me to rest on a very high mountain \add where\add* there seemed to be city buildings towards the south\x + \xo 40:2: \xt Rev 21:10.\x*
\v 3 and he took me there. Then wow, there was a man standing in the city gateway who \add looked like\add* bronze! \add He was holding\add* a linen cord and a measuring rod.\x + \xo 40:3: \xt Rev 11:1; 21:15.\x*
\p
\v 4 The man told me, “Humanity’s child, look with your eyes and listen with your ears, and fix your mind on everything that I’m revealing to you, because you were brought here so I could reveal them to you. Report everything you see \add here\add* to the \add Israeli people\add*.”
\s1 The eastern gateway
\p
\v 5 There was a wall surrounding the temple area. The measuring rod in the man’s hand was \add just over three metres long\add*. (It was six long cubits—each long cubit was a cubit long plus a handbreadth.) \add So\add* he measured the wall, and it was one measuring rod thick and one high.\x + \xo 40:5–42:20: \xt 1Ki 6:1-38; 2Ch 3:1-9.\x*
\v 6 Then he went to the temple gate that faced east. He went up its steps and measured the gate’s threshold—one rod across.
\v 7 The guard chambers were each one rod \add long and deep, and just under three metres wide\add*. The temple gate threshold by the temple portico was one rod across.
\v 8 He measured the porch inside the gate and it was one rod long,
\v 9 and the porch over the gate was one rod deep. The doorposts were \add each\add* a metre wide. (This was the porch at the gate facing the temple.)
\v 10 There were three guard chambers on either side of the east gate, and each of them \add was the same size\add*, and the walls that separated them \add were the same size\add*.
\p
\v 11 Then the man measured the width of the gateway entrance \add and it was five metres\add* and the length of the gateway entrance \add was almost seven metres\add*.
\v 12 He measured the wall that was \add ran along\add* the front of the chambers at half a metre high. The chambers measured three metres on each side.
\v 13 Then he measured the gateway from the roof of one chamber to that of the next chamber \add and it was thirteen metres\add*, from the entrance of the first chamber to that of the second.
\v 14 Then he measured the wall that went between the guard chambers \add and it was over thirty metres long\add* as far as the gate’s porch.
\v 15 The entrance from the front of the gate to the other end of the gate’s porch was twenty-six metres.
\v 16 There were closed windows facing the chambers and toward their pillars within the gates all around, and likewise for the porches. There were windows all around the inside, and each of the door jambs was decorated with \add carvings of\add* palm trees.
\s1 The temple courtyard
\p
\v 17 Then the man brought me to the outer courtyard of the temple. Look, there were rooms, and the courtyard \add was paved\add*, with thirty rooms next to the pavement.
\v 18 The pavement \add reached\add* to the side of the gates, and its width was the same as the gates’ length. That was the lower pavement.
\v 19 Then the man measured the distance from the front of the lower gate to the front of the inner gate: it was \add just over fifty metres\add* on the eastern side, and the same on the northern side.
\s1 The northern gateway
\p
\v 20 Then he measured the length and width of the gate that was at the northern \add end\add* of the outer courtyard.
\v 21 There were three chambers on each side of that gate, and the gate and its porch measured the same as the main gate: \add twenty-seven metres long and thirteen metres wide\add*.
\v 22 Its windows, porch, chambers, and its palm trees matched the eastern gate. Seven steps went up to it and to its porch.
\v 23 There was a gate to the inner courtyard in front of the northern gate, just as there also was at the eastern gate. The man measured from one gate to the other gate \add and it was fifty-two metres\add*.
\s1 The southern gateway
\p
\v 24 Next the man took me to the gateway at the southern entrance, and its walls and porch measured the same as the other outer gates.
\v 25 There were closed windows in the gateway and its porch just \add like the other gates\add*. The southern gate and its porch \add was twenty-seven metres long and thirteen metres wide\add*.
\v 26 There were seven steps up to the gate and its porch, and \add carvings of\add* palm trees on the walls on each side.
\v 27 There was a gate to the inner courtyard on the southern side, and the man measured fifty-four metres from that gate to the gate at the southern entrance.
\s1 The gateways to the inner courtyard
\p
\v 28 Then the man brought me to the inner courtyard by way of its southern gate, which had the same measurements as the other gates.
\v 29 Its chambers, walls, and porches measured the same as the other gates—there were windows all around in the porch. The inner gate and its porch \add was twenty-seven metres long and thirteen metres wide\add*.
\v 30 There were also porches all around the inner wall—they were \add all\add* \add thirteen metres long and almost three metres wide\add*.
\v 31 The porch facing the outer courtyard had \add carved\add* palm trees on its walls, and eight steps going up to it.
\s1 The eastern gate to the inner courtyard
\p
\v 32 Then the man brought me to the inner courtyard by the eastern side and measured the gate, which had the same measurements as the other gates.
\v 33 Its chambers, walls, and porches measured the same as the other gates, and there were windows all around. The inner gate and its porch \add was twenty-seven metres long and thirteen metres wide\add*.
\v 34 Its porch \add that\add* faced the outer courtyard had \add carved\add* palm trees on each side of it, and eight steps going up it.
\s1 The northern gate to the inner courtyard
\p
\v 35 Next the man brought me to the northern gate and measured it, \add and\add* it measured the same as the other gates.
\v 36 Its chambers, walls, and porch measured the same as the other gates, and there were windows all around. The gateway and its porch \add was twenty-seven metres long and thirteen metres wide\add*.
\v 37 Its porch \add that\add* faced the outer courtyard had \add carved\add* palm trees on each side of it, and eight steps going up it.
\s1 Rooms for preparing sacrifices
\p
\v 38 There was a room with a door by each of the inner gateways which was where they rinsed the burnt offerings.
\v 39 There were two tables on each side of each porch, which were for slaughtering \add the offerings, i.e.,\add* the burnt offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering.
\v 40 By the wall of the courtyard, going up to the gate to the north, there were two tables. Also on the other side there were two tables at the gate’s porch.
\v 41 There were four tables by the gate on each side—they slaughtered animals on those eight tables.
\v 42 There were four cut-stone tables for the burnt offerings, \add each just under a metre long and width, and standing half a metre tall\add*. They kept the tools which they used to slaughter the burnt offerings for the sacrifices on those \add stone\add* tables.
\v 43 Some two-pronged hooks a handbreadth in length were fastened all around in the porch, and the flesh of the offerings would be put on the tables.
\s1 The priests’ rooms
\p
\v 44 Within the inner courtyard \add but\add* on the outside of the inner gate were singers’ chambers—one on the northern side facing south, and the other on the southern side facing north.
\v 45 Then the man told me, “This room facing south is for the priests who are on duty in the temple.
\v 46 The room facing north is for the priests on duty at the altar, i.e., for Tsadok’s descendants—they’re the \add only\add* Levites who approach Yahweh to serve him.”
\s1 The inner courtyard
\p
\v 47 Next he measured the square courtyard at 54m long and wide, with the altar in front of the temple.
\s1 The temple entrance
\p
\v 48 Then the man took me to the temple porch and measured its doorposts—they were each 2.5m thick. The entryway itself was seven metres wide,\f + \fr 40:48 \ft Following the LXX, as the 1.5m (three cubits) in the Hebrew appears likely to be a copying mistake.\f* and the walls on each side of it were 1.5m wide.
\v 49 The porch was eleven metres wide and six metres deep, \add with\add* steps going up to it and pillars standing on each side of it.
\c 41
\s1 Inside the temple
\p
\v 1 Then the man took me into the temple’s holy place and measured the doorposts \add at\add* three metres thick on each side.
\v 2 The doorway was five metres wide \add and\add* the wall on each side was 2.5m long. Then the man measured the dimensions of the holy place—twenty-one metres long and ten metres wide.
\v 3 Then the man went into the \add very sacred\add* inner place and measured the door at one metre wide, and the doorway was three metres wide. The walls on either side were nearly four metres wide.
\v 4 Then he measured the square room’s length and width of eleven metres, \add measuring\add* to the temple hallway. Then he said to me, “This is the most sacred area.”
\s1 The temple rooms
\p
\v 5 Then the man measured the wall of the house at three metres thick. The width of each side room around the house was two metres.
\v 6 There were side rooms on three levels, one room above another, thirty rooms on each level. There were ledges around the temple wall to support all the side rooms, as the supports weren’t built into the temple wall.
\v 7 So the side rooms widened and went around going up, because the house went around higher and higher all around—the rooms widened \add on each higher level\add*, and a stairway went up through the middle level to the highest level.
\v 8 Then I saw a raised part all around the temple, the foundation for the side chambers. It measured a full rod in height—\add just over three metres\add*.
\v 9 The width of the wall of the side rooms on the outside was 2.5m. There was an open space outside those rooms in the temple.
\v 10 On the other side of that open space were the priests’ outer side rooms. That space was ten metres wide all around the temple.
\v 11 There were doors into the side rooms from another open space with one doorway on the north side, and the other on the south. The width of that open area was 2.5m all around.
\s1 The western side
\p
\v 12 The building that faced the courtyard on the western side was 36m wide. Its wall was 2.5m thick all around, and it was 47m long.
\s1 The temple building measurements
\p
\v 13 Then the man measured the temple as being fifty-three metres long. The separated building, its wall, and the courtyard \add combined\add* also measured at fifty-three metres \add across\add*.
\v 14 The width of the front of the courtyard in front of the temple was also fifty-three metres.
\p
\v 15 Then the man measured the length of the building behind the temple, to its west, and including the galleries on either side came to fifty-three metres.
\p The sacred inner place and the porch,
\v 16 The inner walls and the windows, including the narrow windows, and the galleries all around on three levels, were all panelled in wood.
\v 17 Above the entryway to the inner sanctuary and spaced along the walls there was a \add repeating\add* pattern.
\v 18 It was decorated with winged creatures and palm trees—with a palm tree between each winged creature, and each winged creature had two faces:
\v 19 the human face looked toward a palm tree on one side, and the young lion face looked toward a palm tree on the other side. They were carved all around the entire temple.
\v 20 From the ground to above the doorway, winged creatures and palm trees were carved on the outer wall of the temple.
\v 21 The door posts of the \add main temple room\add* were square, all with the same appearance.
\v 22 The wooden altar was one metre on each side and stood 1.5m high. Its corner posts, base, and frame were \add all\add* made of wood.
\p Then the man said to me, “This is the table that stands \add in Yahweh’s presence\add*.”
\s1 The temple doorways
\p
\v 23 Both the main room and the sacred place had double doors—
\v 24 each consisting of two parts that swung on hinges.
\v 25 There were carvings of winged creatures and palm trees on the doors, just like on the walls, and there was a wooden roof over the front porch.
\v 26 There were narrow windows and palm trees on either side of the porch like the side rooms of the temple, and they also had overhanging roofs.
\c 42
\s1 Two buildings near the temple
\p
\v 1 Next the man sent me out to the outer courtyard on the northern side, and he brought me to rooms in front of the outer courtyard and the northern outer wall.
\v 2 That building with a north-facing entrance was fifty-four metres long and twenty-seven metres wide.
\v 3 Some of those rooms faced the inner courtyard and were eleven metres away from the sanctuary. There were three levels of rooms, and the ones above looked down on the ones below and were open to them, having a walkway. Some of the rooms looked out onto the outer courtyard.
\v 4 A five metre wide passage ran in front of the rooms and was fifty-four\f + \fr 42:4 \ft The Hebrew text seemed to be missing a word here (as it didn’t make sense), so the word from the (approx. 300 B.C.) Septuagint translation was used.\f* metres long. The rooms’ doors \add faced\add* north.
\v 5 But the upper halls were smaller, because the walkways \add there used\add* more space than they did in the bottom and middle levels of the building.
\v 6 \add The third storey halls\add* had no pillars (unlike the courtyards), so \add the rooms at the highest level\add* were smaller than those on the bottom and middle levels.
\v 7 The outside wall ran along the rooms toward the outer courtyard that was in front of the rooms \add and\add* was twenty-seven metres long.
\v 8 The \add row of\add* rooms along the outer courtyard was twenty-seven metres long, and the \add row of\add* rooms facing the sanctuary was fifty-four metres long.
\v 9 There was an entrance to the lowest rooms from the eastern side, coming from the outer courtyard.
\v 10 There was \add also a set of\add* rooms along the outer courtyard wall on the eastern side of the outer courtyard, in front of the sanctuary’s inner courtyard
\v 11 with a walkway in front of them. They \add looked similar to\add* the rooms on the northern side and had the same \add measurements\add*, as well as the same exits and arrangements and doors.
\v 12 There were also doorways into rooms on the south side that were similar to what was on the north side. There was an inside passage with an outer door—the passage had doors into all the rooms. At the eastern end of the passage there was a door from the outside.
\p
\v 13 Then the man told me, “The northern rooms and the southern rooms that are in front of the outer courtyard are sacred rooms where the priests who work nearest to Yahweh may eat the very sacred food. They will put the very sacred things there—the food offering, the sin offering, and the guilt offering—because it’s a very sacred area.
\v 14 When the priests enter it, they must not go \add back\add* out of the sacred area to the outer court, without laying aside the clothes in which they served, since those \add clothes\add* are sacred. So they must dress in other clothes before going \add back into the public areas\add*.”
\s1 Measuring outside the temple
\p
\v 15 The man completed measuring the temple interior and then took me out to the eastern gate and measured all the surrounding area there.
\v 16-19 He measured each side \add of the wall\add* with \add his\add* measuring rod \add and it was\add* 270m\f + \fr 42:16 \ft Following the Septuagint here, which seems more accurate (unless he now has a shorter measuring rod).\f* long on each of the eastern, northern, southern, and western side.
\v 20 \add So\add* the four sides that were measured (and thus the wall around it) was 270m on each side, and the wall separated the sacred area from the \add public area\add*.
\c 43
\s1 The powerful splendour of God there to temple
\p
\v 1 Then the man took me to the gate that opened to the east.
\v 2 Wow! The splendour of Yisrael’s God \add appeared to\add* the east. His voice was like the \add roar of rushing water\add*, and the land shone with his \add brilliance\add*.\x + \xo 43:2: \xt Eze 10:3-4,18-19; 11:22-23; Rev 1:15.\x*
\v 3 \add What I saw in this vision was like what I had seen in my earlier\add* visions, first by the Kevar Canal, then later when he\f + \fr 43:3 \ft It’s only one letter difference, but the Hebrew has ‘I’ here which seems wrong and is adjusted in some later manuscripts.\f* came to destroy \add Yerushalem\add*. I fell to \add my knees with\add* my face \add to the ground\add*.
\v 4 \add So\add* Yahweh’s \add brightness\add* entered into the temple via the eastern entrance.
\p
\v 5 Then the spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court, and wow, Yahweh’s brilliance was filling the temple.
\v 6 Then as the man was standing \add there\add* beside me, I heard someone speak to me from inside the temple
\v 7 and \add the voice\add* told me, “Humanity’s child, this is the place \add where I’ll sit on\add* my throne and \add rest\add* my feet—where I’ll live in the middle of the Israeli people forever. Yisrael’s \add descendants\add* and their kings will no longer profane my sacred name with their faithlessness or with the corpses of their kings at their \add hilltop shrines\add*.
\v 8 They’ll no longer profane my sacred name by putting their \add entrance\add* next to my \add entrance\add*, and their doorposts next to my doorposts, with nothing but a wall between me and them. They profaned my sacred name with their disgusting actions, so I \add destroyed\add* them with my anger.
\v 9 Now let them remove their prostitution and \add their kings’ corpses\add* from before me, and I will live \add among them\add* forever.
\p
\v 10 “Humanity’s child, \add describe that temple to the Israeli people\add* so they’ll be ashamed of their \add disobedience\add* and \add consider those plans\add*.
\v 11 If they are ashamed of everything they’ve done, then reveal the design of that temple to them—its details, its entrances and exits, and all its designs, all its decrees and rules. Then \add right\add* \add in front of them,\add* write that down so they will keep to all its design and all its rules, and then obey them.
\v 12 This is the regulation for the temple: From the peak of the hill to all the surrounding border around it, it will be very sacred. Listen, that’s the regulation for the temple.
\s1 The altar dimensions
\p
\v 13 These are the measurements of the altar, using the same kind of measuring rod that was used for the temple area: There is a gutter around the altar that is \add both\add* half a metre deep and wide. There is a rim around it that is 23cm wide. That will be the base for \add the rest of\add* the altar.\x + \xo 43:13-17: \xt Exo 27:1-2; 2Ch 4:1.\x*
\v 14 The lower part of the gutter is one metre high to the lower ledge that surrounds the altar. The lower ledge is one-half metre wide. From that ledge to the upper ledge, it is two metres. That ledge is also one-half metre wide.
\v 15 The altar body \add at the top\add* is another two metres high and has a \add hornlike projection\add* jutting up \add from each of its corners\add*.
\v 16 The sides of the square body are six metres long.
\v 17 The upper ledge that borders the altar body is also a square, eight metres long on each side, and has a rim all around that is 27cm wide. There is a gutter measuring one-half metre at the bottom of the altar. There are steps leading up to the east side of the altar.”
\s1 The purification of the new altar
\p
\v 18 Then \add the man\add* told me, “Humanity’s child, the master Yahweh says that those are the dimensions for when they make the altar for presenting the burnt offering on, and for sprinkling blood onto.\x + \xo 43:18-27: \xt Exo 29:35-37.\x*
\v 19 You must give a bull from the cattle as a sin offering for the Levitical priests who are Tsadok’s descendants—those who approach me to serve me. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 20 Then you will take some of \add the bull’s\add* blood and place it on the altar’s ‘horns’ and on the four top edges and the surrounding rim. You will purify it and \add make it allowable in my presence\add*.
\v 21 Then take that sin-offering bull and burn it in the designated part of the temple area outside the sanctuary.
\v 22 Then on the second day, you’ll get a male goat without blemish from the goats and offer it as a sin offering—the priests will purified the altar just as they purified it with the bull.
\v 23 When you finish that purification, offer an unblemished bull from the cattle and an unblemished ram from the flock,
\v 24 and offer them to \add me,\add* Yahweh. The priests will throw salt onto them and present them as a burnt offering to Yahweh.
\v 25 Then every day for \add the next\add* seven days you must bring a billy goat to the priest to be sacrificed for an offering, so I will accept the altar. You must also sacrifice a young bull and a ram, each without any defect, that the priests will provide.
\v 26 They must atone for the altar for seven days and purify it, and in that way they must consecrate it \add to me\add*.
\v 27 \add After doing all that\add*, from the eighth day onward the priests will prepare your burnt offerings and your peace offerings on the altar, and I will accept you all. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.”
\c 44
\s1 The locked doorway
\p
\v 1 Then the man took me back to the outer sanctuary gate facing east, \add but\add* it was shut
\v 2 and Yahweh told me, “This gate has been sealed shut—it won’t be opened. No person will go through it, because Yisrael’s God Yahweh entered through it, so it’s \add now\add* closed.
\v 3 \add Only Yisrael’s\add* ruler will sit by it to eat food \add in front of\add* Yahweh, \add but\add* he’ll enter via the gate’s porch, and leave the same way.”
\s1 Foreigners disallowed in the temple
\p
\v 4 Then he took me to the front of the temple by way of the northern gate, and I looked, and wow, Yahweh’s brilliance filled \add his\add* temple, and I fell to \add my knees with\add* my face \add bowed towards the ground\add*.
\v 5 Then Yahweh told me, “Humanity’s child, \add pay attention\add* and look with your eyes and listen with your ears to everything that I’m declaring to you: all the instructions about Yahweh’s temple and all its regulations. \add Take special note of\add* the temple’s entrance and exits.
\v 6 Then tell the rebellious \add Israelis\add* that the master Yahweh says this: Let all of your disgusting actions be enough for all you Israeli people—
\v 7 that you brought foreigners with uncircumcised hearts and uncircumcised flesh to be in my sanctuary, profaning my temple, while you all were offering me food, fat and blood. You’ve all broken my agreement with all your disgusting actions.
\v 8 You haven’t carried out your duties regarding my sacred things, but \add on the contrary,\add* you all appointed others to take up your duties, and you assigned them to care for my sacred place.
\p
\v 9 “The master Yahweh says this: No foreigner from any of those who live among the people of Yisrael, may enter my sacred place if they’re not physically circumcised or if they \add haven’t declared themselves as my followers\add*.
\s1 Demotion of the Levites
\p
\v 10 The Levites went far from me—wandering away from me \add and\add* going after their idols, but they will be punished.
\v 11 They’re \add still\add* servants in my sanctuary, watching the temple gates and serving inside, and they slaughter the burnt offerings and the people’s sacrifices, and they’ll stand before the people and serve them.
\v 12 \add However,\add* because they sacrificed to their idols, they became sinful stumbling blocks for the \add Israeli people\add*, therefore I’ve \add promised to take action\add* against them and they’ll \add pay for their disobedience\add*. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 13 They mustn’t come near to me to act as my priests or to approach any of my sacred things, the most sacred things. Instead, they’ll bear their shame and their guilt for the disgusting things that they’ve done,
\v 14 but I’ll place them as keepers of the work in the temple—for all of its \add mundane\add* duties and \add all the menial work\add* that’s done in it.
\s1 The priests descendants of Saduk
\p
\v 15 Then the Levitical priests, those descendants of Tsadok who fulfilled the duties of my sanctuary when the Israeli people were wandering away from me, they will approach me to worship me. They will stand in front of me to offer me the fat and the blood. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\v 16 They will come to my sanctuary and approach my table to worship me and to fulfill their duties to me.
\v 17 When they come to the gates of the inner courtyard, they will have to dress in linen clothing, because they mustn’t \add wear\add* wool inside the courtyard gates or in the temple.\x + \xo 44:17-18: \xt Exo 28:39-43; Lev 16:4.\x*
\v 18 \add They must wear\add* linen turbans on their heads and linen underclothes around their waists. They mustn’t dress in clothing that makes them sweat.
\v 19 When they go \add back\add* out to the outer courtyard to go \add back again\add* to the people, they must take off the clothes they wore when they served—they must take them off and lay them down in a sacred room, so they don’t make other people sacred by contact with their special clothing.\x + \xo 44:19: \xt Lev 16:23.\x*
\p
\v 20 \add The priests\add* mustn’t shave their heads or allow their hair to hang loosely, but they must \add keep the hair on their heads neatly trimmed\add*.
\v 21 No priest should drink wine \add before\add* he comes to the inner court.\x + \xo 44:21: \xt Lev 10:9.\x*
\v 22 \add Also, priests can’t marry widows of men who were not priests, or women who have been divorced—they’re permitted to marry only Israeli women who’ve never been married, or widows of other priests\add*.
\p
\v 23 They must teach the people the difference between things that are sacred and things that are not, and teach them how to know what things are acceptable to me and what things are not.\x + \xo 44:23: \xt Lev 10:10.\x*
\v 24 In a dispute they must judge in accordance with my instructions and regulations. They must keep my law and my statutes at every religious celebration, and they must observe my sacred rest days.
\p
\v 25 \add Priests\add* mustn’t defile themselves by going near person’s dead body. However, if the dead person was his father or mother, son or daughter, brother or unmarried sister, then they can defile themselves,
\v 26 and after they’ve been purified, they must \add wait\add* for seven days.
\v 27 Then \add after that\add*, \add when\add* he goes into the inner courtyard to serve in the sacred place, he must bring a sin offering for himself. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p
\v 28 \add The priests must not own any land\add*—I am their inheritance and I will be their property.\x + \xo 44:28: \xt Num 18:20.\x*
\v 29 They will have the food offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings, to eat, plus everything in Yisrael that’s devoted to Yahweh will be theirs.\x + \xo 44:29-30: \xt Num 18:8-19.\x*
\v 30 The best of the firstfruits \add from every harvest\add* and every contribution \add from the people\add*, will belong to the priests, and you all will give the first of your \add bread\add* dough\f + \fr 44:30 \ft Probably after it’s cooked???\f* to the priests so that blessing may rest on your home.
\v 31 Priests must not eat \add the meat of any bird or animal that is found dead or that has been killed by any other\add* animal.\x + \xo 44:31: \xt Lev 22:8.\x*
\c 45
\s1 Yahweh’s section of land
\p
\v 1 When you cast lots to divide up the land as an inheritance \add for the tribes\add*, you must make an offering of land to Yahweh. That offering will become a sacred part of the land: \add thirteen kilometres by ten kilometres in size\add*.\f + \fr 45:1 \ft The ‘ten kilometres’ (twenty thousand cubits) from the Septuagint appears to correct the Hebrew which has half of that, but then v3 and v4 wouldn’t make sense.\f* \add That entire area\add* will become sacred.
\v 2 \add Within that area,\add* a 270m wide square area that will surround the sacred place \add will be left empty\add*, with a further border around twenty-seven metres wide.
\v 3 Inside that \add first, larger\add* area, measure a \add rectangle\add* thirteen kilometres by five kilometres for the sanctuary—the most sacred place.
\v 4 It will be a sacred place in the nation for the priests who serve Yahweh, who come near Yahweh to serve him. It will be a place for their houses and a sacred area for the sacred place.
\v 5 The \add other half\add* which is \add also\add* thirteen kilometres long and five kilometres wide will be for towns for the Levites who serve in the temple.
\p
\v 6 You’ll designate an area thirteen kilometres long by half a kilometre wide for the city that will be next to the area reserved for the holy place. This city will belong to all the \add Israeli people\add*.
\s1 The leader’s section of land
\p
\v 7 The leader’s land will be on both sides of the area reserved for the holy place and the city—on the west and the east. Its length will \add be the same as those portions that it’s parallel to\add*.
\v 8 That area will belong to Yisrael’s leader \add so\add* the leaders won’t keep oppressing my people, \add but rather\add* they’ll give the rest of the land to \add be divided among the tribes\add*.
\v 9 The master Yahweh says this: \add That’s plenty\add* for you, leaders of Israel! \add Replace your\add* violence and strife \add with\add* justice and righteousness. Quit your evictions of my people. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\s1 Dealing with produce and animals
\p
\v 10 You all must \add use accurate scales and containers\add*.\x + \xo 45:10: \xt Lev 19:36.\x*
\v 11 \add The baskets for measuring dry things and containers for measuring liquids (called an ‘efah’ for dry things and a ‘bath’ for liquids, both a tenth of the large 220 litre ‘homer’) must be the same volume—each must hold twenty-two litres\add*.
\v 12 \add For weights, the shekel weight must be ten grams. (Twenty ‘gerahs’ makes one shekel, then sixty shekels makes one ‘mina’.)\add*
\p
\v 13 You all must present \add to the ruler\add* \add one measure of wheat or barley for every sixty measures\add* \add that you harvest\add*,
\v 14 \add one measure of olive oil for every one hundred measures\add* \add that you all produce\add*,
\v 15 plus one sheep or goat from the flock for every two hundred animals from the watered regions of Yisrael to be used for any burnt offering or peace offering to make atonement for the people. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\p
\v 16 All the people in the country will give that contribution to Yisrael’s leader.
\v 17 It will be the leader’s responsibility to supply the animals for the burnt offerings, the grain offerings, and the drink offerings at the festivals and the new moon celebrations, and on the rest days—all the fixed festivals of the \add Israeli people\add*. He will provide for the sin offerings, the grain offerings, the burnt offerings, and the peace offerings \add to make the Israeli people right\add* \add with God\add*.
\s1 The festivals
\r (Exo. 12:1-20; Lev. 23:33-43)
\p
\v 18 The master Yahweh says this: On the first \add day\add* of the first month \add of the year\add*, you must take an unblemished bull from the herd and perform a sin offering \add to purify\add* the temple.
\v 19 The priest will take some of the blood of that sin offering and place it on the doorposts of the temple and on the four corners of the border of the altar, and on the doorposts of the gate to the inner court.
\v 20 You will do this \add again\add* on the seventh \add day\add* of that month for each person’s accidental sin, or sin by ignorance. \add In that way you’ll\add* \add make the temple pure\add* \add in God’s sight\add*.
\p
\v 21 Then on the fourteenth day of that first month, you all will have a seven-day celebration, \add when you’ll eat bread made without any rising agent\add*.\x + \xo 45:21: \xt Exo 12:1-20; Num 28:16-25.\x*
\v 22 That same day, the leader will prepare a bull as a sin offering for himself and for all the people in the country.
\v 23 For the seven days of the celebration, the leader will prepare a burnt offering for Yahweh: Seven bulls and seven unblemished rams each day for seven days, and a male goat each day as a sin offering.
\v 24 Then the leader will perform a food offering of twenty-two litres \add of flour\add* with seven litres of \add olive\add* oil for each bull and each ram.
\p
\v 25 On the fifteenth day of the seventh month \add of the year\add*, at the \add ‘temporary shelters’\add* celebration, the leader will perform offerings on those seven days: Sin offerings, burnt offerings, food offerings, and offerings of oil.\x + \xo 45:25: \xt Lev 23:33-36; Num 29:12-38.\x*
\c 46
\s1 The leader and the festivals
\p
\v 1 The master Yahweh says this: The eastern gate of the inner courtyard will be shut for the six days of work, but it will be opened on rest days and on the day of the new moon.
\v 2 The leader will enter the outer courtyard by the way of that gate and its outside porch, and he’ll stand at the doorposts of the inner gate while the priests perform his burnt offering and peace offering. Then he’ll worship \add right there\add* at the inner gate and \add then leave again\add*, but the gate won’t be shut until evening.
\v 3 The people will also worship in front of Yahweh at the entrance to that gate on rest days and new moons.
\v 4 The burnt offering that the leader offers to Yahweh on the rest day will be six unblemished lambs and an unblemished ram.
\v 5 The grain offering that he gives with the ram is twenty-two litres \add of flour\add*, and with the lambs it should be as much as he pleases, along with one litre of \add olive\add* oil for every twenty-two litres of flour.
\v 6 On the day of the new moon he must offer a bull, six lambs, and a ram—\add all without any defects\add*.
\v 7 He must \add also\add* provide a grain offering of twenty-two litres of flour with the bull, the same with the ram, and as much as he wants with the lambs, along with a litre of \add olive\add* oil with every twenty-two litres of flour.
\v 8 The leader enters by the way of the gate and its porch, and he must leave by the same way.
\p
\v 9 But when the people of the land come before Yahweh at the appointed festivals, anyone entering through the north gate to worship must leave through the south gate, and anyone entering through the south gate must leave through the north gate. No one is allowed to turn back to the gate through which they entered, because everyone must keep going straight ahead until they get out.
\v 10 The leader must be amongst them in their midst—when they go in, he must go in, and when they leave, he must leave.
\v 11 During the festivals \add that you hold for me\add*, the king must present twenty-two litres of flour along with a bull or a ram, and as much flour as he wants to with the lambs, along with a litre of \add olive\add* oil with every twenty-two litres of flour.
\p
\v 12 When the leader gives a freewill offering to Yahweh (either a burnt offering or a peace offering), the eastern gate will be opened for him. He will offer his burnt offering or his peace offering just like he does on the rest day. Then he must go out, and after he’s gone out the gate will be shut.
\s1 The daily sacrifice
\p
\v 13 In addition, \add every morning someone\f + \fr 46:13 \ft Some of the earliest translations (the Septuagint and the Vulgate) have ‘he’ here, suggesting it must be the leader.\f* must provide\add* a one year old lamb with no defects to be \add completely burnt up as an\add* offering to Yahweh.
\v 14 \add Also\add* \add every morning\add* someone must provide an offering of four litres of flour mixed with a litre of \add olive\add* oil, \add and\add* \add it’s a permanent requirement\add*.
\v 15 They’ll prepare the lamb, the grain offering, and the oil, \add every morning\add*—a permanent \add daily\add* burnt offering.
\s1 The leader and the country
\p
\v 16 The master Yahweh says this: If the leader gives a gift to any of his sons, it becomes his inheritance, i.e., it will become the property of his sons \add because\add* it’s an inheritance.
\v 17 \add But\add* if he gives a gift from his inheritance to one of his servants, then it will belong to that servant until the year of liberty, and then it will return to the leader. His inheritance must definitely be for his \add own\add* sons.\x + \xo 46:17: \xt Lev 25:10.\x*
\v 18 The leader mustn’t take the people’s inheritance away from their own property—he must provide for his sons from his own property so that my people will not be \add forced off their own inherited land\add*.”
\s1 The temple kitchens
\p
\v 19 Next the man brought me through the entrance at the gate to the sacred rooms for the priests which were north-facing, and what’s more, there was a place toward the west.
\v 20 He told me, “That’s the place where the priests must boil the guilt offering and the sin offering and where they must bake the grain offering. They mustn’t bring the offerings into the outer courtyard, because then the people would become sacred \add (and not be able to leave)\add*.”
\p
\v 21 Then he brought me to the outer courtyard and he led me past the four corners of that courtyard, and I saw that in every corner of the courtyard there was \add another\add* \add enclosed area\add*
\v 22 that were each twenty-two metres long and sixteen metres wide.
\v 23 Around the inside of each of those enclosed areas was a stone ledge, cooking hearths \add all around\add* under the ledge.
\v 24 The man told me, “Those are the places where the temple workers will boil the people’s sacrifices.”
\c 47
\s1 The healing river
\p
\v 1 Then the man took me back to the temple entrance, and there was water flowing out from under the \add front edge of the building\add* toward the east, and the water was flowing down the south side of the temple, to the right of the altar.\x + \xo 47:1: \xt Zech 14:8; Yhn 7:38; Rev 22:1.\x*
\v 2 So he took me out through the northern gate and led me around \add the outside\add* to the eastern gate, and look, the water was flowing from this gate on its south side.
\v 3 As the man \add started walking\add* toward the east holding his measuring line in his hand, he measured off five hundred metres and led me through the water which was ankle-deep.
\v 4 Then he measured another five hundred metres and led me through the water which was \add now\add* knee-deep, and then after another five hundred metres it was then \add up to the waist\add*.
\v 5 Finally he measured off another five hundred metres, but the water had become deep enough to swim in and too deep to cross—it was a \add now\add* river that could not be walked across.
\v 6 The man \add asked\add* me, “Humanity’s child, \add have you taken note of all\add* this?”
\p Then he led me out and had me \add return\add* along the riverbank.
\v 7 As I walked back, wow, \add now\add* the riverbank had many trees on each side.
\v 8 The man told me, “This water \add flows eastward and down into the Rift Valley\add*. \add It’ll\add* flow into the Dead Sea and will make it into fresh water.
\v 9 \add That will lead to\add* every kind of living creature that swarms living where that water flows. There’ll be lots of fish when that water flows \add into the Dead Sea\add* as it causes the salty water to become fresh water—everything will live wherever that river goes.
\v 10 Then the fishermen from Eyn-Gedi will stand \add there\add* by the water, and there will be a place to dry out the fishing nets near Eyn-Eglaim. There will be many kinds of fish in the Dead Sea—plentiful just like the fish in the Mediterranean Sea.
\v 11 \add However,\add* the Dead Sea’s swamps and marshes won’t be made fresh—they’ll be for providing salt.
\v 12 Beside that river on both banks, all kinds of fruit trees will grow. Their leaves will never wilt, and \add they’ll never fail to fruit\add*—\add in fact\add* \add they’ll\add* bear fruit every month because that water from the temple flows to them. Their fruit will be \add good to eat\add*, and their leaves will \add help with\add* healing.\x + \xo 47:12: \xt Rev 22:2.\x*
\s1 Land boundaries
\p
\v 13 The master Yahweh says that this will be the way that you divide the land up for Yisrael’s twelve tribes: Yosef \add (Joseph)\add* will have \add a double allocation\add*.
\v 14 You are to equally divide \add the land\add* that I \add took action\add* to give to your ancestors—\add from now on\add* that land will come to you all as an inheritance.
\p
\v 15 \add These will be the land boundaries\add*: On the north side, it will extend from the Mediterranean Sea east along the road towards Hetlon, and then on to Tsedad,
\v 16 to Berotah, and then on to Sivrayim, which is on the border between Damascus and Hamat. The boundary will run as far as Hatser-Hattikon, which is on the border of the Havran \add region\add*.
\v 17 \add So\add* the boundary will extend from the Mediterranean Sea to Hatsar-Enan on the border between Hamat to the north and Damascus \add to the south\add*. \add That will be the northern boundary\add*.
\p
\v 18 On the eastern side, the boundary will extend between Havran and Damascus, south along the Yordan \add River\add* between the Gilead \add region\add* and the territory of Israel, along the Dead Sea as far as Tamar.\f + \fr 47:18 \ft Tamar: the Hebrew has ‘the Eastern Sea’.\f* \add That will be the eastern boundary\add*.
\p
\v 19 On the southern side, the boundary will extend from Tamar to the springs near Merivat-Kadesh. Then it will extend \add west\add* along the brook of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea. \add That will be the southern boundary\add*.
\p
\v 20 On the western side, the boundary will be the Mediterranean Sea, \add north\add* to a point near Levo-Hamat.
\p
\v 21 This is how you’ll all divide this land for yourselves among Yisrael’s tribes:
\v 22 You all must assign the land as a permanent possession for yourselves and also for any foreigners who are living and raising their children among you. You all must consider them to be like native born Israelis, and they must be assigned land among Yisrael’s tribes.
\v 23 Wherever foreigners are living, you must give them some land \add to belong to them permanently\add*. That is what the master Yahweh declares.”
\c 48
\s1 Land allocated to Yisrael’s tribes
\p
\v 1 Here is a list of the tribes of Yisrael and the territory that each tribe is to receive. The northern boundary of Yisrael will start at the Mediterranean Sea and go \add east\add* to Hetlon \add city\add*, then to Levo-Hamat, and farther on to Hatsar-Enan, which is \add south\add* of Damascus, and it will continue to Hamat. Each tribe will receive land that will extend from the eastern boundary of Yisrael west to the Mediterranean Sea.
\p The tribe of Dan will receive land alongside Yisrael’s northern border.
\v 2 \add South of their area\add* will be the territory for the tribe of Asher.
\v 3 \add South of\add* Asher’s land will be territory for the tribe of Naftali.
\v 4 \add South of\add* Naftali’s land will be territory for the tribe of Menashsheh.
\v 5 \add South of\add* Menashsheh’s land will be territory for the tribe of Efraim.
\v 6 \add South of\add* Efraim’s land will be territory for the tribe of Reuven.
\v 7 \add South of\add* Reuven’s land will be territory for the tribe of Yehudah \add (Judah)\add*.
\s1 The chosen place
\p
\v 8 \add South of\add* Yehudah’s land will be an area that the entire nation will give to me—you all will set it apart for special use. The temple will be in the centre of this area which will be thirteen kilometres long (same as the other land allocations).
\p
\v 9 This special area will be thirteen kilometres long and five kilometres wide. That’s what you’ll all give to Yahweh.
\v 10 Within that special area, this is what will be allocated to the priests: you will assign them an area of land measuring thirteen kilometres on the northern and southern side, and five kilometres on the western and eastern sides. Yahweh’s temple will be in the middle of that special area.
\v 11 The temple area will be for the priests, Tsadok’s descendants, who are dedicated to serving me. (They’re the ones who served me faithfully and didn’t turn away \add from me\add* like the Levites \add and the others\add* did.)
\v 12 The \add priests’ allocation\add* will be a portion of that very sacred land, extending to the Levites’ border.
\v 13 The land assigned to the Levites will be the same size as the land that the priests will receive. (So together, these two portions of land will be thirteen kilometres long and about ten kilometres wide.)
\v 14 They mustn’t sell or barter it—none of this firstfruits of the land of Yisrael must ever be \add used for any different purpose\add* because it’s all sacred to Yahweh.
\p
\v 15 Another strip of land thirteen kilometres long and almost three kilometres wide will be allotted for other people living in the special area to use. They may build homes and have pasturelands there, and there’ll be a city in the middle of that area.
\v 16 The city \add will be square, over two kilometres long on each side\add*
\v 17 with an open area around it, within the special area, that will be about 130m wide in each direction.
\v 18 Outside the city there will be two strips that will extend five kilometres on each of the east and west sides, and the produce from \add those strips\add* will be food for those working in the city.
\v 19 \add Those who come from the various tribes to work in the city may also work in this farmland\add*.
\v 20 That entire special area, including the land given for Yahweh’s use and the city, will be a square that is thirteen kilometres long on each side.
\p
\v 21 The tracts of land to the east and to the west of Yahweh’s area and the city will belong to the leader. One area will extend thirteen kilometres east to Yisrael’s eastern boundary, and the other will extend thirteen kilometres west \add to the Mediterranean Sea\add*. Yahweh’s area, which contains the temple, will be in the middle.
\v 22 The area that belongs to the leader (that surrounds the property of the Levites and the city in the middle of it) will be between the tribe of Yehudah \add to the north\add* and the tribe of Benyamin \add to the south\add*.
\p
\v 23 South of Yahweh’s area, each of the other tribes will receive one section of land that extends from the eastern \add boundary of Yisrael\add* west \add all the way to the Mediterranean Sea.\add*
\p Just south of Yahweh’s area will be territory for the tribe of Benyamin.
\v 24 \add South of\add* Benyamin’s land will be the land for the tribe of Shimeon.
\v 25 \add South of\add* Shimeon’s land will be the land for the tribe of Yissaskar.
\v 26 \add South of\add* Yissaskar’s land will be the land for the tribe of Zevulun.
\v 27 \add South of\add* Zevulun’s land will be the land for the tribe of Gad.
\v 28 Gad’s southern boundary will extend from Tamar \add south\add* to the waters of Merivah-Kadesh, and farther \add west\add* to the brook \add of Egypt\add*, and then on to the Mediterranean Sea.
\p
\v 29 That \add describes\add* the territory for which you allocate to Yisrael’s tribes to become their permanent inheritance. That is the master Yahweh’s declaration.
\s1 The city gateways
\p
\v 30 These will be the exits from the city: On the northern side (which will be just over two kilometres long),\x + \xo 48:30-34: \xt Rev 21:12-13.\x*
\v 31 there’ll be three gates named after the tribes of Reuven, Yehudah, and Levi.
\v 32 On the eastern side (the same length) there’ll be three gates named after the tribes of Yosef, Benyamin, and Dan.
\v 33 On the southern side (the same length) there’ll be three gates named after the tribes of Shimeon, Yissaskar, and Zevulun.
\v 34 On the western side (the same length) there’ll be three gates named after the tribes of Gad, Asher, and Naftali.
\v 35 The \add distance around the city\add* will be nine kilometres.
\p From that time onwards, the city’s name will be ‘Yahweh is there’ \add (Yahweh-Shammah)\add*.
