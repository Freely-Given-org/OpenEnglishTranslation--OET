\is1 Introduction
\ip This short document was written by the prophet Ovadyah (three syllables, traditionally spelt as ‘Obadiah’) and is about God’s judgement and punishment of Edom—the nation made up of Esau’s descendants. Esau was Yacob’s twin-brother—the sons of Yitshak (‘Isaac’), however the two sets of descendants ended up as enemies. So that’s why Edom’s people were very glad when the Babylonian army destroyed Yerushalem in 586 before Yeshua/Jesus (B.C.), and not just that, they took advantage of the invasion to join in looting the city and help the invaders. Here, God passes on through Ovadyah the declaration that Edom will be punished and defeated and their warriors would be slaughtered without any survivors, thus allowing Israel to recapture their lands.

\v 1 \add This is\add* the vision of Obadiah \add given\add* by the master Yahweh concerning \add the Edom region\add*:
\s1 Coming punishment for Edom
\q1 We have heard from Yahweh and a messenger has been sent to the nations, \add telling them:\add*
\q1 \add Get everything ready\add* then go into battle against \add Edom\add*.
\m
\v 2 \add And Yahweh says to Edom:\add*
\q1 Listen,
\q1 I will make you into an insignificant nation.
\q1 You’ll become utterly despised.
\q1
\v 3 Your \add inner\add* pride has deceived you,
\q2 you who live on the rocky cliffs,
\q2 with your homes up there so high.
\q1 You say \add to yourselves\add* \add that\add*
\q2 no one can bring you down to the ground.
\q1
\v 4 If you go up high like an eagle,
\q1 even if your nest was up between the stars,
\q1 Yahweh declares that his \add command\add* can bring you down from there.
\b
\q1
\v 5 If \add it was\add* thieves who came to destroy you in the night,
\q2 (and yes, you’re going to be destroyed)
\q1 they would only steal what they wanted.
\q1 Or if \add it was\add* grape-pickers who came to you,
\q1 \add at least\add* they’d leave behind \add the smaller grapes\add*.
\q1
\v 6 How Esau’s \add descendants\add* will be looted.

\s1 The charges against Edom

\q1
\v 11 You \add just\add* \add stood and watched\add* on that day when strangers \add carried away their\add* wealth.
\q1 When foreigners entered their gates and \add took possession\add* of Yerushalem, you \add wished it was you doing that\add*.
\q1
\v 12 You \add shouldn’t have gloated\add* over your \add cousins\add* on the day of \add their\add* misfortune.

\v 14 You \add shouldn’t have\add* stood at the crossroads to \add kill those trying to escape\add*,\x + \xo 1:1-14: \xt Isa 34:5-17; 63:1-6; Jer 49:7-22; Eze 25:12-14; 35:1-15; Amos 1:11-12; Mal 1:2-5.\x*
\q1 And you \add shouldn’t have handed-over\add* any survivors that you’d captured in \add their\add* \add time\add* of trouble.
\s1 The punishment of nations
\q1
\v 15 For all the nations, Yahweh’s day is near,
\q1 Just as you’ve done, \add the same\add* will be done to you.
\q1 Your actions will return onto your own head.
\q1
\v 16 Because just like how all you \add Israelis\add*\f + \fr 1:16 \ft It’s not actually clear from the Hebrew who ‘you all’ refers to, so the addition of ‘Israelis’ is clearly an interpretive decision and other translations might differ.\f* drank \add suffering\add* on my holy mountain,

\q1
\v 21 The rescuers will go up Mt. Tsiyyon/Zion to judge Esau’s mountain.
