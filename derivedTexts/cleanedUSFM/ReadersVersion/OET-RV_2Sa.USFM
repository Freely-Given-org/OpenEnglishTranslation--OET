\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk Second Shemuel\bk* (commonly, but wrongly known as ‘Samuel’) is the continuation of \bk First Shemuel\bk*—the two parts together are considered a single ‘book’ in the Jewish Bible—it’s only split into two because it was too long to fit on a single scroll.
\ip This the story of David’s reign: firstly he ruled what became known as ‘Yehudah’ (Judah) in the south east (chapters 1–4), and eventually, the entire nation, including the much larger area of Yisrael (called ‘Israel’ in older translations) in the north east (Chapter 5–24). This document explains how David dealt with his enemies within the country, as well as battling with other nations in order to widen and strengthen his kingdom. David’s faith and respect of God is demonstrated here, as well as his love for the people. However, despite that, he was also fierce and he was quite capable of disobeying God to get what he wanted. But God sees everything and seen his prophet Natan (Nathan) with a parable to show David his selfishness. David asked for forgiven for his sin and accepted the punishment that God gave him.
\ip The times of peace and prosperity through the latter parts of David’s rule were planted in the minds of the Hebrew people, and in the future when they faced difficulties, they would long for another king like David—a son (better ‘a descendant’) of David who would love God like him.

\s1 David learns about Sha’ul’s death
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add After\add* David returned from \add slaughtering\add* the Amalekites, he stayed in Tsiklag for two days. (\add King\add* Sha’ul \add was dead by this time\add*.)
\v 2 Then on the third day, wow, a man came from Sha’ul’s camp. He had torn clothes and dirt on his head, and when he got to David he \add fell onto his knees and bowed low\add*.
\v 3 “Where \add have you come from\add*?” David \add asked\add* him.
\p “I \add was in Yisrael’s camp, but managed to escape\add*.” he \add replied\add*.
\v 4 “\add Why? What happened?\add*” David \add demanded\add*. “Tell me, please,”
\p “\add Our\add* people fled from the battle,” the man said. “Many fell and died. Even Sha’ul and his son Yonatan died.”
\p
\v 5 “How do you know that Sha’ul and Yonatan died?” David \add asked\add* the young man who’d \add brought the news\add*.
\p
\v 6 “I happened to be on Mt. Gilboa,” the young man \add replied\add*, “and listen, Sha’ul was leaning on his spear. Then wow, the chariots and the masters of the chariot horses overtook him,\x + \xo 1:6-10: \xt 1Sam 31:1-6; 1Ch 10:1-6.\x*
\v 7 and he turned around and saw me. He called me and I \add answered\add*, ‘Here I am.’
\v 8 ‘Who are you?’ he \add asked\add*. ‘I’m an Amalekite,’ I told him.
\v 9 Then he said to me, ‘Please, \add come over here\add* and kill me, because \add although I’m still alive, the pain is unbearable\add*.’
\v 10 \add So\add* I stood over him and killed him, because I knew that \add with those wounds\add*, he wouldn’t live. Then I took the crown off his head and the bracelet on his arm, and I brought them here to you, my master.”
\p
\v 11 Then David pulled at his clothes \add with his hands\add* and tore them, and all the men with him \add did the same\add*,
\v 12 and they mourned and wept and fasted until the evening for Sha’ul and for his son Yonatan, and for Yahweh’s people, because \add many\add* \add Israelis had been killed\add*.
\p
\v 13 Then David \add asked\add* the young man \add who’d brought the news\add*, “Where are you from?”
\p “I’m a foreigner’s son,” he \add replied\add*, “an Amalekite.”
\v 14 “How come you weren’t afraid to \add kill\add* Yahweh’s anointed \add king\add* \add with your own hands\add*?” David \add asked\add* him.
\v 15 Then David called to one of \add his\add* young men, “Come \add over here\add* \add and\add* \add execute\add* him.” \add So\add* he struck him, and he died.
\v 16 “Your blood’s on your \add own\add* head,” David told \add the Amalekite\add*, “because \add you admitted in your own words\add* that you, yourself killed Yahweh’s anointed \add one\add*.”
\s1 David’s song of mourning
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 17 Then David sang this funeral song for Sha’ul and his son Yonatan
\v 18 and said \add that it should be\add* taught to the \add people\add* of Yehudah. \add It’s called\add* ‘The bow’ and indeed, it’s written \add down\add* in the Book of Yashar:\x + \xo 1:18: \xt Josh 10:13.\x*
\q1
\v 19 “Yisrael’s splendour \add was\add* slain \add in the hills\add*.
\q1 How the \add powerful\add* \add warriors\add* have \add died\add*.
\q1
\v 20 Don’t tell \add them\add* in Gat.
\q1 Don’t let \add them\add* take the news to Ashkelon’s streets,
\q1 in case the Philistine \add women\add* celebrate,
\q1 and the daughters of the uncircumcised are elated.
\b
\q1
\v 21 \add You\add* mountains in Gilboa,
\q2 \add may you have\add* no dew or rain \add fall\add* on you,
\q2 nor fields \add producing grain\add* for offerings.
\q1 Because it was there that \add Shaul’s\add* shield was \add splattered with his blood\add*,
\q2 and \add the leather\add* won’t be \add preserved\add* with oil \add again\add*.
\q1
\v 22 From the blood of those slain—
\q2 from the fat of the \add warriors\add*,
\q1 Yonatan’s bow didn’t \add retreat\add*
\q2 and Sha’ul’s sword didn’t \add fail on its strikes\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 23 Sha’ul and Yonatan were loved—
\q2 they pleased the people.
\q2 and even at their death they weren’t separated.
\q1 They were swifter than eagles.
\q2 they were stronger than lions.
\b
\q1
\v 24 Weep for Sha’ul you daughters of Yisrael,
\q1 the one who \add dressed you in nice clothes with jewellery\add*,
\q1 and gave you all gold \add brooches\add* to put on.
\b
\q1
\v 25 Those warriors have fallen in the middle of the battle.
\q1 Yonatan has been killed \add there\add* on the hills.
\b
\q1
\v 26 I \add grieve\add* for you my dear friend Yonatan.
\q1 You were \add so kind\add* to me.
\q1 Your \add friendship meant more to me\add* than the women \add who say they love me\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 27 \add Yes, those\add* \add powerful warriors\add* have fallen,
\q1 and those weapons of war have \add been destroyed\add*.”

\s1 The kingdom of David
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 After \add that was over\add*, David inquired from Yahweh, “Should I go into one of Yehudah’s cities?”
\p “\add Yes,\add*, go,” Yahweh \add answered\add*.
\p “Where should I go?” David \add asked\add* \add again\add*.
\p “To Hebron,” he said.
\p
\v 2 \add So\add* David took his two wives (Ahinoam the Yezreelite and Abigail the \add widow\add* of Nabal the Carmelite) and went there.\x + \xo 2:2: \xt 1Sam 25:42-43.\x*
\v 3 He took his men who were with him, along with their \add families\add*, and went to live in Hebron and the \add surrounding\add* towns.
\v 4 Then the Yehudah \add leaders\add* came and anointed David as king over Yehudah.
\p They told him, “It was the men of Yabesh-Gilead who buried Sha’ul.”\x + \xo 2:4: \xt 1Sam 31:11-13.\x*
\v 5 \add So\add* David sent messengers to Yabesh-Gilead to tell them, “May Yahweh bless you all because you \add showed\add* that kindness to your master Sha’ul to bury him \add respectfully\add*.
\v 6 Now may Yahweh \add treat\add* you all with kindness and faithfulness, and I myself will also be good to you because you did that.
\v 7 \add Meanwhile\add* now that Sha’ul your master is dead, \add continue\add* to be courageous and become \add brave warriors\add* as Yehudah has anointed me as king over \add their tribe\add*.
\s1 Disputes between Sha’ul and David’s families
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 8 \add However,\add* Abner (Ner’s son) who’d been Sha’ul’s army commander had taken Sha’ul’s son Iysh-Boshet\f + \fr 2:8 \ft Also known as Esh-Baal. (See 1 Chronicles 8:33.)\f* across to Mahanayim
\v 9 and \add declared\add* him to be king over Gilead, and over the Asherites and Yezreel, and over Efraim and Benyamin, and over all of Yisrael.
\v 10 Iysh-Boshet \add was forty years old\add* when he \add started to rule\add* over the \add Israelis\add*, and he \add ruled them\add* for two years.
\p But the tribe of Yehudah was loyal to David
\v 11 and \add he\add* \add ruled them\add* for seven and a half years.
\p
\v 12 \add One day\add* Abner left Mahanayim with \add some of\add* Iysh-Boshet’s servants and went to Gibeon,
\v 13 \add but\add* Yoav (Tseruyah’s son, \add traditionally called ‘Joab’ in English\add*) \add took some of\add* David’s servants and went and \add confronted\add* them at the Gibeon pool—one group on each side of the pool.
\v 14 Then Abner said to Yoav, “\add Let’s get some of these young warriors to fight it out in front of us\add*.”
\p “\add Sounds good to me\add*,” said Yoav.
\p
\v 15 \add So they stood up and counted off\add* twelve \add representing\add* Benyamin and Sha’ul’s son Iysh-Boshet and twelve from David’s servants.
\v 16 Each of them grabbed his opponent’s head and then thrust his sword into his side, so they both fell \add down\add* dead together. \add So\add* that place in Gibeon was \add named\add* ‘Helkat-Hatsurim’ \add (meaning ‘Field of Daggers’)\add*.
\p
\v 17 \add That led on to\add* a very intense battle that day, \add but\add* Abner and the Israeli men were \add defeated\add* by David’s servants.
\v 18 Tseruyah’s three sons were there: Yoav, Avishay, and Asah-El, (Asah-El was a \add fast runner\add*—like a wild antelope.)
\v 19 and Asah-El chased after Abner and \add wouldn’t give up\add*.
\v 20 Abner turned and said, “Is that you, Asah-El?”
\p “\add Yes,\add* it’s me,” he \add answered\add*.
\p
\v 21 “\add I’m warning you:\add* \add Stop chasing me and go after someone else instead\add*,” Abner \add called back\add*. But Asah-El \add wouldn’t give up\add*
\v 22 \add so\add* Abner \add tried again\add*, “\add Stop chasing me! You’ll force me to kill you\add*, then how could I face your brother Yoav?”
\v 23 \add But\add* \add Asah-El\add* \add wouldn’t give up so\add* Abner thrust the butt end of his spear into his stomach and it went right through and came out his back. He fell to the ground and died there, and \add when the others caught up, they stopped\add* there.
\p
\v 24 \add But\add* Yoav and Abishai \add kept going\add* after Abner. As the sun was setting, they came to the Ammah hill (east of Giah, along the road to the wilderness near Gibeon)
\v 25 and the \add Benyamites lined up\add* behind Abner as an \add coordinated unit\add* there on top of \add the\add* hill.
\v 26 Abner called out to Yoav, “\add Are we just going to keep killing each other\add*? Don’t you know that \add the only result can be more\add* bitterness? How long will you \add go on before you command your people to stop killing\add* their \add cousins\add*?”
\p
\v 27 “\add As God lives\add*,” Yoav \add replied\add*, “if you hadn’t \add said that\add*, then surely \add it would have been morning before they would have pulled back from the chase\add*.”
\v 28 \add So\add* Yoav had a trumpet blown and \add his\add* men \add stopped fighting and pursing the Israelis\add*.
\p
\v 29 Then Abner and his men walked all that night through the \add Jordan river plain\add*, then crossed the \add river\add* and walked all morning until they got \add back\add* to Mahanayim.
\p
\v 30 \add When\add* Yoav had assembled them all \add and counted them, only\add* Asah-El and nineteen others had been killed in the battle,
\v 31 \add although\add* \add they\add* had killed 360 of Abner’s Benyamite \add warriors\add*.
\v 32 They \add retrieved Asah-El’s body\add* and buried it in his father’s tomb in Beyt-Lehem. Then \add they\add* walked all night and got \add back\add* to Hebron \add at first\add* light.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 \add Nevertheless\add* the war between Sha’ul’s and David’s \add followers\add* dragged on and on, \add but\add* \add overall,\add* David’s \add side had more wins than the followers of Iysh-Boshet\add*.
\s1 David’s sons
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 2 David’s \add wives gave birth to\add* \add six\add* sons \add while they were based there\add* in Hebron: Ahinoam (the Yezreelite) gave birth to Amnon,
\v 3 then Abigail (the \add widow\add* of Nabal the Carmelite) \add gave birth to\add* Kileab, and Maakah (daughter of King Talmai of Geshur) \add gave birth to\add* Abshalom.
\v 4 The fourth was Adoniyyah (son of Haggit), the fifth was Shefatyah (son of Abital),
\v 5 and the sixth was Yitre’am (son of David’s wife Eglah). \add All six of\add* those \add sons\add* were born to David in Hebron.
\s1 Abner switches over to David
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 6 \add While the war between Sha’ul’s son Iysh-Boshet and David’s supporters continued\add*, Abner was strengthening himself with Sha’ul’s \add supporters\add*.
\v 7 \add Now\add* Sha’ul had had a slave-wife named Ritspah (daughter of Ayyah) and Abner slept with her. \add So\add* \add Iysh-Boshet\add* \add demanded\add*, “Why have you slept with my father’s slave-wife?”
\v 8 Abner \add became very angry at this challenge from Iysh-Boshet and snapped back\add*, “\add Do you think I’m Yehudah’s dog\add* \add hiding out over here\add*? Today I’ve been \add helping\add* Sha’ul’s \add family\add*: your father, his brothers, and his friends, and I won’t let you fall into David’s \add hands\add*. \add Yet\add* today you \add bring some charge against me to do with a\add* woman?
\v 9 May God punish \add me\add* if I don’t do for David exactly what Yahweh promised him
\v 10 \add and help with\add* the transfer of the kingdom away from \add your\add* family and to establish David’s \add kingdom\add* over \add both\add* Yehudah and Yisrael, from Dan \add down\add* to Beer-Sheba.”\x + \xo 3:10: \xt 1Sam 15:28.\x*
\v 11 Iysh-Boshet didn’t say a word back to Abner because he was very scared of him.
\p
\v 12 Then Abner sent messengers to David to tell \add him\add*, “Who should be king of this \add country\add*? \add Let’s come to an agreement and then I could join you\add* \add and help\add* make all of Yisrael turn to you.”
\p
\v 13 “\add Yes,\add* good,” \add David\add* \add replied\add*. “\add I’m happy to come to an agreement with you on one condition: you must bring my wife—Sha’ul’s daughter, Mikal—if you want to be accepted here\add*.”
\v 14 Then David sent messengers to Sha’ul’s son Iysh-Boshet saying, “Give \add Mikal back to\add* me. \add I earnt her as my wife with\add* the foreskins of one-hundred Philistines.”\x + \xo 3:14: \xt 1Sam 18:27.\x*
\v 15 \add So\add* Iysh-Boshet \add had her taken\add* from \add her\add* husband (Laish’s son Paltiel),
\v 16 \add but\add* he walked along behind her, weeping, as far as Bahurim \add where finally\add* Abner told him to go \add back home\add* and \add so he did\add*.
\p
\v 17 Then Abner conferred with the Israeli elders saying, “\add Previously\add* you were wanting David to be king over you,
\v 18 \add but now it’s time for action\add*. Yahweh has \add already\add* said, ‘\add I’m going to use\add* my servant David to rescue my people Yisrael from the Philistines and all their \add other\add* enemies.’ ”
\v 19 Abner also spoke \add privately with the Benyamites\add*, then he went to Hebron to tell David \add privately what the Israelis and the Benyamites had agreed to\add*.
\p
\v 20 Then Abner took twenty men and went to David at Hebron, and David put on a feast for \add all of them\add*.
\v 21 Abner \add asked\add* David, “My master, the king. Let me get \add ready\add* and go, and let me \add encourage\add* all of Yisrael that they’ll \add make an agreement\add* with you so that you will be king over \add the entire area as you’ve been wanting\add*.” \add So\add* David sent Abner, and he went in peace.
\s1 Yoav murders Abner
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 22 \add Soon afterwards,\add* Yoav and some of David’s \add men\add* arrived after a raid and \add carried in\add* a lot of plunder. (Abner had already left Hebron because \add David\add* had sent him off and he’d left in peace.)
\v 23 \add When\add* Yoav and all the fighters with him arrived, \add he\add* was told that Abner had been there and spoken with the king, then sent away in peace.
\v 24 \add So Yoav\add* went to the king and \add demanded\add*, “What have you done? Abner came to you \add and I can’t believe that you’d let him go, but he’s definitely not here now\add*.
\v 25 \add Surely you realise that\add* \add he\add* \add only\add* came \add here to influence you and to find out where you’re coming from and going to, and to learn everything\add* that you’re doing?”
\p
\v 26 \add Once Yoav had finished talking to\add* David, he sent messengers \add to catch up to\add* Abner. They \add found him\add* at the Sirah cistern and brought him back \add without David’s knowledge\add*.
\v 27 \add When\add* Abner got back to Hebron, Yoav took him aside at the \add city\add* gate as if to speak to him privately, then \add stabbed\add* him in the stomach and he died \add as vengeance for killing\add* \add Yoav’s\add* brother Asah-El.
\v 28 \add Later\add* \add when\add* David heard about it, he \add declared\add*, “I and my kingdom are innocent \add of Abner’s death in Yahweh’s eyes\add*.
\v 29 \add May Yoav’s extended family continually suffer from sores or leprosy, and be forced into manual labour or be killed in battle, or run out of food to eat\add*.”
\v 30 (\add That’s how\add* Yoav and his brother Abishai murdered Abner because he’d killed their brother Asah-El in Gibeon during the war.)
\s1 Abnir’s burial

\p
\v 31 Then David \add instructed\add* Yoav and all the people with him, “Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and mourn \add for\add* Abner.” \add Later at the funeral,\add* King David walked behind the \add coffin\add*
\v 32 and they buried Abner in Hebron. The king \add cried loudly\add* at the tomb, and the people \add also\add* wept.
\v 33 The king \add sang this song\add* for Abner:
\q1 “Abner shouldn’t have died as if \add he was just some drunken fool\add*.
\q1
\v 34 \add He wasn’t handcuffed or with his feet in chains\add*.
\q1 \add He fell like someone disturbing a burglar.\add*”
\m And \add so\add* the people wept even more for him.
\p
\v 35 \add Many people brought food\add* to David during the day, but he promised, “\add May God severely punish me if I eat anything\add* before the sun goes down.”
\v 36 All the people recognised \add David’s dignity in handling this matter and were pleased with his behaviour, just as they were pleased with everything that the king did\add*,
\v 37 and \add everyone throughout Yisrael knew that the king hadn’t ordered for Abner (Ner’s son) to be executed\add*.
\v 38 Then the king told his servants, “Don’t you all \add realise that Yisrael lost a leader and a great man today\add*?
\v 39 Although I was anointed as king, I \add feel tender\add* today. Those sons of Zeruyah \add are more violent\add* than me. May Yahweh repay \add evil people appropriately for their actions\add*.”

\p
\v 1 \add When\add* Sha’ul’s son \add Iysh-Boshet\add* heard that Abner had \add been killed\add* in Hebron, \add he lost courage\add* and all Yisrael was horrified.
\v 2 \add He\add* had two men who were \add leaders of raiding parties\add*. They were Rimmon’s sons Baanah and Rekav from Beerot in the Benyamite region,
\v 3 \add but\add* the \add people from Beerot\add* had fled to Gittaim where they’ve stayed until now.
\p
\v 4 (Sha’ul’s son Yonatan had a son named Mefiboshet. He was \add five years old\add* when the report about Sha’ul and Yonatan’s \add death\add* came from Yezreel. \add Mefiboshet’s\add* \add nanny\add* picked him up \add to run to safety, but in her hurry\add* he fell and \add became crippled in his legs\add*.)\x + \xo 4:4: \xt 2Sam 9:3.\x*
\p
\v 5 \add One day,\add* Baanah and Rekav (the sons of Rimmon from Beerot) walked to Iysh-Boshet’s house, \add arriving in the middle of the day when he was taking a nap\add*.
\v 6-7 They entered the middle of the house \add as if getting wheat\add*, then \add entered\add* the inner room where @Iysh-Boshet was on the bed. They struck him in the \add body\add*, killing him, then they cut off his head. Then Rekav and Baanah took the head and escaped, and walked all night through the Arabah.
\v 8 They took Iysh-Boshet’s head to David at Hebron and told the king, “Look, \add here’s\add* the head of Ishbosheth, the son of your enemy Sha’ul who \add tried to kill you\add*. Today Yahweh’s given vengeance to my master the king against Sha’ul and his \add descendants\add*.”
\p
\v 9 Then David answered Rekav and his brother Baanah (the sons of Rimmon from Beerot), “\add As Yahweh lives, having\add* delivered my life from every distress,
\v 10 when the \add messenger came to Tsiklag thinking he was bringing me good news and told me that Sha’ul was dead, I had him seized and executed\add*.\x + \xo 4:10: \xt 2Sam 1:1-16.\x*

\v 12 Then David commanded \add some of\add* the young men and they killed \add the two brothers\add* and cut of their hands and feet and hung \add them\add*\f + \fr 4:12 \ft It’s ambiguous in the Hebrew whether the hands and feet were strung up, or the actual bodies.\f* beside the Hebron pool, \add but\add* they took Iysh-Boshet’s head and buried it \add there\add* in Hebron in Abner’s tomb.

\v 17 \add When\add* the Philistines heard that David had been \add proclaimed\add* as king over \add all\add* Yisrael, \add their army set off to capture\add* \add him\add*, \add but\add* David heard and \add retreated\add*\f + \fr 5:17 \ft The Hebrew says ‘descended’, but doesn’t tell us either from where (probably Yerushalem) or to where (possibly Masada).\f* to the stronghold.
\v 18 The Philistines \add moved in\add* and took over the Rafa valley,

\p “\add Yes,\add* \add attack them\add*,” Yahweh \add replied\add*, “because I’ll certainly \add help you to defeat them\add*.”
\p
\v 20 \add So\add* David \add attacked\add* and \add defeated\add* them, and said, “Yahweh broke through my enemies \add in front of me like breaking a dam\add*.” So he called the place ‘Baal-Peratsim’ \add (which means ‘Master of breaking through’)\add*.
\v 21 \add The Philistines\add* left their idols there, and David and his men \add took them away\add*.

\v 24 Then when you hear a sound in the tops of the trees \add that sounds like marching, then you’ll know that Yahweh has gone ahead\add* to strike the Philistines’ camp.”

\v 1 Then David \add selected thirty thousand Israeli warriors and gathered them together\add*.
\v 2 \add He led them to\add* \add Kiriat-Yearim (formerly called\add* Baalah) in Yehudah to get the box of God (whose name is Yahweh the army commander) who lives between the two winged creatures on the top of it.\x + \xo 6:2: \xt Exo 25:22.\x*
\v 3 They \add placed the sacred chest\add* on a \add newly-made\add* cart and started moving it from Abinadab’s house which was on a hill. Uzzah and Ahyo (Abinadab’s sons) were leading the cart.\x + \xo 6:3: \xt 1Sam 7:1-2.\x*

\v 5 David and all the \add Israelis\add* were celebrating \add in God’s presence\add* with \add wooden\add* harps and lyres, along with tambourines, shakers, and cymbals.
\p
\v 6 \add But\add* when they reached Nakon’s threshing floor the oxen \add stumbled so\add* Uzzah reached out \add to steady the sacred chest\add*.
\v 7 Yahweh \add became furious with\add* Uzzah and \add killed\add* him \add right\add* there by the \add sacred chest because he’d touched it\add*.
\v 8 \add Now\add* David \add got angry\add* because of Yahweh’s outburst against Uzzah, and that place has been called Perets-Uzzah \add (meaning ‘The punishment of Uzzah’)\add* until today.
\v 9 David was afraid of Yahweh that day and asked, “How will Yahweh’s box \add get to Yerushalem\add*?”
\v 10 \add So\add* \add he\add* \add decided not to take\add* Yahweh’s box \add there\add* and \add redirected\add* it \add instead\add* to the house of Obed-Edom (a Gittite).

\p
\v 12 \add Someone told\add* King David, “Yahweh has blessed Obed-Edom’s \add household\add* because of the \add sacred chest,” so\add* David went and brought God’s Box from Obed-Edom’s house to \add Yerushalem with much happiness\add*.
\v 13 \add When the men who were carrying the sacred chest had walked\add* six steps, they stopped and \add David\add* sacrificed a \add bull and a fattened calf\add* \add there\add*.

\v 16 \add However\add*, as they were entering the city, \add David’s\add* wife Mikal (Sha’ul’s daughter) looked out the window and saw King David leaping and dancing \add in front of\add* Yahweh, and she \add felt only despite for\add* him.
\v 17 They took Yahweh’s box and placed it in the middle of the tent that David had erected for it. Then David \add offered burnt sacrifices\add* to Yahweh, as well as peace offerings.
\v 18 \add When\add* David \add had finished offering those sacrifices\add*, he blessed the people in commander Yahweh’s name.

\p
\v 20 Then David returned to bless his \add own\add* house, \add but his wife Mikal came\add* out to meet him \add complaining, “What disgraceful behaviour for Yisrael’s king today—dancing when he was wearing so little and exposing himself to his female servants like some brainless person\add*!”
\p
\v 21 “\add It was to thank\add* Yahweh,” David \add responded\add*, “who chose me (rather than your father and any of his family) by appointing me as leader over Yahweh’s people Yisrael. I was celebrating \add in front\add* of Yahweh

\p
\v 3 Then David \add defeated\add* Tsovah’s King Hadadezer (son of Rehov) \add who had tried to reestablish his authority over the Euphrates\add* River.
\v 4 David captured 1,700 horsemen and twenty thousand men on foot. \add He\add* hamstrung all the chariot \add horses\add* except for a hundred of them.

\v 8 \add Mefiboshet\add* \add bowed low and asked\add*, “Your servant’s \add nothing more than a\add* dead dog. \add Why would you care about\add* me?”

\p
\v 4 \add So\add* Hanun \add seized\add* David’s servants and had half of their beards shaved off and their robes cut in half \add all the way\add* up to their buttocks, then he sent them off.
\v 5 They \add sent messengers ahead\add* to tell David because they were very humiliated, and the king told them to stay in Yeriho before returning when their beards grew back.

\v 6 Then the \add Ammonite leaders realised that they’d now caused David to despise them, so\add* they hired twenty thousand \add Aramean\add* \add (or Syrian)\add* \add mercenaries\add* from Beyt-Rehob and Tsovah, and \add another\add* one thousand from Maakah and twelve thousand from Tov.

\v 5 \add After some time,\add* the woman \add realised that she\add* was pregnant, and \add so\add* she informed David.

\v 18 Then Yoav sent \add a messenger\add* to David \add to give him a full account of the battle\add*.
\v 19 He told the messenger, “\add Once you’ve finished telling all the details of the battle\add* to the king,
\v 20 if \add he\add* gets angry and \add asks\add*, ‘Why did you all \add go so close in\add* to the city to fight? Didn’t you know that they’d shoot \add down\add* from the wall?
\v 21 \add Wasn’t Yerub-Beshet’s son Abimilek killed by a woman in Tevets\add* when she threw a millstone down from the wall? Why did you approach the wall?’ Then you should say, ‘Your servant Uriyyah the Hittite is also dead.’ ”\x + \xo 11:21: \xt Jdg 9:53.\x*
\p
\v 22 \add So\add* the messenger left and went and told David everything that Yoav had told him,
\v 23 saying, “\add Their men gained ground and came out against us in the countryside, but we forced them back to their city\add* gate.
\v 24 Then \add their\add* archers were shooting at your men from \add the top of\add* the wall and \add some of your men were killed, including\add* your servant Uriyyah the Hittite.”
\p
\v 25 David \add sent the messenger back to encourage Yoav\add*, “Don’t let \add yourself be upset by what happened\add* because \add no one knows who might die in a battle\add*. \add Reinforce your battle\add* against the city and tear it down.”
\p
\v 26 \add When Uriyyah’s wife Batsheva heard that her husband had been killed\add*, she mourned for \add him\add*.
\v 27 \add When her time of mourning was over\add*, David sent for her and brought her to \add the palace\add*. She became a wife to him and bore a son for him, \add but Yahweh was unhappy about what\add* David had done.

\s1 Natan brings rebuke to David
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add So\add* Yahweh sent Natan to David \add to tell\add* him, “\add Once\add* \add there was a rich man and a poor man living in the same city\add*.\x + \xo 12:1: \xt Psa 51 header.\x*
\v 2 The rich man \add had a large number\add* of flocks and herds,
\v 3 \add but\add* the poor man only had one little female lamb that he’d bought. It grew up with him and his sons, and would eat his left-overs and drink from his cup and lay down in his lap—it was like a daughter to him.
\v 4 \add One day\add* the rich man \add had a visitor, but instead of taking one of his own animals for a meal, he killed the poor man’s lamb and prepared it for the meal for his guest\add*.”
\p
\v 5 David \add got very angry listening to that\add* and told Natan, “By the life of Yahweh, the man that did that \add definitely deserves to be put to\add* death!
\v 6 He must \add pay back four lambs\add* for doing that and for \add having no pity\add* \add on that poor man\add*.”
\p
\v 7 Then Natan said to David, “You are \add that rich\add* man. Yahweh, the God of Yisrael, says to you: ‘I myself anointed you as king over Yisrael, and I myself \add kept you safe from\add* Sha’ul.
\v 8 I gave you the house that belonged to your master, \add as well as\add* his wives. I \add made you king over\add* \add both\add* Yisrael and Yehudah. And \add if that wasn’t enough, I’ve given you more and more\add*.
\v 9 \add So\add* why have you despised \add my commands\add* by doing \add what you knew was evil\add*? You had Uriyyah the Hittite killed with \add an Ammonite sword\add* and you took his wife for yourself.
\v 10 \add So\add* now, because you despised me and took Uriyyah’s wife as your own, \add war and violence will never go away from you and your descendants\add*.
\v 11 \add I will cause a disaster to hit you from within your own household—I’ll take your wives and give them to a family member right in front of your eyes, and he will let everyone know that he’s sleeping\add* with your wives.\x + \xo 12:11-12: \xt 2Sam 16:22.\x*
\v 12 \add You did what you did\add* in secret, \add but\add* I myself will do all this \add in public\add* before all Yisrael.’”
\p
\v 13 “\add Yes,\add* I’ve sinned against Yahweh,” David \add responded\add* to Natan.
\p “Yahweh has taken away your sin,” Natan \add replied\add*. “You won’t die.
\v 14 Nevertheless, because you have utterly disrespected Yahweh in this matter, also your \add new\add* son is certainly going to die.”
\v 15 Then Natan went home.
\s1 David’s son dies
\s4 Full kingdom
\p Then Yahweh \add caused the baby (that Uriyyah’s wife had given birth to) to\add* get sick.
\v 16 David \add pleaded with\add* Yahweh for the boy’s sake, and he fasted, and he spent the \add entire\add* night lying down on the ground.
\v 17 The \add influential members\add* of his household got beside him to try to get him up from the ground, but he \add wouldn’t budge\add*, and he wouldn’t eat \add anything they brought\add*.
\v 18 Then on the seventh day, the baby died, \add but\add* David’s servants were afraid to tell him because \add after seeing his response when the child was sick, they were afraid of what he might do to himself when he found out that his son\add* had died.
\p
\v 19 \add However, when\add* David noticed his servants whispering together, he \add realised that the baby must have died, and he asked\add* \add them\add*, “Did the baby die?”
\p “\add Yes,\add*” they \add answered\add*, “he \add passed away\add*.”
\p
\v 20 Then David got up from the ground and washed, and he \add rubbed lotions on\add* and changed his clothes, then he entered Yahweh’s \add tent and worshipped him\add*. Then he \add went back home and asked for food to be served\add*, and he ate.
\p
\v 21 His servants \add queried\add* him, “\add We don’t understand what just happened: when the baby was alive you fasted and wept, but yet when he dies, you get up and have a meal?\add*”
\p
\v 22 “While the child was still alive,” David \add replied\add*, “I fasted and I wept, because I \add thought\add*, ‘Who knows? Yahweh might be gracious to me and let \add him\add* live.’
\v 23 \add But\add* now \add that\add* he’s dead, \add there’s no more reason\add* to fast—I can’t bring him back again. \add One day\add* I’ll go to him, \add but\add* he’ll \add never\add* come back \add here\add* to me.”
\v 24 Then David comforted his wife Batsheva.

\s1 Amnon rapes Tamar
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add Some time afterwards,\add* David’s son Amnon \add fell in love with his beautiful half-sister\add* Tamar (Abshalom’s sister),
\v 2 and \add he\add* \add made himself frustrated,\add* \add always thinking about her\add* because she was a virgin. However, \add he\add* \add couldn’t do anything with her\add*.
\v 3 \add But\add* Amnon had a very shrewd friend called Yonadab (son of David’s brother Shimeah)
\v 4 and \add Yonadab\add* \add asked\add* him, “\add Hey,\add* \add you’re a son of the king, so tell me why you’re always so unhappy\add*?”
\p “I’m in love with my brother Abshalom’s sister Tamar,” Amnon \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 5 “\add Go to bed\add* and pretend to be sick,” Yonadab \add suggested\add*. “Then \add when\add* your father comes to see you, \add ask\add* him, ‘Please let my sister Tamar come \add to look after my food. She can cook it here and serve it to me\add*.’ ”
\v 6 \add So\add* Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick, and \add when\add* the king came to see him, Amnon \add asked\add* \add him\add*, “Please, let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of bread rolls \add while I’m watching, and then she can serve them to me\add*.”
\p
\v 7 \add So\add* David sent \add a message\add* to Tamar \add to ask her to\add* go to her brother Amnon’s house and prepare food for him.
\v 8 \add So\add* Tamar went to her half-brother Amnon’s house where he was lying down. She took \add some\add* dough and kneaded it into breadrolls and baked them.
\v 9 Then she took the tray \add over to him\add*, but he refused to eat, saying, “\add Send everyone else out of here\add*,” \add so they all left\add*.
\v 10 Then Amnon told Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom so that \add you can serve it to me\add*.” \add So\add* Tamar took the breadrolls that she’d made, and took them to Amnon in the bedroom.
\v 11 \add But when she got close enough to him,\add* he grabbed her and insisted, “Come \add and\add* lie down with me, my sister.”
\p
\v 12 “No, my brother,” she told him, “don’t humiliate me because \add we Israelis don’t do that\add*. Don’t do this disgraceful thing.
\v 13 Where \add could I hide my shame\add*? And you—you’d be \add considered\add* a godless fool in Yisrael. \add Just speak to the king because he’d give me to you to marry\add*.”
\v 14 \add But he didn’t want her advice, and being\add* stronger than her, he humiliated her \add by forcing her down and raping\add* her.
\p
\v 15 \add Instantly,\add* Amnon hated her with terrible hatred—a much greater hatred than the love with which he’d loved her, and \add he\add* told her to get up and get out.
\p
\v 16 “No, \add no\add*.” she responded. “\add Sending me away would be even worse than what you just\add* did to me.”
\p \add But\add* he refused to listen to her
\v 17 and called his \add personal servant\add*. He told him to \add take\add* the woman away and send her outside and then lock the door behind her.
\v 18 (She was wearing the kind of long robe that the virgin daughters of the king wore as an outer garment.)
\p \add So the servant pushed\add* her outside and locked the door behind her.
\v 19 Then Tamar put ashes on her head and tore the long robe that she was wearing. She put her hand on her head and wailed as she walked \add home\add*.\f + \fr 13:19 \ft The ashes, tearing of clothes, putting hand on head, and wailing, were all cultural signs of mourning and distress.\f*
\v 20 Her brother Abshalom \add asked\add* her, “\add Did your half-brother Amnon mess\add* with you? But now, my sister, \add don’t tell anyone since he’s your brother and don’t let it upset you\add*.” \add So\add* Tamar lived \add in a state of desolation\add* in her brother Abshalom’s house.
\p
\v 21 \add When\add* King David heard about all that, \add he got very angry\add*.
\v 22 \add Also,\add* Abshalom said nothing to Amnon (either good or bad) because he hated \add him\add* for humiliating his sister Tamar.
\s1 Abshalom kills Amnon
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 23 Two years passed, then Abshalom’s shearers were in Baal-Hatsor (near Efraim) and Abshalom \add invited\add* all the king’s sons.
\v 24 Abshalom went to the king and \add asked\add* him, “Listen, please, \add the shearers are working for\add* your servant. Please, let the king and his servants come with your servant.”
\p
\v 25 “No, my son,” the king \add replied\add*. “\add There’s too many of us—it would be too expensive\add* for you.” \add Abshalom\add* he urged him, but he wouldn’t go, \add however\add* he did bless him.
\p
\v 26 “But if \add you don’t come\add*,” Abshalom \add insisted\add*, “please let my brother Amnon come with us.”
\p “Why should \em he\em* go with you?” the king \add asked\add*.
\v 27 \add But\add* Abshalom \add insisted, so\add* \add the king\add* \add agreed to\add* send Amnon and \add his\add* other sons.
\v 28 Then Abshalom \add prepared\add* his young men, “Listen now, when Amnon \add gets a bit drunk from\add* the wine and I tell you all, ‘Strike Amnon!’ then you’ll kill him. You all don’t \add need to\add* be afraid \add because\add* I myself am the one commanding you. Be courageous \add warriors\add*.”
\v 29 \add At the right time,\add* Abshalom’s servants did to Amnon what Abshalom commanded \add them\add*. All the rest of the king’s sons \add jumped\add* up and onto their mules and fled \add away\add*.
\p
\v 30 \add While they were still on the way\add*, David heard the news that Abshalom had struck all of his sons and killed them, and none were left alive.
\v 31 The king \add stood\add* up and tore his clothes, then he laid down on the ground. \add Meanwhile\add*, all his servants \add there\add* were tearing their clothes.
\v 32 Then Yonadab (David’s brother Shimeah’s son) \add spoke up\add*, “My master, don’t \add imagine that\add* all those young men, the king’s sons, have been murdered. \add I suspect that\add* only Amnon is dead, because Abshalom \add has been determined to do this ever since\add* his sister Tamar was humiliated.
\v 33 \add So my master, don’t believe the report that all your\add* sons are dead. \add It’s probably\add* only Amnon who’s dead.
\p
\v 34 \add Meanwhile,\add* Abshalom had fled.
\p \add Suddenly\add* the watchman \add turned\add* and saw, wow, many people coming around the hill along the road behind him.
\v 35 “Look,” Yonadab told the king. “The king’s sons are coming! \add It’s just what I said\add*.”
\v 36 He’d \add hardly\add* finished speaking when, wow, the king’s sons came in. Then they all cried loudly, and the king and his servants \add joined them in their wailing\add*.
\p

\v 38 \add After\add* Abshalom fled to Geshur, he stayed there for three years.

\s1 Abshalom returns to Yerushalem

\p
\v 1 \add Now\add* Yoav (Tseruyah’s son) \add realised\add* that the king \add missed\add* Abshalom,
\v 2 \add so\add* he sent for a wise woman from Tekoa and told her, “Now, please put on mourning clothes and don’t \add put on any make-up\add*. \add Act\add* like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for \add several\add* days,
\v 3 and go to the king and \add give him this message\add*.” Then Yoav told her what to say to the king.
\p
\v 4 \add So\add* the Tekoan woman went to the king and \add fell onto her knees with his face down to the ground\add*, saying, “\add Your majesty, help\add* \add me\add*.”
\p
\v 5 “What’s \add the matter\add*?” the king \add asked\add*.
\p “Alas, I’m a widow,” she \add replied\add*. “My husband has died.
\v 6 Your female servant had two sons, and the two of them fought \add each other out\add* in the countryside. There wasn’t anyone there who could \add stop\add* them, and then one \add son\add* struck the other and killed him.
\v 7 \add Now\add* listen, the entire clan has \add turned against\add* your female servant and \add demanded\add*, ‘Give \add us\add* the one who \add killed\add* his brother, and we’ll kill him in exchange for the life of the brother that he killed. Also, \add it would mean that this evil thing couldn’t be passed on\add*.’ \add But that would leave me with no descendants to continue\add* my husband’s name.”
\p
\v 8 “Go \add home\add*,” the king told the woman, “and I’ll \add make a decision about what to do\add*.”
\p
\v 9 \add But\add* the Tekoan woman \add continued\add*, “The \add blame\add*,\f + \fr 14:9 \ft Presumably for not putting the murderer to death.\f* my master the king, \add will be on me and my extended family, but\add* the king and his throne will be innocent.”
\p
\v 10 “Anyone who speaks against you,” said the king, “bring them to me, and then they won’t \add trouble\add* you any more.”
\p
\v 11 “Please,” she \add insisted\add*, “may the king \add ask\add* your God Yahweh to prevent the avenger of blood from increasing the \add tragedy\add*, so my son won’t be destroyed.”
\p “As surely as Yahweh lives,” he \add vowed\add*, “not a hair from your son’s head will fall to the ground.”
\p
\v 12 Then the woman said, “Please, let your female servant \add ask\add* my master the king \add a question\add*.”
\p “Speak,” he \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 13 \add So\add* the woman \add asked\add*, “Why have you \add acted\add* like this against God’s people? When the king says that \add to me\add*, isn’t he convicting himself since he hasn’t \add brought back\add* \em his own\em* \add banished son\add*?
\v 14 \add It’s certain that we’ll\add* \add all\add* die. Water that’s spilt on the ground can’t be gathered together \add again\add* \add but\add* God’s \add not like that\add*. Rather than taking away life, he devises plans so that the one who was banished can be \add gathered back in\add*.
\v 15 \add The reason\add* that I’ve come now to tell this to the king my master, is because the people have frightened me. \add So\add* your servant said \add to herself\add*, ‘I will speak, please, to the king. Perhaps the king will \add honour the request\add* of his female servant.
\v 16 \add Maybe\add* the king will listen in order to save his female servant from the man who’s \add cutting\add* me and my son together \add off\add* from the inheritance given by God.’
\v 17 And your female servant \add thought\add*, ‘Please, let the word of my master the king become \add my assurance\add*, because my master the king is like God’s messenger \add when it comes to\add* understanding good and evil. And may Yahweh your God be with you.’ ”\x + \xo 14:17: \xt 2Sam 19:27.\x*
\p
\v 18 “\add Hang on,\add*” the king told the woman. “\add I want you to answer this question honestly\add*.”
\p “Please, let my master the king speak.” \add she\add* \add responded\add*.
\p
\v 19 “\add Did Yoav perhaps have anything to do\add* with all this?” he \add asked\add*.
\p The woman answered, “By the life of your spirit, my master the king, there’s no \add avoiding anything\add* that my master the king has said. \add Yes,\add* your servant Yoav—he himself commanded me, and he himself \add told\add* your female servant \add what I should say\add*.
\v 20 Your servant Yoav \add set this up to try to remedy the situation\add*. But my master is wise like the wisdom of one of God’s messengers to know everything that’s \add going on here\add* on earth.”
\p
\v 21 Then the king \add summoned\add* Yoav and told him, “\add All right then,\add* I’ll \add sort this out. Now\add* go \add and\add* bring back the young man Abshalom.”
\p
\v 22 Yoav fell \add onto his knees and bowed\add* his face to the ground, and blessed the king, then he said, “Today, your servant knows that I have found favour in your eyes, my master the king, since the king \add is going to do what\add* his servant \add asked\add*.”
\v 23 Then Yoav got up and went to Geshur to get Abshalom and bring him \add back\add* to Yerushalem,
\v 24 \add but\add* the king said, “He can go around to his house, but he’s \add to stay right away from me\add*.” \add So\add* Abshalom \add lived in his own\add* house, \add but wasn’t allowed into the palace\add*.

\v 25 \add Now\add* Abshalom \add was admired as the most handsome man\add* in all Yisrael—from the \add top\add* of his head to the \add bottom\add* of his feet, \add you wouldn’t be able to find a blemish on his skin\add*.
\v 26 He \add had his hair cut once a year when it got too heavy on him, and when the hair was weighed using standard weights, it would be over two kilograms\add*.
\v 27 Abshalom had three sons and a daughter named Tamar—a very attractive woman.
\p
\v 28 Abshalom lived in Yerushalem for two years \add without ever getting to\add* see the king,
\v 29 \add so\add* \add he\add* \add sent a message\add* to Yoav \add about getting an invitation to see\add* the king, but \add Yoav\add* wouldn’t come to him. He sent \add another message\add*, but \add Yoav\add* \add still\add* wouldn’t come,
\v 30 \add so\add* he \add instructed\add* his servants, “Listen, Yoav’s \add piece of land with a barley crop is nearby\add*. Go and set fire to it.” \add So\add* Abshalom’s servants \add burnt\add* \add Yoav’s barley\add*.\f + \fr 14:30 \ft TC: The Septuagint translation adds the following words here: “And Abshalom’s servants burnt them up.

\p
\v 31 Then Yoav went to Abshalom’s house and \add demanded\add*, “Why did your servants \add destroy my barley crop\add*?”
\p
\v 32 “Listen, I \add tried to contact\add* you,” Abshalom \add replied\add*. “I asked you to come here so that I could send you to the king \add to ask what the point was of bringing me here from Geshur\add* \add if I can’t see him\add*—\add I might as well have stayed back\add* there. \add So\add* now, \add help me to get invited to see\add* the king, and then if \add I’m considered guilty of a crime\add*, then let him kill me.”
\p
\v 33 \add So\add* Yoav went and informed the king, and he called for Abshalom. \add When he entered\add*, he \add knelt and bowed his face\add* to the ground \add in front of\add* the king, and then the king kissed \add him\add*.

\v 1 \add Sometime after all that\add*, Abshalom \add acquired\add* a chariot and horses and \add hired\add* fifty men to run ahead of him.
\v 2 \add He\add* would get up early and stand \add on the side of the road going in and out of the city\add*. \add Every time that someone came into the city to take a dispute to be settled by the king, Abshalom would ask them where they were from, and they’d reply with their city and tribe\add*,
\v 3 then \add he’d\add* say, “Listen, \add No doubt\add* what you’re saying is sensible and right, but the king hasn’t \add appointed anyone to listen to people from your area\add*.”
\v 4 Then Abshalom would \add add\add*, “\add If I was\add* appointed as judge, then every person with a dispute or case could come to me and \add obtain\add* justice.”
\v 5 Whenever anyone approached him to \add bow respectfully\add* to him, he would put out his hand and \add embrace\add* them and kiss them.
\v 6 Abshalom acted \add that way towards every Israeli\add* who came for \add a dispute to be settled by\add* the king, and \add in doing that\add* he stole the \add hearts\add* of the \add Israeli people\add*.
\p
\v 7 Four\f + \fr 15:7 \ft The Hebrew says forty years, but this is interpreted here as a scribal error.

\p
\v 9 “Go in peace,” the king \add responded, so\add* Abshalom \add left for\add* Hebron.

\v 14 \add So\add* David told his servants, “\add Pack up quickly and let’s get out of here, or else we won’t be able\add* to escape from Abshalom. \add Be fast in case he’s heading here soon\add* and overtakes us. \add That would be a massacre and the whole city would die from their swords\add*.”
\p
\v 15 “Your servants \add here\add* \add will do everything you tell us\add*,” they \add replied\add* to the king.
\v 16 \add So\add* the king left ten of his slave-wives to \add look after\add* the palace, \add but\add* he left with all his family.
\p
\v 17 \add So\add* the king departed with all his people, and they stopped at the last house.
\v 18 Then all his servants passed beside him to go ahead, along with his bodyguards (the Kerethites and the Felethites) and six hundred Gittites (from Gat).
\v 19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “\add You don’t have to come\add* with us. You’re a foreigner and an exile from your place, \add so you could\add* go back and stay with the \add new\add* king.
\v 20 \add You haven’t been here long\add*, and we don’t even know where we’re going. \add I certainly need to leave but you can return with your relatives\add*. \add May Yahweh show\add* kindness and faithfulness \add to you all\add*.”
\p
\v 21 “\add As Yahweh lives, and as my master the king lives\add*,” Ittai answered the king, “\add wherever my master the king goes\add*, your servant will certainly be there \add also\add*, whether \add it means life or death\add*.”
\p
\v 22 “\add Okay,\add* go \add ahead then\add*,” David told Ittai. \add So\add* Ittai and all his men and \add their families went with David\add*.
\v 23 \add All the people along the road cried when they saw them walking by\add*. The king and all the others crossed the Kidron riverbed and went up the hill toward the wilderness.
\p
\v 24 \add What a sight!\add* Even Tsadok and all the Levites with him were carrying the box with God’s agreement \add in it\add*, and when they put it down \add again\add*, \add the priest\add* Evyatar caught up \add to them and waited\add* until all the people had finished \add exiting\add* the city.
\v 25 \add But\add* the king told Tsadok, “\add Take the sacred chest back into\add* the city. If Yahweh favours me, then he’ll \add help\add* me return, and he’ll \add let\add* me see it and his \add place of residence\add* \add again\add*.
\v 26 \add But\add* if \add Yahweh\add* says that he isn’t pleased with me, then he’ll do to me \add whatever he thinks best\add*.
\v 27 \add Aren’t you a prophet\add*? Return to the city in peace, along with your son Ahimaats and Evyatar’s son Yonatan.
\v 28 Listen, I’ll wait at the fords in the wilderness until \add I get your message\add*.”
\v 29 \add So\add* Tsadok and Evyatar \add carried the sacred chest\add* back to Yerushalem, then they remained there.
\p
\v 30 \add As\add* David was going up the Mount of Olives, he was walking barefoot with his head covered. He was weeping as were the people with him—they \add too\add* had their heads covered and were weeping.
\v 31 David \add knew\add* that Ahitofel was among the people conspiring with Abshalom, \add so\add* \add he\add* \add prayed\add*, “Please, Yahweh, make Ahitofel \add give foolish advice\add*.”
\p
\v 32 \add When\add* David \add reached the summit\add* (where people \add frequently\add* worship God), Hushay (the Arkite) met him there. He had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head.
\v 33 David told him, “If you \add come\add* with me, you’ll be a burden to me,
\v 34 \add but\add* if you return to the city and tell Abshalom, ‘I’m your servant, \add my\add* king. I was your father’s servant \add in the past, but\add* now I’ll be your servant,’ then you’ll \add be able to oppose\add* Ahitofel’s counsel for me.
\v 35 The priests Tsadok and Evyatar \add are already\add* there, \add so tell\add* \add them\add* \add everything you hear in the palace\add*.
\v 36 \add Also\add* Tsadok’s son Ahimaats and Evyatar’s son Yonatan are there. \add Tell them everything\add* you hear, then send \add them to report it to me\add*.
\p
\v 37 \add So\add* David’s friend Hushay \add slipped back into\add* Yerushalem \add just as\add* Abshalom was entering the city.

\v 6 Then he threw stones at David and all \add his\add* servants, and all the people and \add warriors\add* on \add both sides\add* of \add the king\add*.
\v 7 “Go away, go away, you worthless man of \add much bloodshed\add*!” Shimei \add yelled\add*.
\v 8 “\add Now\add* Yahweh’s returning to you all the blood of Sha’ul’s household. You \add took over as\add* king in his place, \add but\add* Yahweh’s giving the kingdom into the hand of your son Abshalom. Look at you, you’re evil because you’re a man of \add much bloodshed\add*.”
\p
\v 9 The Tseruyah’s son Abishai \add asked\add* the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my master the king? Please, let me cross over and \add lop off\add* his head.”
\p
\v 10 “What \add does it matter\add* to me, or to you \add two\add* sons of Tseruyah?” the king \add replied\add*. “He’s cursing because Yahweh told him to curse \add me\add*, \add so who has any right to ask him why he’s saying it\add*?”
\v 11 Then David told Abishai and all his servants, “Look, my \add own biological son is trying to kill me\add*. \add Now on top of\add* that, this Benjaminite. Leave him and let him curse, because Yahweh \add told him to\add*.
\v 12 Perhaps Yahweh will see my suffering and return good on me, instead of this cursing today.”
\v 13 \add As\add* David and his men \add continued along\add* the road, Shimei walked along the hillside beside him—walking and cursing, and throwing stones and dirt at him.

\p
\v 15 \add Meanwhile,\add* Abshalom and \add all his followers\add* arrived in Yerushalem, and Ahitofel was among \add them\add*.
\v 16 \add When\add* David’s friend Hushay (the Arkite) came to Abshalom, he \add greeted\add* \add him\add*, “May the king live. May the king live.”
\p
\v 17 “Is \add that how you show\add* kindness to your friend \add David\add*?” Abshalom \add responded\add*. “Why didn’t you go with \add him\add*?”
\p
\v 18 “No,” Hushay \add replied\add*. “I’ll \add serve whoever\add* Yahweh and these people and all the men of Yisrael have chosen. \add So\add* I’ll stay with \add you\add*.
\v 19 \add Besides that\add*, who should I serve? \add Why shouldn’t I serve my master’s\add* son? Just as I’ve served your father, \add similarly, I’ll serve you\add*.”
\p
\v 20 Then Abshalom \add turned to\add* Ahitofel, “Give us advice. What should we do \add next\add*?”
\p
\v 21 “Go to your father’s slave-wives that he left to guard the house,” Ahitofel \add replied\add*. “\add Lie with them\add* then all Yisrael will hear that you’ve made your father stink, and then \add everyone\add* with you will be \add encouraged\add*.”
\v 22 \add So\add* they \add set up\add* a tent for Abshalom on the \add palace\add* roof and \add he\add* \add had sex\add* with his father’s slave-wives \add where everyone would know what was going on\add*.\x + \xo 16:22: \xt 2Sam 12:11-12.\x*
\p
\v 23 In those days, Ahitofel’s advice was just \add as good as inquiring directly from\add* God, \add so David in the past, and now Abshalom, accepted what he said\add*.

\s1 Hushay argues against Ahitofel’s advice

\p
\v 1 Then Ahitofel \add asked\add* Abshalom, “Please, let me choose twelve thousand men, then let me \add go\add* and pursue after David tonight.
\v 2 I’ll \add attack\add* him while \add they’re\add* tired and \add lacking energy\add*. \add Once I panic\add* \add them\add*, all the people with him will flee and I’ll be able to strike the king by himself.
\v 3 Then I’ll \add bring\add* all the people \add back\add* to you, like \add a reunion\add*. You’ll \add have\add* the man you’re \add wanting\add*, and all the people will be in peace.”
\v 4 \add That seemed very sensible to\add* Abshalom and all the Israeli elders.
\p
\v 5 \add But\add* Abshalom \add insisted\add*, “Now, call Hushay the Arkite \add as well\add*, and let’s also \add listen to his suggestions\add*.”
\v 6 \add So when\add* Hushay \add arrived\add*, Abshalom \add asked\add* him, “Ahitofel has \add suggested so and so\add*. Should we \add do what he said\add*? If not, \add what would you recommend?\add*”
\p
\v 7 “This time, Ahitofel’s suggestion isn’t \add such\add* good advice,” Hushay \add replied\add*.
\v 8 You yourself know your father and his men—\add and do remember\add* that they’re \add powerful warriors\add*—they’re \add still furious\add* like a bear in the countryside \add that’s been robbed of its cubs\add*. And your father is an \add experienced\add* man of war, and he won’t spend the night \add there\add* with the people.
\v 9 Listen, he’s \add probably\add* \add already hiding in a cavern or some other place\add*. \add Also,\add* if \add some of your men\add* were killed early \add in the fighting\add*, \add then the rumour would go around that Abshalom’s already lost many men\add*.
\v 10 Then \add even your bravest warriors might lose heart\add*, because all Yisrael knows that your father is a \add powerful warrior\add*, and \add also\add* that the men with him are \add very experienced\add*.
\v 11 \add So this is what I suggest\add*: \add Call warriors from\add* all Yisrael—from Dan \add in the far north\add* to Beer-Sheva \add in the far south\add*. They’ll be as numerous as sand \add grains\add* on the beach and you \add personally will be able to lead them into\add* battle.
\v 12 Then we’ll \add be able to find him wherever he is\add*, and \add attack him like dew blankets the entire area\add*, and neither him nor any of the men with him \add will survive\add*, not even one.
\v 13 If he \add escaped into some\add* city, \add we’d all\add* bring ropes to that city and drag \add the stones\add* into the valley until even a pebble couldn’t be found there.”
\p
\v 14 Abshalom and all the \add Israeli elders agreed that Hushay’s advice was better than Ahitofel’s\add*. (Yahweh had \add influenced\add* them to reject Ahitofel’s good advice so \add he\add* could bring disaster onto Abshalom.)

\p
\v 15 Then Hushay told the \add two\add* priests Tsadok and Evyatar what Ahitofel had suggested to Abshalom and the Israeli elders and \add what he’d countered it with\add*.
\v 16 Then \add he told them\add*, “\add Get that message to\add* David quickly. \add Tell him\add* not to \add overnight\add* at the fords in the wilderness, but to cross over otherwise he’ll be killed \add along with everyone else\add* with him.”
\p
\v 17 \add Their sons\add* Yonatan and Ahimaats were waiting at Eyn-Rogel \add where\add* a female servant would come and \add pass the message onto\add* them, because it \add wouldn’t be safe for them\add* to be seen entering the city. Then they themselves would go and inform King David.
\v 18 \add But\add* a young man saw them and informed Abshalom, \add but\add* \add meanwhile\add* the two of them went quickly and got to the house of a man in Bahurim \add where\add* they went down into the well in his courtyard.
\v 19 The woman \add there\add* stretched a covering over the top of the well, and then spread grain over it \add to dry\add*, so \add it wasn’t obvious\add*.
\v 20 \add Some of\add* Abshalom’s servants \add arrived at the house and asked\add* the woman, “Where’s Ahimaats and Yonatan?”
\p “They crossed over the creek,” she \add replied\add*.
\p \add So they continued searching for them, but gave up\add* \add after a while\add* and returned to Yerushalem.
\p
\v 21 \add After they’d gone\add*, \add the two men\add* \add climbed\add* out of the well, and went \add on\add* and informed King David, “\add Pack\add* up and quickly cross over the river, because Ahitofel \add suggested attacking you all immediately\add*.”
\v 22 \add So\add* David and everyone with him \add moved on\add* and crossed the Yordan \add in the night, and by dawn there were all across\add*.
\p
\v 23 \add When\add* Ahitofel saw that his \add advice hadn’t been taken\add*, he saddled his donkey and \add rode\add* to his city. He gave instructions to his \add household\add*, then he hanged himself. \add His body\add* was buried in his father’s tomb.

\v 25 As the \add replacement\add* for Yoav as army \add commander\add*, Abshalom had appointed Amasa. (He was Yeter’s son, and his mother was Nahash’s daughter Abigail who was the sister of Yoav’s mother Tseruyah.)
\v 26 Abshalom and \add his men\add* camped in the Gilead \add region\add*.

\v 28 \add brought\add* bedding and basins, clay pots, wheat and barley, flour and roasted grain, beans and lentils,

\v 1 David \add divided his warriors into units\add* and appointed commanders of hundreds and of thousands.
\v 2 \add He\add* \add sent them out in three groups under\add* Yoav, Abishai (son of Yoav’s brother Tseruyah) and Ittai (the Gittite), then \add promised that he’d also join them in battle\add*.
\p
\v 3 \add But\add* the people \add complained\add*, “\add No,\add* don’t go out, because if we \add have to\add* flee, they won’t \add be worried about\add* us. \add Even\add* if half of us die, they won’t \add be worried about\add* us, because you \add count more to them than ten thousand of us\add*. \add So\add* it’s better that you \add stay to\add* help us from the city.”
\p
\v 4 “I’ll do whatever seems best to you,” the king \add responded\add*. \add So\add* the king stayed beside the city gate while the \add men\add* went out by their hundreds and thousands.
\v 5 Then he commanded Yoav and Abishai and Ittai, “\add For my sake, don’t harm my son\add* Abshalom.” All the people heard the king \add give this command\add* about Abshalom \add to all the leaders\add*.
\p
\v 6 So \add David’s\add* people went out to the countryside to meet \add the rest of\add* Yisrael. The battle was in the Efraim forest
\v 7 and David’s \add men defeated the rest—twenty thousand men died\add* that day,
\v 8 \add but\add* as the battle had spread over the \add entire area\add*, the forest killed more people that day than the sword.
\p
\v 9 Abshalom happened to meet some of David’s \add men\add*. \add He\add* was riding his mule, and when \add it\add* \add darted\add* under the think branches of a large terebinth \add tree\add*, his head got caught in the branches and he was \add left hanging in the air\add* as the mule \add kept going\add*.
\v 10 \add Someone noticed him\add* and informed Yoav that he’d seen Abshalom hanging in a tree.
\p
\v 11 “\add What!\add*. You saw \add him\add* \add but didn’t strike him down\add*?” Yoav \add challenged\add*. “\add I would have given\add* you ten silver \add coins\add* and a \add leather\add* belt.”
\p
\v 12 “Even if \add you’d placed one thousand silver coins in my hands\add*,” \add he\add* \add replied\add*, “I wouldn’t have \add harmed\add* the king’s son, because \add we heard the king’s command with our own ears about looking out for\add* Abshalom.
\v 13 \add Even if I’d ignored my good sense, the king would have found out about it, then even you wouldn’t have stood up for\add* me.”
\p
\v 14 “\add I’m not going to waste time arguing with you\add*,” Yoav responded, then he took three spears \add and went\add* and thrust them into Abshalom’s \add abdomen\add* while he was \add still alive and dangling from the tree\add*.
\v 15 Then ten young men who carried Yoav’s weapons surrounded Abshalom and \add finished him off\add*.
\p
\v 16 Then Yoav blew the trumpet \add to signal the end of the fighting\add* and the people returned from chasing \add Abshalom’s men\add*.
\v 17 They took Abshalom’s \add body\add* and threw it into a large pit in the forest and covered it with a large pile of stones. \add Meanwhile\add* \add his men\add* fled back to their homes.
\p
\v 18 \add During his lifetime,\add* Abshalom had setup a pillar in the King’s Valley because \add he had no sons to preserve his name\add*. He \add put his name on\add* the pillar and it’s known as ‘Abshalom’s hand’ to this day.

\p
\v 20 “\add No, not today\add*,” Yoav \add replied\add*. “\add Some other time I’ll allow you to take some news, but not today\add* because the king’s son is dead.”
\v 21 Then Yoav instructed a Cushite man, “Go and tell the king what you saw.”. The \add man\add* bowed to Yoav and ran \add off\add*.
\p
\v 22 \add But\add* Ahimaats \add begged\add* Yoav again, “\add Regardless of what might happen\add*, please, let me also run myself after the Cushite.”
\p “Why \add would you do that\add*, my \add boy\add*?” Yoav \add asked\add*. “\add There won’t be any reward for\add* \add bad\add* news.”
\p
\v 23 “\add No matter what, I want to\add* run,” \add he replied\add*.
\p “\add Okay then,\add* run,” Yoav told him. \add So\add* Ahimaats \add took a different route through\add* the Yordan valley and \add arrived before\add* the Cushite.
\p
\v 24 \add Now\add* David was sitting between the \add outer and inner\add* gates. \add When\add* the watchman had gone over the gate roof to the wall, he \add looked out\add* and saw, wow, a man was running \add towards them\add* alone.
\v 25 The watchman called \add down\add* and informed the king, and the king said, “If he’s alone, \add he’ll be bringing\add* news.”
\p \add As the runner got closer\add*,
\v 26 the watchman looked and saw another man running. \add He\add* called \add down\add* to the gatekeeper and said, “Look, there’s \add another\add* man running alone.”
\p “He’ll also be bringing news,” said the king.
\p
\v 27 “The \add gait\add* of the first runner is like that of Tsadok’s son Ahimaats,” the watchman said.
\p “He’s a good man and he’ll be bringing good news,” said the king.
\p
\v 28 Then Ahimaats called \add ahead\add* to the king, “Peace!” And he \add knelt down with his face\add* to the ground and said, “Blessed be Yahweh your God, who’s \add stopped\add* the men who \add acted\add* against my master the king.”

\v 29 “Is the young man Abshalom all right?” the king \add asked\add*.
\p “When Yoab sent \add me\add*, your servant,” Ahimaats \add answered\add*, “I \add noticed a big\add* commotion, but I don’t know what \add it was about\add*.”
\p
\v 30 “\add Go and stand over there\add*,” the king \add ordered\add*, so he \add stepped aside\add* and stood \add there\add*.

\v 4 \add But\add* the king covered his face and \add kept\add* crying out loudly, “Oh my son Abshalom. Oh Abshalom, my son, my son.”
\p
\v 5 Then Yoav went to the house \add where\add* the king was and said, “Today you’ve \add made your followers feel ashamed\add*—the ones who saved your life today and the lives of your sons and daughters, and the lives of your wives and your slave-wives.
\v 6 By loving those who hate you and hating those who love you, you’ve \add effectively\add* declared today that your officers and men \add mean\add* nothing to you. \add It seems to us that\add* if Abshalom was still alive today and we were all dead, then it \add would have all been okay to you\add*.
\v 7 \add So\add* get up now and go and speak \add sincerely\add* to your servants, because \add as Yahweh lives\add*, if you don’t then you won’t have a single warrior still with you by the end of the night, and \add that would result in\add* more trouble for you than \add anything else that’s happened\add* to you since you were \add just\add* a lad.”

\v 10 We anointed Abshalom to be over us, but he died in the battle. So why \add aren’t we doing something\add* about returning \add David as\add* king?”
\p
\v 11 \add So\add* King David sent the \add two\add* priests Tsadok and Evyatar to the leaders of Yehudah \add to ask\add*, “Why are you the last \add group\add* to return the king to \add the palace since the king has heard that the rest of Yisrael want it\add*?
\v 12 \add Tell them,\add* ‘You’re all my relatives—my own flesh and blood, \add so\add* why \add would\add* you be the last to \add support me\add* \add again\add*?’ ”
\v 13 And tell Amasa, ‘Aren’t you my \add own\add* flesh and bone? May God \add make me suffer\add* if you don’t become my army commander \add from now on, to replace\add* Yoav.’ ”
\v 14 \add In that way,\add* \add David\add* \add united all the people\add* of Yehudah and they \add notified\add* the king, “\add We all want\add* you and all your servants to return \add here\add*.”

\v 20 because your servant knows that I myself have sinned, and look, I have come today, first of all the Yosef’s clans to come down to meet my master, the king.”

\p
\v 26 “My master the king,” Mefiboshet \add replied\add*, “my servant deceived me. I, your servant, had said to get my donkey saddled so I could ride it and go with \add you\add*, because \add as you know,\add* your servant is lame.
\v 27 Then my servant \add lied to you about me\add*. \add But\add* my master the king is like God’s messenger, so do \add whatever you consider to be appropriate\add*.

\v 32 At eighty, \add he\add* was very old, \add but being very wealthy, he’d provided food and supplies\add* to the king while he’d stayed at Mahanayim,
\v 33 \add so\add* the king told \add him\add*, “You cross over with me, and I’ll provide for you to be with me in Yerushalem.”
\p
\v 34 “How \add much longer am I likely to live\add*?” Barzillai \add pondered\add*. “\add Would it really be worth me moving\add* to Yerushalem with the king?
\v 35 \add Your servant is eighty years old\add*. \add My mind isn’t the same as it was, and I can’t really taste what I\add* eat or drink. \add I can barely hear the sounds\add* of the men and women singing. \add So\add* why would your servant become an extra burden to my master the king?”
\v 36 \add As a token privilege\add*, your servant will cross the Yordan with the king, \add but\add* why should the king reward me with that \add generous\add* reward?
\v 37 Please, let your servant return, and let me die in my city \add near\add* the graves of my \add parents\add*. \add But\add* look, \add here’s\add* your servant Kimham—let him cross over with my master the king, and do \add whatever you consider to be appropriate\add* for him.”

\v 38 “Kimham can cross over with me,” the king said, “and I myself will do for him \add whatever\add* \em you\em* \add consider to be appropriate\add*—everything that you choose concerning me, I’ll do for you.”

\p
\v 42 All the men of Yehudah answered the men of Yisrael, “Because the king is \add from our tribe\add*—\add our close relative\add*. \add Why should that make you all angry\add*? \add Do you all think that the king has rewarded us with fancy food or other privileges\add*?”
\p
\v 43 The men of Yisrael answered the men of Yehudah, “\add Our ten tribes\add* \add give us ten shares\add* in the king—more than you. \add So\add* why \add do you look down on us\add*? \add Weren’t we the first to talk about bringing our\add* king back \add to Yerushalem\add*?”

\v 1 \add Now there was\add* a good-for-nothing Benyaminite man named Sheva who was Bikri’s son, and he blasted on the trumpet, then said,
\q1 “\add We have no interest\add* in David,

\q1 \add Go home every man from\add* Yisrael.”\x + \xo 20:1: \xt 1Ki 12:16; 2Ch 10:16.\x*
\p
\v 2 \add So\add* all the men of Yisrael \add left\add* David \add and went with\add* Sheva (Bikri’s sons), but the men of Judah \add stayed with\add* their king from the Yordan river and uphill to Yerushalem.
\p
\v 3 \add When\add* David \add got back to his Yerushalem palace\add*, the ten slave-wives that he’d \add left behind\add* to guard the \add palace, \add he\add* \add moved\add* into a separate house\add*. \add That place was\add* guarded and he provided for them, but he didn’t \add sleep with\add* them—\add thus\add* they were locked up until \add they died living as widows\add*.\x + \xo 20:3: \xt 2Sam 16:22.\x*
\p
\v 4 \add One day\add* the king told Amasa \add (his new army commander)\add*, “Summon the men of Yehudah to \add be here in three days, and you be with them\add*.”
\v 5 \add So\add* Amasa went to summon \add them\add*, but he \add took longer than the given time\add*.
\v 6 \add Meanwhile\add* David told Abishai, “Bikri’s son Sheva will do more harm to us now than Abshalom. Take \add some of my warriors\add* and \add chase him down\add*, in case he finds \add some fortified city to hide in and gets away from us\add*.”
\v 7 \add So Yoav’s men and the king’s bodyguards\add* and all the \add best warriors\add* left Yerushalem to \add hunt Sheba down\add*.
\v 8 \add When they were approaching\add* the huge rock at Gibeon, they met Amasa. Yoav was \add dressed for battle with a dagger strapped to his waist under his robe\add*. \add As he stepped forward, he allowed his sword to drop to the ground\add* \add from his hand\add*.
\v 9 Yoav \add greeted\add* Amasa, “\add Is all well with\add* you, my brother?” Then he used his right hand to hold Amasa’s beard to kiss him,
\v 10 \add but\add* Amasa wasn’t aware of the dagger that was in Yoav’s \add other\add* hand. \add Yoav\add* thrust it into \add his\add* stomach and his intestines poured out on the ground. There was no need \add to stab him again\add* and \add Amasa\add* died \add right there\add*.
\p Then Yoav and his brother Abishai \add continued\add* \add their hunt for\add* Bikri’s son Sheva.
\v 11 One of Yoav’s young men stood beside \add Amasa’s body\add* and \add called out\add*, “Whoever favours Yoav and is for David, \add follow\add* Yoav.”
\v 12 \add Amasa’s bloody body\add* was in the middle of the road, and when the \add young\add* man saw that everyone was stopping to look at it, he \add dragged\add* \add it\add* off the road onto the \add grass\add* and threw a \add cloth\add* over it.
\v 13 \add After the body had been removed from the road,\add* all the men \add followed after\add* Yoav to chase Sheva.
\p
\v 14 \add Meanwhile\add* \add Sheva\add* crossed through all the \add tribal regions\add* of Yisrael to Abel-Beyt-Maacah \add where all his relatives gathered together and agreed to back him\add*.
\v 15 \add Yoav’s men\add* arrived and Abel-Beyt-Maacah. They heaped a siege ramp up against the city, and \add also\add* \add pounded\add* the wall to \add try to make it\add* \add collapse\add*.
\v 16 Then a wise woman called out from the city, “Listen, listen, please tell Yoav to come closer \add so I can speak to him\add*.”
\v 17 \add Yoav\add* \add went in closer\add* and \add she\add* asked, “Are you Yoav?”
\p “I am,” he \add replied\add*.
\p “Listen to \add what your servant has to say\add*,” she said.
\p “I’m listening,” he \add answered\add*.
\p
\v 18 Then she told him, “\add Long ago people used to tell others to come here to Abel to get advice, and they’d do that and then be able to settle the matter\add*.
\v 19 I’m a peaceable and faithful \add citizen\add* of Yisrael. You’re \add trying\add* to destroy \add this\add* city and a mother in Yisrael. Why would you \add wipe out our\add* inheritance from Yahweh?”
\p
\v 20 “Far be it, far be it for me that I would \add destroy or wipe it out\add*,” Yoav replied.
\v 21 \add That’s not what we’re here for\add*. \add We’re here\add* for a man from the Efraim hills named Sheva, the son of Bikri. He \add took a stand\add* against the king—against David. \add Just\add* \add hand him over to us, and then we’ll leave your\add* city.”
\p “\add Wait\add*,” the woman told Yoav. “His head will be thrown over the wall to you.”
\v 22 \add So\add* the woman went to all the people \add with\add* her wisdom, and they \add decapitated\add* Sheva, and threw \add his head\add* \add down\add* to Yoav.

\v 2 (The Gibeonites were not \add native Israelis\add*, but were a remnant of the Amorites. The Israelis had \add promised to protect them\add*, but Sha’ul had attempted to \add eliminate\add* them in his zeal for the people of Yisrael and Yehudah.) \add So\add* the king summoned the Gibeonites and \add asked\add* them,\x + \xo 21:2: \xt Josh 9:3-15.\x*
\v 3 “What can I do for all of you? How can I \add remedy\add* \add what was done in the past\add* so that you all would bless Yahweh’s \add people\add*?”
\p
\v 4 “\add We have no claim\add* to gold or silver from Sha’ul or his household,” the Gibeonites \add replied\add*, “And \add we don’t wish to have anyone\add* in Yisrael put to death.”
\p “Then what are you saying that I can do for you all?” he \add asked\add*.
\p
\v 5 “That man who \add crushed\add* us,” they \add replied\add*, “and who intended \add that we be annihilated from within\add* Yisrael’s borders,

\p “\add Okay\add*, I’ll give them to you,” the king \add responded\add*.

\q1 The one who rules \add people with justice\add*,
\q1 →rules out of his respect for God.
\q1
\v 4 He’s like the rising sun bringing the morning light—
\q2 a cloudless morning.
\q1 Glistening after the rain \add that grows\add* fresh grass from the soil.

\q1
\v 5 My \add household is aligned\add* with God,
\q1 because he made a perpetual agreement with me—
\q2 all arranged and secured.
\q1 He’ll make my salvation and every desire grow. ???
\q1
\v 6 But evil \add people\add* are like \add thorns\add*—
\q2 they’re all thrown away.
\q1 because they \add injure your hands\add*.
\q2
\v 7 Anyone who \add wants to\add* \add move\add* them
\q2 \add must use a metal tool or a wooden stick\add*.
\q1 They they’ll be \add incinerated right there\add*.”
\s1 David’s top warriors
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (1 Chr. 11:10-41)
\p
\v 8 These are the names of David’s \add top\add* warriors:
\p \bd Yoshev-Bashshevet\bd* the Tahkemonite was the head of ‘The Three’. One time he attacked and killed eight hundred men with his spear.
\p
\v 9 Next after him was \bd Eleazar\bd*, the son of Ahohi’s son Dodo. \add Once he was\add* among the three powerful warriors with David when they taunted the Philistines who were gathered there for battle. The Israeli warriors \add retreated back up\add* their hill,
\v 10 \add but\add* \add Eleazar\add* \add moved forward and attacked the Philistines until his arm became weak, and his hand cramped around\add* his sword. Yahweh \add achieved\add* a great victory that day, and the \add other warriors\add* only returned afterwards to plunder \add the dead\add*.
\p
\v 11 Then there was Agge’s son \bd Shamma\bd*, the Hararite. The Philistines had assembled in formation where there happened to be a field full of lentils. The \add Israelis\add* fled from the Philistines
\v 12 \add but\add* \add Shamma\add* remained there in the middle of the field and killed \add many\add* Philistines. \add So the field was saved\add*, and Yahweh \add achieved\add* a great victory.
\p
\v 13 \add Once\add* as it was approaching harvest time, three of ‘The Thirty’ went to where David \add had been staying\add* at Adullam’s cave. There was a Philistine unit camped in the Refaim valley.
\v 14 At the time, David was in the fortress, and there was \add another\add* Philistine unit in Beyt-Lehem.
\v 15 David \add was thirsty\add* \add one day\add* and \add asked\add*, “Who’ll \add get me a drink of water\add* from the Beyt-Lehem well by the gate?”
\v 16 \add So\add* the three powerful warriors \add broke through\add* the Philistine camp and got water from the Beyt-Lehem well near the gate. They carried it back to David, but he wouldn’t drink it—pouring it out instead \add as an offering\add* to Yahweh,
\v 17 saying, “Far be it for me, Yahweh, \add to drink\add* this—the blood of the men who \add risked\add* their lives.” \add So\add* he wasn’t willing to drink it.
\p Those \add were some of the\add* things done by ‘The Three’ powerful warriors.
\p
\v 18 Yoav’s brother \bd Abishai\bd* (Tseruyah’s sons) was the head over ‘The Three’. \add Once\add* he was \add used\add* his spear to kill three hundred \add fighters\add*, \add so he was more famous\add* than ‘The Three’.
\v 19 He was more honoured than ‘The Three’ and became their leader \add even though he wasn’t one of\add* ‘The Three’.
\p
\v 20 Yehoyada’s son \bd Benayah\bd* from Kavtsael was a man of military prowess with many deeds \add to his name\add*. \add Once\add* he killed ‘The Two’ from Moab, and \add another time\add* he went down in a pit on a snowy day and killed the lion in the pit.
\v 21 He \add also\add* killed an impressive Egyptian warrior with a spear, even though Benayah \add only held\add* a staff. \add First\add* he snatched the spear from the Egyptian’s hand, then he killed him with his \add own\add* spear.
\v 22 Those \add were some of the\add* things that Benayah did. He \add became famous\add* alongside ‘The Three’.
\v 23 (He was more honoured than ‘The Thirty’ but never entered ‘The Three’.) David appointed him over his bodyguard.
\p
\v 24 \add The following\add* were among ‘The Thirty’:
\li1 Yoav’s \add other\add* brother Asah-El,
\li1 Dodo’s son Elhanan from Beyt-Lehem,
\li1
\v 25 Shammah and Elika the Harodites,
\li1
\v 26 Helets the Paltite,
\li1 Ikkesh’s son Ira the Tekoite,
\li1
\v 27 Aviezer the Anatotite,
\li1 Mevunnai the Hushatite,
\li1
\v 28 Tsalmon the Ahohite,
\li1 Maharai the Netofatite,
\li1
\v 29 Baanah’s son Helev the Netofatite,
\li1 Rivai’s son Ittai from Gibeah (in Benyamin),
\li1
\v 30 Benayah the Piratonite,
\li1 Hiddai from the Gaash valleys,
\li1
\v 31 Avi-Albon the Arbatite,
\li1 Azmavet the Barhumite,
\li1
\v 32 Elyahba the Shaalvonite,
\li1 Yashen’s sons,
\li1 Yonatan,
\li1
\v 33 Shammah the Hararite,
\li1 Sharar’s son Ahiam the Hararite,
\li1
\v 34 Ahasbai’s son Elifelet the Maacatite,
\li1 Ahitofel’s son Eliam the Gilonite,
\li1
\v 35 Hezrai the Carmelite,
\li1 Paarai the Arbite,
\li1
\v 36 Natan’s son Yigal from Tsovah,
\li1 Bani the Gadite,
\li1
\v 37 Tselek the Ammonite,
\li1 Naharai the Beerotite who carried the weapons for Tseruyah’s son Yoav,
\li1
\v 38 the Yitrites Ira and Garev,
\li1
\v 39 and Uriyyah the Hittite.
\p \add There were\add* thirty-seven \add of them\add* \add in total\add*.

\s1 David takes a census
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (1 Chr. 21:1-27)
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh \add was angry\add* against Yisrael again and he incited David \add to cause problems for\add* them by saying, “Go \add and\add* \add order a census of\add* Yisrael and Yehudah.”
\v 2 \add So\add* the king told Yoav, the commander of his army, who was with him \add at the time\add*, “\add Travel throughout\add* all the \add regions of\add* the Israeli tribes, from Dan \add (in the far north)\add* down to Beer-Sheva \add (in the far south)\add*, and count the people so that I’ll know the number of \add fighting men\add*.”
\p
\v 3 “May your God Yahweh multiply the people a hundred times \add over\add*,” Yoav responded, “add may my master the king \add see that happen, but\add* why would my master the king \add want to do that\add*?”
\v 4 \add However,\add* the king \add insisted, so even though\add* Yoav and the army commanders \add disagreed\add*, \add at the king’s command\add* \add they\add* \add set off to count\add* the Israeli people.
\p
\v 5 They crossed the Yordan \add river\add* and camped in Aroer, south of the city in the middle of the Gad valley, then \add proceeded\add* to Yazer.
\v 6 Then they went \add north\add* to Gilead and the land of Tahtim-Hodshi, \add before\add* coming to Dan-Yaan and around to Tsidon.
\v 7 Then they came to the Tsor \add (Tyre)\add* fortress and all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites \add before going\add* \add east\add* to Beersheva in the Negev \add wilderness\add* (part of Yehudah).
\v 8 \add So they travelled throughout the land for\add* nine months and twenty days \add before returning\add* to Yerushalem.
\v 9 Then Yoav \add reported the census results\add* to the king: 800,000 fighting swordsmen in Yisrael, and 500,000 in Yehudah.
\p
\v 10 \add However, David had a guilty conscience\add* after he’d had the people counted and he told Yahweh, “I’ve \add disobeyed you badly, but\add* now, Yahweh, please \add take away\add* the iniquity of your servant because I’ve been very foolish.”
\p
\v 11 \add When\add* David got up in the morning, Yahweh \add gave\add* the prophet Gad \add this\add* message
\v 12 to take to David, “I, Yahweh, am \add offering you three choices\add*. \add You decide which one I should carry out against\add* you.”
\v 13 Then Gad \add asked\add* \add him\add*, “\add Do you want\add* seven years of famine in your country, or three months of fleeing from your enemies, or three days of plague in your country? \add Consider those and let me know which option to pass back\add* to the one who sent me.”
\p
\v 14 David \add answered\add* Gad, “\add This is very distressing\add*, \add but\add* please \add let Yahweh be the one to punish me because he’s very merciful—don’t let other men be the ones\add*.”
\p
\v 15 \add So\add* Yahweh \add sent\add* a plague to Yisrael from the morning and until the time \add he’d decided\add*. Seventy thousand people died from Dan \add in the north\add* \add down\add* to Beer-Sheva \add in the south\add*.
\v 16 \add When\add* \add Yahweh’s\add* messenger stretched out his hand to destroy Yerushalem \add with the plague\add*, Yahweh relented concerning the disaster and told the messenger who was \add destroying\add* many people, “Now lower your hand.” \add When he said that,\add* \add his\add* messenger was near the threshing floor of Aravnah the Yebusite.
\p
\v 17 David \add had complained\add* to Yahweh when he saw the messenger \add afflicting\add* the people, \add saying\add*, “Listen, \add it’s me alone who\add* sinned, and I myself \add who disobeyed you\add*. \add But\add* these \add innocent\add* \add people\add*—what have they done? Please, \add just punish only me and my relatives\add*.”
\s2 David builds an altar
\p
\v 18 Gad came to David that day, and \add instructed\add* him, “Go to the Yebusite Aravnah’s threshing floor \add and\add* \add build\add* an altar to Yahweh \add there\add*.”
\v 19 \add So\add* David went \add there just as Yahweh had instructed him through Gad’s message\add*.
\v 20 \add When\add* Aravnah looked \add out\add* and saw the king and his servants \add approaching\add*, \add he\add* went out and \add fell to his knees in front of the king and bowed his face\add* to the ground.
\v 21 “Why would my master the king come to his servant?” Aravnah asked.
\p “\add I want to buy your\add* threshing floor to build an altar for Yahweh,” David \add answered\add*. “\add So\add* that the plague \add afflicting\add* the people \add can be stopped\add*.”
\p
\v 22 “May my master the king take \add it\add*,” Aravnah responded. “\add Use it in whatever way you think best\add*. See, \add you can use\add* the oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing instruments and the oxen’s equipment for firewood.
\v 23 \add I\add* give \add it all\add* to \add you\add*, the king. May your God Yahweh accept your \add offering\add*.”
\p
\v 24 “No,” the king \add answered\add*. “I’ll definitely \add buy\add* it from you. I couldn’t \add offer something to\add* my God Yahweh \add that cost me\add* nothing.”
\v 25 \add So\add* David built an altar there to Yahweh, and he \add instructed for\add* burnt offerings and peace offerings to \add be made\add*. Then Yahweh \add accepted prayers for the country\add* and the plague against Yisrael was \add stopped\add*.
