\mt2 The accounts of
\mt1 Various Heroes and Guides
\mt3 commonly called ‘Judges’
\is1 Introduction
\ip This document commonly called ‘\bk Judges\bk*’, contains a collection of accounts of ‘\bk Various Heroes and Guides\bk*’ who helped to rescue the Israeli people from their oppressors. It covers the times from their invasion of Canaan through to just before their first king. Most of these heroes or guides were actually warriors. Shimshon (commonly called ‘Samson’) is the best-known of all of them, and his story can be read in chapters 13–16.
\ip From this document we can learn that Israel prospered when they obeyed Yahweh’s instructions, but when they disobeyed, then God allowed other peoples and nations to oppress them. However, God is always ready and prepared to save his people whenever they turn away from their disobedience and return again to obeying the instructions that he’d given them.
\ip The previous book was named after the main character Yehoshua (Joshua) and the following books (Ruth and 1 Shemuel/Samuel) are named after their main characters, but this document with somewhere around a dozen important characters, has no single prominent character that it could be named after. Instead it’s traditionally named ‘Judges’ in English because of around twenty uses of the Hebrew root ‘שָׁפַט’ (shafat) often in roots normally translated as ‘judged’. Despite that, there’s not a single account in this document of these leaders judging the cases and conflicts of the common people. This dilemma offers two possible interpretations: 1/ that these leaders (often military leaders) did judge cases for the common people, but those details aren’t recorded, or 2/ (which we’ve leaned more towards) that this Hebrew word has a wider range of meaning, and so we’ve leaned towards the English word ‘guided’ or ‘led’ in these contexts.

\s1 Yehudah and Simeon capture Adoni-Bezek
\p
\v 1 After Yehoshua’s death, the Israelis asked Yahweh, “\add Which tribe should go first to attack the Canaanites\add*?”
\v 2 “Yehudah will go first,” Yahweh \add answered\add*. “Listen, I’ve \add already determined that they’ll conquer\add* the land.”
\p
\v 3 Then the Yehudah \add leaders\add* said to \add the tribe of\add* Simeon, “\add Come\add* with \add us\add* into the region that we’ve been allocated and we can fight together against the Canaanites. Then we’ll do the same in your area.” So \add the warriors from the two tribes worked together\add*.
\v 4 When \add they\add* attacked, Yahweh \add gave them victory over\add* the Canaanites and the Perizzites and they killed ten thousand men at Bezek.
\v 5 They \add confronted\add* Adoni-Bezek in Bezek and fought against him (then eventually defeating the Canaanites and the Perizzites).
\v 6 Adoni-Bezek \add tried to\add* flee but they chased him and captured him, cutting off his thumbs and big toes.
\v 7 “Seventy kings had their thumbs and big toes chopped off,” Adoni-Bezek said, “and were gathering scraps of food beneath my table. Just as I have done, so God has repaid to me.” Then they took him to Yerushalem and he died there.
\s1 The capture of Yerushalem and Hebron
\p
\v 8 The warriors from Yehudah attacked Yerushalem and captured the city, killing the inhabitants and setting the city on fire.
\v 9 Then they fought against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the southern \add wilderness\add*, and in the \add western\add* foothills.
\v 10 \add They\add* also fought the Canaanites in Kiriath-Arba (now known as Hebron) and killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
\s1 Otniel captures Debir
\r (Josh. 15:13-19)
\p
\v 11 From there \add they\add* \add fought against\add* Kiriath-Sepher (now known as Debir).
\v 12 Caleb \add had\add* said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath-Sepher and captures it \add can marry\add* my daughter Aksah.”
\v 13 Otniel (son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz) captured it so \add Caleb\add* gave his daughter Aksah to him to become his wife.
\v 14 \add After the wedding\add*, she urged \add Otniel\add* to ask her father for a field. When she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, “What can I do for you?”
\v 15 “Give me a blessing,” she \add requested\add*. “Although you’ve given me land in the southern wilderness, give me some springs of water as well.” So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.
\s1 The victory of descendants of Yehudah and Benyamin
\p
\v 16 The Kenites (descendants of Mosheh’s father-in-law), left the city of palm trees \add (Yericho)\add* and went with Yehudah’s descendants to the southern wilderness near Arad and lived with the people \add there\add*.
\v 17 Then the warriors of Yehudah and Simeon conquered the Canaanites living at Tsefat and destroyed \add the city\add*. \add Now\add* it’s called Hormah \add (which means ‘complete destruction’)\add*.
\v 18 \add They\add* also captured Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron and \add all\add* their surrounding territories.
\v 19 Yahweh helped Yehudah and \add they\add* took possession of the hill country, although they weren’t able to conquer the people living down in the plains because they had iron on their chariots.
\v 20 They gave Hebron to Caleb just as Mosheh had directed, and he dispossessed the three sons of the Anak from there.\x + \xo 1:20: \xt Josh 15:13-14.\x*
\v 21 \add However\add* Benyamin’s descendants didn’t drive the Yebusites living in Yerushalem out, so \add they\add* have lived among the Benyamites in Yerushalem to this day.\x + \xo 1:21: \xt Josh 15:63; 2Sam 5:6; 1Ch 11:4.\x*
\s1 Efraim and Manashsheh conquer Beyt-El
\p
\v 22 Also Yosef’s descendants attacked Beyt-El, and Yahweh \add helped\add* them.
\v 23 \add They\add* sent spies out to Beyt-El (previously called Luz)
\v 24 and \add they\add* saw a man coming out of the city and told him, “Please show us an entrance into the city, and we’ll be kind to you.”
\v 25 \add So\add* he showed them an entrance, and \add their warriors\add* \add attacked and\add* \add killed the inhabitants\add*, but they let the man and his family go free.
\v 26 The man went to the land of the Hittites and \add founded\add* a city and called it Luz (which it’s still called to this day).
\s1 The locals not driven out by the Israelis
\p
\v 27 \add However\add* Manashsheh’s \add descendants\add* didn’t drive out those living in Beyt-Shan, Taanak, Dor, Yibleam, or Meggidon, because the Canaanites were determined \add to keep living there\add*.\x + \xo 1:27-28: \xt Josh 17:11-13.\x*
\v 28 (\add Later,\add* the Israelis became stronger and \add they forced the Canaanites to work for them as their slaves\add*, but they didn’t drive them out.)
\v 29 Nor did Efraim’s \add descendants\add* drive the Canaanites out of Gezer, so \add they\add* continued to live among them.\x + \xo 1:29: \xt Josh 16:10.\x*
\p
\v 30 Zebulun’s \add descendants\add* didn’t drive the Canaanites out of Kitron or Nahalol, so they continued to live among them and were \add forced to work as slaves\add*.
\p
\v 31 Asher’s \add descendants\add* didn’t drive out those who were living in Akko, Tsidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Afek, or Rehob,
\v 32 \add So\add* the Asherites lived with the Canaanites who \add still\add* lived in the region because they didn’t drive them out.
\p
\v 33 Naftali’s \add descendants\add* didn’t drive out those who were living in Beyt-Shemesh or Beyt-Anat, so they continued to live among them and were \add forced to work as slaves\add*.
\p
\v 34 The Amorites forced Dan’s descendants to live in the hill country, because they didn’t allow them to come down to the plains.
\v 35 The Amorites were determined to live at Mt. Heres, in Ayyalon and Shaalbim (but when Yosef’s descendants became stronger, they forced the Amorites \add to work as slaves\add*).
\v 36 The Amorites border went from the Scorpion Pass through Sela and upward from there.
\c 2
\s1 God’s messenger comes to Bokim
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh’s messenger went from Gilgal to Bokim and told \add the Israelis\add*, “I brought you all out of Egypt and led you here to this land that I promised to your ancestors. I had said that I wouldn’t ever break my agreement with you all,
\v 2 but that you mustn’t form treaties with the peoples who lived here, rather you must tear down their altars. But you all haven’t obeyed what I said. What have you \add gone and\add* done?\x + \xo 2:2: \xt Exo 34:12-13; Deu 7:2-5.\x*
\v 3 \add So\add* I’m telling you that I won’t drive your enemies out ahead of you, \add but\add* they’ll be like thorns in your sides and you’ll all end up being enslaved to their \add idols\add*.”
\v 4 When Yahweh’s messenger finished saying that, the people wept loudly,
\v 5 so they called that place Bokim \add (which means ‘weeping’)\add* and they \add offered sacrifices\add* to Yahweh there.
\s1 The death of Yehoshua
\p
\v 6 Then Yehoshua dismissed the people and the \add tribes went to their various regions\add* to take possession of the land.
\v 7 The people \add obeyed\add* Yahweh \add as long as Yehoshua and the elders who had seen the great things that Yahweh had done for Israel, were alive\add*.
\v 8 Then Yahweh’s servant Yehoshua (son of Nun) died at the age of 110
\v 9 and they buried him in his allocated land at Timnat-Heres, inside Efraim’s hill country territory north of Mt. Gaash.\x + \xo 2:9: \xt Josh 19:49-50.\x*
\s1 Israel turns from Yahweh
\p
\v 10 When all of that generation \add had passed away\add*, the next generation didn’t know Yahweh or \add even\add* know about what he’d done for \add the Israelis\add*.
\v 11 \add They\add* did \add things that Yahweh considered evil\add* and worshipped Baal \add idols\add*
\v 12 and abandoned the god of their ancestors, Yahweh, the one who brought them out of Egypt. \add Instead\add* they went after other gods—the gods of the people around them. They worshipped them and that made Yahweh angry.
\v 13 They abandoned Yahweh and \add worshipped\add* the Baal and Ashtarot \add idols\add*.
\v 14 \add So\add* Yahweh \add got angry with\add* Israel so \add he caused raiders to come and take their property\add* and \add he allowed their enemies to become more powerful\add* so they could no longer stand against them.
\v 15 \add Whenever the Israelis went into battle\add*, Yahweh \add worked against them\add* just like \add he’d\add* said he would and they became very distressed.
\p
\v 16 Then Yahweh \add gave them\add* leaders\f + \fr 2:16 \ft Traditionally called ‘judges’ in most English translations, but that modern term doesn’t fit their various functions in this account at all well. (‘Leaders’ isn’t perfect either but it’s generic enough to cover most of their roles.)\f* to save them from the raiders.
\v 17 \add However\add* they wouldn’t listen to \add those\add* leaders \add either\add*—continuing to prostitute themselves to other gods and bowing down to idols. They rapidly turned away from their ancestors’ ways and \add showed no interest\add* in obeying Yahweh’s instructions.
\v 18 Whenever Yahweh \add gave them\add* a leader, he would \add support\add* that leader and would save them from their enemies during that leader’s life, because he pitied \add the people\add* when they groaned \add from being tormented and oppressed\add*.
\v 19 \add But then at the death of that leader\add*, they would turn back and behave more corruptly than their ancestors—following other gods and bowing down to \add idols\add*. They didn’t stop any of their evil activities or their shameless behaviour
\v 20 \add so\add* Yahweh \add was very angry\add* at Israel and said, “This nation has broken the agreement that I made with their ancestors and haven’t \add done what I told them to\add*.
\v 21 I won’t keep driving the people groups away that \add remained\add* when Yehoshua died,
\v 22 so as to use them to test Israel \add to see\add* whether \add the Israelis\add* will obey my instructions like their ancestors did, or not.
\v 23 \add So\add* Yahweh allowed those people groups to stay on, and hence they hadn’t been \add handed over\add* to Yehoshua.
\c 3
\s1 The remaining kingdoms in Canaan
\p
\v 1 The \add following\add* are the kingdoms which Yahweh allowed to remain so as to test the \add newer generations\add* of Israel who hadn’t experienced the battles in Canaan
\v 2 (\add if\add* only for the sake of teaching warfare to those generations who hadn’t experienced it):
\v 3 the five Philistine rulers and the Canaanites, the Sidonians, the Hivites that live on Mt. Lebanon between Mt. Baal-Hermon and Lebo-Hamat.\f + \fr 3:3 \ft Or, ‘the entrance to Hamat’.\f*
\v 4 They were \add left\add* to test Israel to find out if they would obey Yahweh’s instructions that had been given through Mosheh to their ancestors,
\v 5 and \add so\add* the Israelis lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Yebusites.
\v 6 They took their daughters as wives, and gave their own daughters \add to be married\add* to their sons, and they \add worshipped\add* their gods.
\s1 Otniel
\p
\v 7 \add So\add* the \add Israelis did things considered evil by\add* Yahweh and they forgot about their god Yahweh, \add instead\add* serving the Baal and Asherot \add idols\add*.
\v 8 \add Because of that,\add* Yahweh \add was very angry\add* with Israel, so he \add handed them over to\add* King Cushan-Rishathaim of Aram-Naharaim \add (Mesopotamia)\add*. The Israelis served him for eight years
\v 9 \add but when\add* they cried out to Yahweh, \add he\add* \add sent them\add* a \add leader to rescue\add* them: Otniel, son of Caleb’s younger brother Kenaz.
\v 10 Yahweh’s spirit \add empowered\add* him and he led Israel. He \add led them into battle\add* against King Cushan-Rishathaim of Aram, and Yahweh \add helped them\add* defeat \add him\add*.
\v 11 \add So\add* the region had peace for forty years, and then Otniel (Kenaz’s son) died.
\s1 Ehud
\p
\v 12 \add Once\add* again the Israelis started doing things considered evil by Yahweh, \add so\add* because of that, \add he\add* strengthened King Eglon of Moab against Israel.
\v 13 \add King Eglon\add* \add enlisted warriors from\add* the Ammonites and the Amalekites, and they attacked Israel and captured \add Yericho,\add* the city of palm trees,
\v 14 \add so\add* the Israelis served \add him\add* for eighteen years.
\p
\v 15 \add But\add* the Israelis cried out to Yahweh, \add he\add* \add sent them\add* a \add leader to rescue\add* them: the left-hander Ehud, son of Gera the Benyamite. The Israelis sent him to carry the tribute payment to King Eglon of Moab.
\v 16 \add Now\add* Ehud had made himself a double-edged sword—a short one about half a metre long—and he strapped it to his right thigh beneath his clothes.
\v 17 Then he presented the tribute to King Eglon of Moab, who was a very fat man,
\v 18 and after leaving \add for home\add*, he sent off the people who’d \add actually\add* carried it \add all\add*.
\v 19 Then from the stone quarries \add that they’d reached\add* near Gilgal, he returned and told the king that he had a private message for him. The king told his attendants to be quiet then sent them out of the room.
\p
\v 20 \add So\add* Ehud approached where the king was sitting alone in the coolness of his upper room and told him, “I have a message for you from God.” \add The king\add* stood up from \add his\add* seat
\v 21 and then Ehud reached with his left hand and pulled the sword from his right thigh and plunged it into \add the king’s\add* belly.
\v 22 Even the handle went in after the blade and the fat closed up over the handle because \add Ehud\add* didn’t pull the sword out of his belly. Then he went out to the passage\f + \fr 3:22 \ft The meaning of the last word in the Hebrew here is uncertain, so other translations might differ.\f*
\v 23 and closed and locked the rooms of the upper room and exited through the porch.\f + \fr 3:23 \ft Again, the Hebrew meaning of the last word here is uncertain, so other translations might differ.\f*
\v 24 After he’d left, the servants came and found the doors locked, so they thought \add the king\add* must be relieving himself in \add there\add*.
\v 25 They waited until they \add became worried\add* that he hadn’t opened the doors, \add so\add* they got a key and opened \add them\add*, only to find their master lying dead on the floor.
\p
\v 26 While \add the servants\add* had been waiting, Ehud had escaped and passed beyond the quarries, then fleeing to Seirah.
\v 27 When he got there, he blew a trumpet \add throughout\add* the Efraimite hill country, and \add so\add* the \add Israelis assembled under his direction\add* down \add in the valley\add*.
\v 28 “Follow after me,” he told them, “because Yahweh \add will enable you all to defeat your enemies, the Moabites\add*.” So they followed him down to the Yordan \add river\add* and captured the fords opposite Moab, thus preventing anyone from crossing.
\v 29 Then they \add attacked Moab and killed around ten thousand men\add*—all strong and capable yet none of them escaped.
\v 30 \add So\add* Moab was subdued that day by the Israelis, and \add there was peace in the region\add* for eighty years.
\s1 Shamgar
\p
\v 31 After \add Ehud\add* came Shamgar (Anat’s son), and he rescued Israel by killing six hundred Philistines with a cattle prod.
\c 4
\s1 Deborah and Barak
\p
\v 1 After Ehud died, the Israelis again started doing things \add considered evil by\add* Yahweh,
\v 2 \add so\add* \add he\add* handed them over to King Yabin of Canaan who reigned in Hatsor. Sisera was the commander of his army, and he lived in Haroshet-Haggoyim.
\v 3 The Israelis cried out to Yahweh because \add Sisera\add* had nine hundred chariots with iron on them, and he cruelly oppressed \add them\add* for twenty years.
\p
\v 4 \add Now\add* the prophetess Deborah (Lappidot’s wife) was leading Israel at that time.
\v 5 She \add would sit\add* under the palm tree between Ramah and Beyt-El (in the Efraimite hill country), and \add people\add* would come to her \add to have their disputes settled\add*.
\v 6 \add One day\add* she summoned Barak (Abinoam’s son from Kedesh in Naftali) and told him, “Israel’s God, Yahweh commands you to draft ten thousand men from Naftali and Zebulun and \add assemble\add* at Mt. Tabor.
\v 7 Yahweh will lure King Yabin’s army commander, Sisera bring his warriors and chariots to the Kishon river, and \add Yahweh will enable you to defeat them there\add*.”
\p
\v 8 “I’ll go if you’ll come with me,” \add replied\add* Barak, “\add but\add* if you won’t come with me, I won’t go.”
\p
\v 9 “I’ll certainly go with you,” she said, “but it won’t be you that’s honoured \add afterwards\add*, but \add rather\add* Yahweh \add will use a woman to defeat\add* Sisera.” So Deborah \add accompanied\add* Barak to Kedesh.
\v 10 \add There\add* \add he\add* summoned \add warriors from\add* Zebulun and Naftali and ten thousand men came, and \add they all went together\add* with Deborah \add to Mt. Tabor\add*.
\p
\v 11 \add Now\add* Heber had moved \add with his wife Yael and their family\add* \add away from the other\add* Kenites (and from Mosheh’s father-in-law Hobab’s descendants) and set up his tent by the oak tree at Zaanannim near Kedesh.
\p
\v 12 \add When\add* Sisera was told that Barak (Abinoam’s son) had gone to Mt. Tabor,
\v 13 \add he\add* assembled his warriors and their nine hundred chariots (with iron on them) \add and went from\add* Haroshet-Haggoyim to the Kishon riverbed.
\p
\v 14 “Get going,” Deborah told Barak, “because it’s today that Yahweh has gone ahead of you and \add will help you defeat\add* Sisera.” So Barak led his ten thousand warriors down from Mt. Tabor.
\v 15 Then Yahweh \add caused Sisera and all his warriors and chariots to be confused as Barak advanced\add*, \add so\add* Sisera jumped down from his chariot and took off on foot.
\v 16 Barak pursued the men and chariots as far as Haroshet-Haggoyim and they killed them all—not a single one survived.
\p
\v 17 \add But\add* Sisera had fled on foot \add and ran to\add* Yael’s tent (Heber the Kenite’s wife) because there was peace between King Yabin of Hatsor and the house of Heber the Kenite.
\v 18 Yael went out to meet Sisera and told him, “\add Stop and rest\add*, my master. \add Stop and rest here\add*. Don’t be afraid.” So he turned and went into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.
\p
\v 19 “I’m thirsty,” he said. “Could you get me a little water to drink.” \add Yael\add* opened a goatskin container and gave him milk to drink, then she covered him \add again\add*.
\v 20 “Stand at the tent doorway,” he said, “and if anyone comes and asks you if \add you’ve seen a man\add*, say, ‘No.’ ”
\p
\v 21 Then Heber’s wife Yael got a hammer and a tent peg and \add crept in silently\add*, driving the peg through his temple and pounding it into the ground,. He’d been tired and was sleeping soundly, and \add it killed him\add*.
\v 22 \add Meanwhile\add* Barak \add had been searching for\add* Sisera, and Yael went out to meet him. “Come in here,” she told him, “and I’ll show you the man you’ve been searching for.” He \add followed her into the tent\add* and wow—Sisera was lying there dead with the peg \add still\add* through his temple.
\p
\v 23 \add So\add* that day God defeated Canaanite King Yabin’s \add army\add* \add in front of the Israelis\add*,
\v 24 and as \add they\add* became stronger against \add him\add*, they destroyed King Yabin of Canaan.
\c 5
\s1 Deborah and Barak sing together
\p
\v 1 That day, Deborah and Barak sang this song:
\q1
\v 2 “When the leaders take the lead in Israel,
\q1 when the people offer themselves willingly,
\q1 Yahweh be blessed.
\q1
\v 3 Listen you kings.
\q1 Pay attention you rulers.
\q1 I will sing to Yahweh, yes, even me.
\q1 I will make music for Israel’s God Yahweh.
\q1
\v 4 Yahweh, you left Seir.
\q1 You marched out of the Edom region.
\q2 The earth quaked.
\q2 The heavens also dropped.
\q1 And the clouds poured down rain.
\q1
\v 5 Mountains melted in Yahweh’s presence,\x + \xo 5:5: \xt Exo 19:18.\x*
\q1 Yes, Mt. Sinai shook in front of Israel’s God, Yahweh.
\b
\q1
\v 6 In the days of Anat’s son Shamgar,
\q1 in the days of Yael,
\q1 \add main\add* roads were abandoned,
\q1 and travellers walked twisting trails.
\q1
\v 7 Israeli villages were abandoned.
\q1 No one lived there until I, Deborah, became their leader.
\q1 I became one of Israel’s mothers.
\q1
\v 8 When \add Israel\add* chose new gods,
\q2 then enemies attacked the city gates.
\q1 No shield or spear could be found
\q2 among forty thousand in Israel.
\q1
\v 9 \add I’m thankful\add* to Israel’s commanders
\q2 who volunteered \add to help\add* the people.
\q1 Yahweh be blessed.
\q1
\v 10 You riders of white donkeys,
\q1 you who sit on saddle blankets,
\q1 you who’re walking on the road,
\q2 tell about \add this\add*.
\b
\q1
\v 11 From the sounds of conflict over the watering places
\q2 they recount ≈Yahweh’s righteousness
\q2 and about his righteous warriors in Israel.
\b
\q1 Then Yahweh’s people went down to the \add city\add* gates.
\b
\q1
\v 12 Wake up, Deborah, wake up.
\q1 Wake up, wake up, \add sing\add* a song.
\q1 Barak, \add get moving\add* and capture your prisoners,
\q2 you son of Abinoam.
\q1
\v 13 Then the survivor went down to the nobles.
\q1 Yahweh’s people went down to the mighty. ???
\q1
\v 14 From Efraim their root was with Amalek.
\q1 After you, Benyamin, among your people.
\q1 From \add (Manashsheh’s)\add* Makir, the commanders came down.
\q1 And from Zebulun, those who march carrying an officer’s staff.
\q1
\v 15 My princes in Yissashkar were with Deborah.
\q1 And Yissashkar was also with Barak.
\q1 He was sent into a valley on his heels.
\q1 There was intense heart searching among the clans of Reuben.
\q1
\v 16 Why did you sit between the sheep pens?
\q1 To hear the whistling for the flocks?
\q1 There was intense heart searching among the clans of Reuben.
\q1
\v 17 Gilead settled \add east of\add* the Yordan.
\q1 \add But\add*, Dan, why does he stay on ships?
\q1 Asher stayed at the sea coast
\q1 and lives by his \add jetties\add*.
\q1
\v 18 Zebulun were a \add tribe\add* that \add devotedly\add* risked losing their lives.
\q1 And Naftali \add was at their heights\add* on the battlefield.
\b
\q1
\v 19 Kings came and made war.
\q1 Then the Canaanite kings fought at Taanak,
\q2 at the Megiddo springs.
\q1 \add But\add* they \add weren’t able to plunder any\add* silver.
\q1
\v 20 From the sky, the stars battled.
\q1 From their courses, they fought against Sisera.
\q1
\v 21 The Kishon river swept them away.
\q1 An ancient river that Kison river.
\q1 March on with strength, my soul.
\q1
\v 22 Then the horses’ hooves struck.
\q1 His galloping stallions charging.
\b
\q1
\v 23 ‘Curse \add that\add* Meroz \add place\add*,’ said Yahweh’s messenger.
\q1 ‘You shall certainly curse its inhabitants
\q1 because they didn’t come and help Yahweh—
\q1 to help Yahweh against the mighty ones.’
\b
\q1
\v 24 Yael will be an \add honoured\add* woman.
\q2 The wife of Heber the Kenite.
\q1 She deserves the most praise out of \add all\add* women \add who live in tents\add*.
\q1
\v 25 He asked for water—she gave him milk,
\q2 Yogurt in a bowl suitable for nobles.
\q1
\v 26 Her hands reached out for the tent peg,
\q2 and her right hand for the workman’s hammer.
\q1 She hammered Sisera—shattering his head—

\v 27 He bowed down between her feet—he fell—he lay down.
\q1 He bowed down between her feet—where he bowed down, there he fell—destroyed.

\q1
\v 28 Sisera’s mother looked out the window.
\q1 She peered through the lattice, crying out,
\q2 ‘Why is his chariot so slow to return?
\q2 Why are the hoofbeats of his chariots delayed?’
\q1
\v 29 Her wise ladies answered her.
\q1 Indeed, she keeps telling herself
\q1
\v 30 ‘Won’t they be gathering and dividing the plunder?
\q1 A woman or two for each warrior \add to bear children\add*.
\q1 Finding some colourful material for Sisera.

\q1
\v 31 May all your enemies perish like that, Yahweh.

\m Then that region had peace for forty years.

\s1 Gideon
\p
\v 1 The Israelis did \add things that Yahweh considered evil so\add* \add he\add* handed them over to the Midian for seven years
\v 2 and the \add Midianites oppressed\add* \add them\add* badly. \add It was so bad that the Israelis\add* made dens for themselves up in the hills, in caves, and \add in small, fortified settlements\add*.
\v 3 Whenever the Israelis planted a crop, the Midianites or the Amalekites, or eastern groups would attack \add them\add*.
\v 4 They would set up their camps around them and destroy the crops as far away as Gaza—they left \add nothing for the Israelis to eat\add*, and \add no\add* \add sheep, cattle, or donkeys\add*.
\v 5 It was like a swarm of locusts when they’d \add all\add* come with their tents and their livestock—you couldn’t even count their camels! They entered the region to \add totally ravage\add* it.
\v 6 Thus Israel was \add severely weakened\add* by Midian, and the Israelis cried out to Yahweh.
\p
\v 7 When the Israelis cried out to Yahweh concerning Midian,
\v 8 Yahweh sent a prophet to \add them\add* and he told them, “Israel’s God Yahweh says, ‘I myself brought you all out of slavery in Egypt—
\v 9 rescuing you from the Egyptians who were oppressing you all. I drove them out \add when you all entered\add* and I’ve certainly given their land to you.
\v 10 I told you all that I’m your God Yahweh and that when you live in the Amorite regions, you all mustn’t worship their gods. But you \add didn’t listen to what I said\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 11 \add One day\add* Yahweh’s messenger came and sat beneath the oak tree in \add the town of\add* Ofrah. (The tree belonged to the Abi-Ezrite, Yoash.) Yoah’s son Gideon was beating wheat \add down\add* in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites
\v 12 when Yahweh’s messenger appeared to him and said, “Yahweh is with you, you powerful warrior.”
\p
\v 13 “With me, my master?” Gideon \add asked\add*. “If Yahweh is with us, then why’s all of this happened to us? Where are all of the miracles that our ancestors told us about, saying, ‘Didn’t Yahweh bring us up out of Egypt?’ But now Yahweh has abandoned us and handed us over to the Midianites.”
\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh turned to him and said, “Use your strength to set Israel free from the grasp of Midian. Haven’t I sent you \add to do that\add*?”
\p
\v 15 “Please, my master,” Gideon replied, “how could \em I\em* save Israel? Look, my clan is the weakest in Manashsheh and \add on top of that\add*, I’m the youngest in my \add family\add*.”
\p
\v 16 “I’ll \add help\add* you,” said Yahweh, “and you’ll strike down all the Midianites as \add easily as battling just\add* one man.”
\p
\v 17 “If indeed I’ve found favour in your eyes,” Gideon \add requested\add*, “then \add show me a miracle so I’ll know that it’s God\add* speaking to me.
\v 18 Please \add wait here\add* \add while I go and prepare\add* my gift for you and bring it back here for you.”
\p “\add Okay,\add* I’ll stay \add here\add* until you get back,” he said.
\p
\v 19 Then Gideon went a prepared a young goat and unrisen bread. He put the meat in a basket and the soup in a pot and brought them out to the oak tree and offered them to him.
\v 20 Then God’s messenger said, “Take the meat and the flat bread and put them on this rock, then pour the soup out \add over it\add*.” \add So\add* \add Gideon\add* did that
\v 21 and Yahweh’s messenger stretched out the staff that he was holding and touched the meat and bread with the end of it. A fire flamed up from the rock and burnt up the meat and bread, then Yahweh’s messenger went out of his sight.\f + \fr 6:21 \ft It’s unclear from the text, whether he just got up and walked away, or if he vanished in a more miraculous fashion.\f*
\p
\v 22 When Gideon \add realised\add* that it \add really\add* had been Yahweh’s messenger, he \add was upset and said\add*, “Oh no, my master Yahweh, \add what will happen now that\add* I’ve seen Yahweh’s face to face?”
\v 23 But Yahweh \add replied\add* to him, “Peace to you. Don’t be afraid—you won’t die.”
\v 24 \add So\add* Gideon built an altar there to \add sacrifice\add* to Yahweh and named it ‘Yahweh is peace’. (It’s still stands there at Ofrah of the Abi-Ezrite to this day.)
\p
\v 25 \add That same\add* night, Yahweh told him, “Take the young bull that belongs to your father, and the second bull seven years old. Break the altar of Baal into pieces that belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah pole that’s beside it.
\v 26 Build a \add regular\add* altar to your God Yahweh on top of this stronghold, then take the second bull and offer a whole burnt offering using the Asherah pole that you cut down \add for firewood\add*.”
\v 27 \add So\add* Gideon took ten of his servants and did what Yahweh had instructed him to, \add but\add* he did it at night because he was afraid to do it in the daytime—\add fearing the anger of\add* his father’s household and the men of the city.
\p
\v 28 When the men of the city got up early the next morning, wow, the Baal’s altar had been torn down, the Asherah pole that was beside it had been cut down, and the second bull had been offered on a \add new\add* altar that had been built.
\v 29 \add So\add* people started asking each other, “Who did this?” After some investigation, they said, “Yoash’s son Gideon did it.”
\v 30 Then the men of the city told Yoash, “Bring your son out \add here\add* \add to be executed\add*, because he tore down the Baal’s altar and cut down the Asherah \add pole\add* that was beside it.”
\p
\v 31 “\add Are you all really fighting Baal’s battle for him\add*?” Yoash replied to those standing against him. “Are you all really helping him? Whoever fights on his behalf should be be put to death while it is still the morning. If \add Baal\add* is a god, then let him stand up for himself when someone tears down his altar.”
\v 32 \add So after that\add*, he called \add Gideon\add* ‘Yerub-Baal’ to say ‘Let Baal defend himself,’ because he had torn down \add Baal’s\add* altar.
\p
\v 33 \add Meanwhile\add* all the Midianite and Amalekite \add warriors\add* and others from the east, assembled together. Then they crossed the Yordan and set up camp in the Jezreel valley.
\v 34 \add But\add* Yahweh’s spirit \add enabled\add* Gideon, and he blew a trumpet and called the \add men of\add* Abiezer to follow him.
\v 35 Then he sent messengers throughout all of \add the regions of\add* Manashsheh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naftali, and summoned \add their warriors\add* to come and join with them.
\p
\v 36 Then Gideon said to God, “If it’s \add really\add* you rescuing Israel \add through me\add* like you said,
\v 37 I’ll put this woollen fleece on the threshing floor \add tonight\add*. If there’s dew on the fleece in the morning, but it’s dry around it, then I’ll know that you’ll rescue Israel \add through me\add* just as you said.”
\v 38 And that’s what happened—he rose early the next morning and squeezed the fleece and wrung out a bowl full of water from the dew.
\v 39 Then Gideon said to God, “Don’t \add be angry with me\add*, but \add can I ask one more thing\add*. Let me put the fleece out this time, and let the fleece be dry, but wet all around it with dew.”
\v 40 \add So\add* God did it that night, and \add the next morning\add* only the fleece was dry, but everywhere around was covered with dew.
\c 7
\s1 Gideon defeats the Midianites
\p
\v 1 Then Gideon (\add also known as\add* Yerub-Baal) and the warriors with him got up early and \add went to\add* Harod spring. The Midianite camp was north of them in the valley below the Moreh hill.
\p
\v 2 Then Yahweh told Gideon, “\add You’ve got too many warriors with you for me to give victory over the Midianites, because what if Israel takes the glory for themselves thinking that their own strength saved them\add*.
\v 3 \add So\add* tell the men that anyone who’s afraid or trembling can leave Mt. Gilead and go back home.” Twenty-two thousand of them went back, leaving \add only\add* ten thousand.\x + \xo 7:3: \xt Deu 20:8.\x*
\p
\v 4 “That’s still too many,” Yahweh told Gideon. “Bring them down to the \add spring\add* and I’ll short-list them there. Whoever I tell you to go with you, can do so, but anyone that I say won’t go with you, won’t go.”
\v 5 \add So\add* he took them down to the water and Yahweh told \add him\add*, “\add Separate out those\add* who lap up the water with \add their tongues\add* like a dog would, \add along with those\add* who kneel down to drink.”
\v 6 \add It turned out\add* that \add only\add* three hundred men used their hands to bring water to their mouths, and all the rest knelt down to drink the water.
\v 7 “I’ll \add rescue\add* you all from Midian with the three hundred men who lapped the water \add from their hands\add*,” Yahweh told Gideon. “Let all the others go back to their homes.”
\v 8 Then the three-hundred warriors \add collected\add* the food and ram’s horns from the others before \add Gideon\add* sent the others back to their own \add homes\add*.
\p The Midian camp was below \add them\add* \add down\add* in the valley
\v 9 and during the night Yahweh told \add Gideon\add*, “\add Get ready\add* and \add lead them\add* down into the camp, because I have \add made you victorious\add*.
\v 10 \add But\add* if you’re afraid to \add attack\add*, take your servant Purah down to \add their\add* camp
\v 11 and you’ll hear what they’re saying, then \add you’ll have the courage to go down\add* \add and attack\add* the camp.” So \add Gideon\add* and his servant Purah went \add quietly\add* down to the \add unit\add* at the edge of the camp.
\p
\v 12 The Midianites and Amalekites and others from the east covered the valley like a swarm of locusts. \add Even\add* their camels were as numerous as sand grains on the beach.
\v 13 \add When\add* Gideon \add got close\add*, a man was telling his companion about his dream. “Listen,” he said, “I had a dream and wow, a round loaf of barley bread was tumbling into \add our\add* camp. It came as far as the tent and struck it so that it fell and turned it upside down, and collapsed \add completely\add*.”
\p
\v 14 “\add That could only be\add* the sword of Yoash’s son Gideon from Israel,” \add the other man\add* replied. “The true God has \add caused Midian and all of the camp to be defeated by him\add*.”
\p
\v 15 When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he \add thanked God\add*, then \add they\add* returned to \add their\add* camp and \add commanded\add*, “\add Get ready to go\add* because Yahweh has given \add you all victory over\add* the Midianite camp.”
\v 16 Then he divided the three hundred men into three units, and gave each of them rams’ horns and \add clay\add* jars with \add burning\add* torches inside them,
\v 17 and instructed them, “Watch me and do what I do. See, when I get to the edge of \add their\add* camp, do the same as me.
\v 18 When I blow the ram’s horn trumpet, all of you with horns should blow them and \add everyone\add* will shout, ‘For Yahweh and for Gideon!’ ”
\p
\v 19 \add When\add* Gideon and the hundred men with him got to the edge of the camp, it was the beginning of the middle nightwatch and \add the fresh guards had just gotten into their places\add*. \add Gideon and his unit\add* blew their trumpets and smashed the jars \add that they were carrying\add*.
\v 20 Then \add all\add* three units blew the trumpets and smashed their jars. They held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands, and they shouted out, “A sword for Yahweh and for Gideon.”
\v 21 Then everyone stood in their place around the camp, \add but\add* the \add Midianite\add* army cried out \add in alarm\add* and \add took off\add*.
\v 22 When the three hundred ram’s horns \add sounded\add*, Yahweh \add caused the Midianite army to start fighting each other with their swords\add*, and the army fled as far as Beyt-Shittah (towards Tsererah) and towards the border of Abel-Meholah (towards Tabbat).
\p
\v 23 Then the \add warriors\add* from Naftali, Asher, and from all of Manashsheh were summoned \add to help with pursuing the Midianites\add*.
\v 24 Gideon \add also\add* sent messengers through Efraim’s hill country \add to tell them\add*, “Go down \add to the Yordan river\add* opposite Midian and \add take control of the crossings to capture them between\add* as far as Beyt-Barah.” So all the men of Efraim were summoned and they commandeered the Yordan \add crossings\add* as far as Beyt-Barah.
\v 25 They chased after the Midianites and captured their two princes, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock \add now called\add* ‘Oreb’s rock’, and they killed Zeeb at a winepress \add now called\add* ‘Zeeb’s winepress’, and they brought their heads back across the Yordan to Gideon.
\c 8
\s1 The final defeat of the Midianites
\p
\v 1 \add But\add* then the Efraimite men \add challenged\add* Gideon, “Why have you \add side-tracked\add* us? Why didn’t you call us when you went to battle against the Midianites?” And they severely rebuked him.
\p
\v 2 “What \add have I achieved compared to you guys\add*?” \add answered\add* \add Gideon\add*. “Aren’t the \add seconds\add* of Efraim’s grapes better than the \add whole\add* grape harvest of Abiezer?
\v 3 God \add helped you all defeat\add* Oreb and Zeeb, the princes of Midian. What did I do compared to that?” After he said that, they \add all\add* \add calmed down again\add*.\x + \xo 8:3-5: \xt Psa 83:11.\x*
\p
\v 4 Then Gideon and his three hundred warriors crossed the Yordan \add going east\add*. They were \add all exhausted, but continued the pursuit\add*.
\v 5 \add When they arrived at the town\add* of Sukkot, Gideon asked the \add leaders\add*, “Please give my men some bread to eat because they’re exhausted, \add but we’re chasing\add* Zebah and Zalmunna, the Midianite kings.”
\p
\v 6 \add However, the Sukkot officials asked\add* \add cautiously\add*, “\add Do you already have Zebah and Zalmunna in your grasp\add* that we should give \add food\add* to \em your\em* army?”
\p
\v 7 “Let me assure you all,” Gideon \add responded\add*, “that when Yahweh has \add helped us capture Zebah and Zalmunna\add*, I will rip off your flesh with the wilderness thorns and briers.”
\p
\v 8 From there they climbed up to Penuel, and he \add asked them for food in a similar manner\add*, and the \add leaders there\add* responded similarly to the \add leaders\add* of Sukkot.
\v 9 \add So\add* he said to the men of Penuel as well, “When I return \add safely\add*, I’ll tear down this tower.”
\p
\v 10 \add Now\add* Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with around fifteen thousand warriors—all that remained out of all of that allied Midianite camp of eastern people, because one hundred and twenty thousand of their warriors had already been killed.
\v 11 Gideon approached them \add unexpectedly\add* via the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck their camp when they were feeling secure.
\v 12 Zebah and Zalmunna fled, but \add they\add* chased after those two Midianite kings and captured them, thus defeating their entire army.
\p
\v 13 The Gideon (Yoash’s son) \add and his warriors\add* returned from battle, going through the Heres pass.
\v 14 He captured a young man from Sukkot and questioned him—writing down the names of the seventy-seven leaders and elders of Sukkot.
\v 15 Then he \add returned to\add* Sukkot and told them, “Look \add here\add* at Zebah and Zalmunna—the ones you taunted me about when you \add asked\add*, ‘\add Do you already have Zebah and Zalmunna in your grasp\add* that we should give \add food\add* to your weary men.’ ”
\v 16 He took the city elders and \add had them punished\add* with wilderness thorns and briers \add to teach them a lesson\add*,
\v 17 then \add they went to\add* Penuel and tore down the tower and executed the city \add leaders\add*.
\p
\v 18 Then \add Gideon\add* \add asked\add* Zebah and Zalmunna, “\add What were the men like\add* that you killed at Tabor?”
\p “\add They were just like you\add*,” they \add replied\add*. “\add They seemed like they could have been a king’s sons\add*.”
\p
\v 19 “They were my brothers—the sons of my mother,” he said. “As Yahweh lives, if only you had let them live, I wouldn’t have killed you.”
\v 20 Then he \add ordered\add* Yeter, his oldest son, “Go and kill them.” But Yeter didn’t pull out his sword because he was afraid—he was still a youth.
\p
\v 21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Come and kill us yourself—\add be a man and use your own strength\add*.” So Gideon \add went over\add* and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and then he took the crescent-shaped ornaments that were on their camels’ necks.
\p
\v 22 Then \add a group of\add* Israeli men said to Gideon, “\add We want you and your sons and your future descendants to\add* rule over us, because you have \add saved us from the Midianites\add*.”
\p
\v 23 \add But\add* Gideon \add answered\add*, “\add No,\add* I won’t rule over you myself, nor will my son rule over you. Yahweh will rule over you.”
\v 24 \add However\add*, \add he\add* \add continued\add*, “Let me ask you all for something: that each man give me the \add earrings\add* from his spoil.” (\add The enemies\add* had gold earrings because they were Ishmaelites.)
\p
\v 25 “We \add can certainly do that for you\add*,” they \add replied\add*. So they spread out a garment and each man threw the \add earrings\add* from his spoil onto it.
\v 26 Now the weight of the gold earrings of gold came to twenty kilograms, and then there were the crescent-shaped ornaments, the pendants, the dyed purple garments that the Midianite kings had been wearing, as well as the collars that had been around their camels’ necks.
\v 27 Then Gideon made \add the gold\add* into an idol\f + \fr 8:27 \ft We don’t really know what ‘efod’ means in this context. (It was also used to refer to priestly clothing.)\f* and placed it in his \add home\add* city of Ophrah, and the Israelis prostituted themselves to it there, and so it became like a trap for Gideon and his household.
\p
\v 28 \add So\add* Midian was \add kept under control by the Israelis\add* and they didn’t continue to \add oppress the people\add*, and there was peace in the region for forty years during Gideon’s time.
\s1 The death of Gideon
\p
\v 29 Then \add Gideon\add* (Yoash’s son, \add also known as\add* Yerub-Baal) went back and lived in his house,
\v 30 and \add he\add* fathered seventy sons because he had many wives.
\v 31 He \add also\add* had a mistress in Shekem—she also bore him a son that he named Abimelek.
\v 32 Gideon died at a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Yoash his father, at Ofrah of the \add Abiezerites\add*.
\p
\v 33 \add However\add* after Gideon had died, the \add Israelis\add* turned away again \add from Yahweh\add* and prostituted themselves to the Baals—making Baal-Berit for themselves as a god.
\v 34 \add They\add* \add forgot about\add* their God Yahweh—the one who had rescued them from the \add clutch\add* of all of their enemies all around.
\v 35 They didn’t \add show lasting loyalty\add* to Gideon’s \add family, despite\add* all the good that he’d done within Israel.
\c 9
\s1 Abimelek snatches the kingship
\p
\v 1 \add Now\add* Gideon’s son Abimelek went to Shekem to his mother’s brothers and spoke to \add those uncles\add* and to all the \add extended\add* family of his mother’s father, saying,
\v 2 “Please \add ask around\add* all the citizens of Shekem: ‘What is better for you: Gideon’s seventy sons ruling over you, or having a single man \add in charge\add*?’ Remember that I’m your flesh and bone.”
\v 3 \add So his uncles working\add* on his behalf, passed that onto all the citizens of Shekem, and \add they became convinced in\add* Abimelek, because they said, “He’s our brother.”
\v 4 Then they gave him seventy silver coins from the temple of Baal-Berith, and Abimelek \add used them to entice some rough lay-abouts to work for\add* him.
\v 5 Then \add they\add* went to his father’s house at Ofrah, and he killed his seventy \add half-\add*brothers (Gideon’s sons) there on one stone. But Gideon’s youngest son Yotam survived because he had hidden \add from them\add*.
\v 6 Then all of the \add prominent\add* citizens of Shekem and all of Beyt-Millo assembled themselves, and they went and installed Abimelek as king beside an oak tree near the standing pillar\f + \fr 9:6 \ft Likely connected with idol worship.\f* that was in Shekem.
\s1 Yotam’s tree parable
\p
\v 7 \add When\add* they told Yotam, he went and stood on the top of Mt. Gerizim and shouted out to them all \add in a loud voice\add*, “Listen to me, citizens of Shekem, so God will listen to all of you.
\v 8 Once the trees went about in order to appoint a king for themselves, \add So\add* they said to the \em olive tree\em*, ‘Reign over us.’
\v 9 \add But\add* the olive tree replied to them, ‘Have I stopped producing my \add valuable oil used to\add* honour gods and men, that I should go to sway above the \add other\add* trees?’
\v 10 \add So\add* the trees said to the \em fig tree\em*, ‘You come \add and\add* reign over us.’
\v 11 \add But\add* the fig tree \add answered\add* them, ‘Have I stopped producing my sweetness and my good fruit, that I should go to sway above the \add other\add* trees?’
\v 12 Then the trees said to the grapevine, ‘You come \add and\add* reign over us.’
\v 13 \add But\add* the vine \add replied\add*, ‘Have I stopped producing my new wine, which cheers gods and man, that I should go to sway over the \add other\add* trees?’
\v 14 Then all the trees said to the thornbush, ‘\em You\em* come \add and\add* reign over us!’
\v 15 The thornbush told the trees, ‘If you all are \add really wanted to anoint\add* me as king over you, come \add and\add* take refuge in \em my\em* shade. But if \add you all don’t\add*, may the thornbush send out fire to \add burn up\add* Lebanon’s cedar \add forests\add*.’
\p
\v 16 “\add Therefore did\add* you all act with honesty and integrity when you installed Abimelek as king? Did you all treat \add Gideon’s family\add* well, and did you all \add repay him appropriately for what he did for you all\add*?
\v 17 My father fought on your behalf, and even \add risked\add* his life out front when he \add rescued you all from the Midianites\add*,
\v 18 \add but\add* today you’ve all risen up against my father’s family and killed his sons—seventy men on one stone. Then you’ve installed Abimelek, the son of his female servant, as king over the citizens of Shekem because he’s your brother.
\v 19 \add Now\add* if you’ve all acted with honesty and integrity with towards \add Gideon and his family\add* today, be happy with Abimelek, and he’ll also be happy with all of you,
\v 20 \add but\add* if not, then fire will come out of Abimelek and destroy the citizens of Shekem and Beyt-Millo. Fire will also come out from the Shekem’s citizens and from Beyt-Millo, and it’ll destroy Abimelech.”
\v 21 Then Yotam fled away and escaped and went to Be’er and settled there away from the presence of his \add half-\add*brother Abimelek.
\p
\v 22 Abimelek ruled over Israel for three years,
\v 23 then God sent an evil spirit between \add him\add* and the citizens of Shekem, \add so\add* the citizens \add there\add* dealt treacherously with Abimelek.
\v 24 The violent treatment of \add Gideon’s\add* seventy sons \add kept getting brought up\add*, and by \add it was all blamed on\add* their brother Abimelech who had killed them, and on \add those of\add* Shekem’s citizens who \add assisted him in\add* the killing of his brothers.
\v 25 \add So\add* the Shekem citizens placed men in ambush along the tops of the hills \add to get him\add*, \add but\add* they robbed everyone who went passed them along the road, and \add so\add* it was reported to Abimelech.
\p
\v 26 Then Gaal (Ebed’s son) came along with his brothers and \add moved into\add* Shekem, and the citizens \add there\add* \add began to\add* trust \add them\add*.
\v 27 They went out into the field, and they picked grapes from their vineyards and pressed them. They celebrated harvest festivals and they went into the house of their gods, then they ate and drank, and they cursed Abimelek.
\v 28 Then Gaal (Ebed’s son) said, “Who’s Abimelek, and who’s Shekem, that we should serve him? Isn’t \add Abimelek\add* \add Gideon’s\add* son, and Zebul is his deputy? Serve the descendants of Shekem’s father Hamor, \add but\add* why should we serve \add Abimelek\add*?
\v 29 Who will \add fight with me to defeat those\add* people and depose Abimelek? Then he said to Abimelek, ‘\add Gather\add* your army and come \add and fight\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 30 When Zebul, the prince of the city, heard \add what Ga’al (Ebed’s son) had said\add*, \add he got very angry\add*
\v 31 and he sent messengers to Abimelek in secret, saying, “Listen, Ebed’s son Gaal and his brothers are coming to Shekem, and wow, they’re inciting the city against you.
\v 32 You and the people who’re with you \add should go out at night\add* and lie in ambush in the countryside.
\v 33 Then \add when the sun rises\add* in the morning, you all should set out early and spread out in an attack against the city. Keep watch, then when \add Ga’al\add* and the people with him are coming out toward you \add to fight\add*, then you \add can overpower them and\add* \add treat him however you think fit\add*.”
\p
\v 34 \add So\add* Abimelek and all the people with him \add went out in the night\add* and they set up four units in an ambush against Shekem.
\v 35 \add In the morning,\add* Ga’al (Ebed’s son) went out and he stood at the entrance of the city gate. Then Abimelek and \add his men stood up from their hiding places\add*.
\v 36 \add When\add* Ga’al saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, a group of people is coming down from the tops of the hills!”
\p “You are seeing the shadow of the hills as men,” Zebul \add responded\add*.
\p
\v 37 \add But\add* Ga’al said again, “Look, groups of people are coming down from beside the \add top of the hill\add*, and \add another group\add* is coming from the way of the ‘oak of the diviners’.”
\p
\v 38 Then Zebul said to him, “\add Well, you were the one who\add* said, ‘Who is Abimelek that we should serve him?’ Aren’t these the people who you \add were scorning\add*? Indeed now, go out and fight against \add them\add*.”
\v 39 \add So\add* Ga’al went out in front of Shekem’s citizens and fought against Abimelek.
\v 40 Abimelek pursued him, and he \add had to flee away from him\add*. Many \add of their men\add* fell fatally wounded as far as the entrance of the city gate.
\v 41 Then Abimelek settled in Arumah, \add but\add* Zebul drove Ga’al and his brothers away from living in Shekem.
\p
\v 42 Now it so happened that the next day, the people \add of Shekem\add* went out into the countryside, and \add it was reported\add* to Abimelek.
\v 43 So he took \add his men\add* and split them into three units. Then he waited in ambush in the countryside. When he saw and wow, the people were going out of the city, then he \add attacked\add* and killed them.
\v 44 Abimelek and the units that were with him had spread out and they stood at the entrance of the city gate, and two units spread out against everyone who was in the field and killed them.
\v 45 Abimelek \add spent that whole day attacking Shekem\add*. He captured the city and \add they\add* killed the people who were in it. Then he tore \add it\add* down, and scattered salt on \add the land\add*.
\p
\v 46 When all the lords of the tower of Shekem heard, they went into the citadel of the temple for El-Berit,
\v 47 \add but\add* it was reported to Abimelek that all the lords of the Shekem tower had gathered there.
\v 48 So Abimelek and all the people with him, went up to Mt. Tsalmon. \add He\add* took axes and cut a branch down from the trees, then lifted it onto his shoulder and said to the people who were with him, “\add What I just did, you all quickly do the same\add*.”
\v 49 So all the people also each cut off a branch and then \add followed\add* Abimelek. They piled them on top of the underground chamber, \add and that’s how\add* they burnt out the underground chamber. As a result, all the distinguished people in the tower of Shekem also died—about a thousand men and women.
\p
\v 50 Then Abimelek went to Tebets and set up camp around \add the city\add* and captured it.
\v 51 \add But\add* there was a strong tower in the middle of the city, so all of the men and the women and all the prominent citizens fled to it. \add Once they were all in, they barricaded it up\add* and they went up onto the tower roof.
\v 52 Then Abimelek \add and his men\add* approached the tower and fought against it, and he came in as close as the tower entrance in order to \add set fire to it\add*,
\v 53 \add but\add* a woman threw an upper millstone down onto Abimelek’s head and it crushed his skull.\x + \xo 9:53: \xt 2Sam 11:21.\x*
\v 54 Then he cried out hurriedly to the young man bearing his armour, “Draw out your sword and put me to death, \add because I don’t want it to be said afterwards that I was killed by\add* a woman.” \add So\add* his young man stabbed him so that he died.
\v 55 \add When\add* the \add Israeli warriors\add* saw that Abimelek was dead, they all returned to their own homes.
\p
\v 56 Thus God avenged the evil of Abimelek that he had done to his father \add Gideon\add* by killing his seventy brothers,
\v 57 and God \add caused all the evil done by Shekem’s men\add* to return back upon their own heads, and the curse of \add Gideon’s\add* \add youngest\add* son Yotam, came true on them.
\c 10
\s1 Tola
\p
\v 1 \add Now\add* after Abimelek, Tola (the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, \add from the tribe\add* of Yissashkar) \add came on the scene\add* to rescue Israel. He settled in Shamir, in the hill country of Efraim.
\v 2 He \add led\add* Israel for twenty-three years, then he died and was buried in Shamir.
\s1 Yair
\p
\v 3 After him, Yair the Gileadite \add led\add* Israel for twenty-two years.
\v 4 He had thirty sons that rode on thirty donkeys. There were thirty cities for them in the Gilead region which they call Yair’s villages to this day.
\v 5 Then Yair died and he was buried in Kamon.
\s1 The making again of bad of Israelis
\p
\v 6 The \add Israelis\add* continued to do \add what Yahweh considered evil\add*: they worshipped the Ba’als, the Ashtorets, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the sons of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. They forsook Yahweh and didn’t serve him.
\v 7 Yahweh \add was very angry with\add* Israel, so he \add allowed the Philistines and the Ammonites to harass them\add*.
\v 8 They shattered and oppressed the \add Israelis\add* that year, \add but it went on\add* for eighteen years for all the \add Israelis\add* who were on the opposite side of the Yordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in the Gilead.
\v 9 Then the \add Ammonites\add* also crossed over the Yordan to fight against Yehudah, against Benyamin, and against the \add half-tribe\add* of Efraim.
\p This caused incredible distress for the \add Israelis\add*
\v 10 \add so\add* \add they\add* cried out to Yahweh, “We have sinned against you, because we have abandoned our God and we have served the Ba’als.”
\p
\v 11 “Wasn’t it from the Egyptians,” Yahweh \add responded\add*, “from the Amorites, from the \add Ammonites\add*, from the Philistines,
\v 12 the Sidonians and Amalek and Maon, when they oppressed you that you cried out to me, and I \add rescued you all from them\add*?
\v 13 \add Yet\add* you’ve all abandoned me and served other gods. Therefore, I won’t not continue to rescue you.
\v 14 Go and cry out to the gods that you’ve all chosen for yourselves. They should deliver you all at the time of your distress.”
\p
\v 15 Then the \add Israelis\add* said to Yahweh, “We’ve sinned. You do to us according to all that is good in your eyes. Only please rescue us today.”
\v 16 They removed the foreign gods from among them, and they worshipped Yahweh and \add so he became concerned\add* with Israel’s suffering.
\p
\v 17 Now the \add Ammonites had assembled\add* and were camped in Gilead. So the \add Israelis\add* gathered together and they camped at Mitspah.
\v 18 Then the princes of Gilead said to \add each other\add*, “Who \add will lead us\add* to fight against the \add Ammonites\add*? He can become the leader over all of us who live in Gilead.”
\c 11
\s1 Yiftah
\p
\v 1 Now Yiftah the Gileadite was a fierce warrior, \add but\add* he was a \add prostitute’s\add* son and his father was Gilead.
\v 2 Gilead’s wife also gave birth to sons for him, and \add when\add* those sons of the wife grew up, they drove Yiftah out and told him, “You won’t \add get any inheritance from our father’s estate\add* because you’re a son of another woman.”
\v 3 So Yiftah fled from the presence of his \add half-\add*brothers and he settled in the Tob region. Unprincipled men associated around Yiftah and went around with him.
\p
\v 4 \add Some time later\add*, the \add Ammonites battled against\add* Israel.
\v 5 and \add that was when\add* the elders of Gilead went to summon Yiftah from the Tob region.
\v 6 Then \add requested\add* Yiftah, “Come and be our commander so we can fight against the \add Ammonites\add*.”
\p
\v 7 “Don’t you all hate me? Yiftah asked \add them\add*. “Didn’t you yourselves drive me out of my father’s house? \add So\add* why have you all come to me now when you have \add troubles\add*?”
\p
\v 8 “\add Well, true\add*,” the Gilead elders \add replied\add*, “\add But\add* now we’ve turned back to you. \add So join\add* with us and fight against the \add Ammonites\add*, and you’ll become commander over all of who lives in Gilead.”
\p
\v 9 “If you bring me back to fight against the \add Ammonites\add*,” Yiftah \add asked\add* \add them\add*, “and if Yahweh \add helps me defeat them\add*, \add is it correct that\add* I’ll actually become your leader?”
\p
\v 10 “Yahweh will be a witness between us,” the Gilead elders \add responded\add*, “\add that we’ll most certainly do what you just said\add*.”
\v 11 \add So\add* Yiftah went with the Gilead elders, and the people set him as commander and leader over themselves. (Yiftah had spoken all those words before Yahweh at Mitspah.)
\p
\v 12 Then Yiftah sent messengers to the \add Ammonite\add* king, demanding, “What’s happened with respect to me and to you, that you’ve come against me to fight over my land?”
\p
\v 13 The \add Ammonite\add* king \add responded\add* to Yiftah’s messengers, “Because \add the Israelis\add* seized my land \add when they came\add* out of Egypt. It went from the Arnon \add river\add* up to the Yabbok \add river\add*, and over to the Yordan \add river\add*. Now return \add the land\add* peaceably.”
\p
\v 14 Then Yiftah sent messengers back to the \add Ammonite\add* king
\v 15 to tell him, “Yiftah \add wants you to know that\add* Israel didn’t take land from Moab nor from \add you Ammonites\add*.
\v 16 However in their coming up from Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness as far as the \add Red Sea\add* until arriving at Kadesh.
\v 17 When Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, ‘Please may \add we\add* pass through your land,’ the king of Edom wouldn’t listen. \add Israel\add* likewise sent to the king of Moab, but he wasn’t willing \add either\add*, so Israel stayed at Kadesh.\x + \xo 11:17: \xt Num 20:14-21.\x*
\v 18 Then \add we\add* went through the wilderness and turned away from the land of Edom and the land of Moab, then went \add the long way\add* \add around the eastern border\add* of Moab. They camped on the other side of the Arnon \add river\add*, but they didn’t go within Moab’s borders, because the Arnon was the border of Moab.\x + \xo 11:18: \xt Num 21:4.\x*
\v 19 Israel sent messengers to the Amorite King Sihon, the king of Heshbon \add and asked\add* him, ‘Please, let us pass through your land as far as \add our\add* place.’\x + \xo 11:19-22: \xt Num 21:21-24.\x*
\v 20 But \add King\add* Sihon didn’t trust Israel passing through within his border, \add so\add* \add he\add* assembled all of his people together and they camped at Jahaz, and he battled with Israel.
\v 21 Then Israel’s God, Yahweh, handed \add King\add* Sihon and all his people over to Israel and \add we\add* defeated them. Thus Israel took possession of all of the land of the Amorites inhabiting that region—
\v 22 everything within the Amorite territory from the Arnon \add river\add* to the Yabbok, and from the wilderness as far as the Jordan.
\v 23 \add So\add* since it was Israel’s God Yahweh that expelled the Amorites out of the presence of his people Israel, \add do you actually think that you can take\add* it \add now\add*?
\v 24 Wouldn’t you take possession if your god Chemosh, allowed you to? \add So\add* \add too\add* all that our God Yahweh has dispossessed ahead of us, we’ll possess that.
\v 25 Are you really better now than Zippor’s son, King Balak of Moab? Did he dare contend with Israel or did he ever wage war against them?\x + \xo 11:25: \xt Num 22:1-6.\x*
\v 26 Israel lived in Heshbon and in its villages for three hundred years, and in Aroer and in its villages, and in all the cities that are along the banks of the Arnon—\add so\add* why didn’t you repossess \add them\add* during that time?
\v 27 I haven’t \add done anything wrong to\add* you, \add but\add* you’re doing wrong in dealing with me by fighting against me. Yahweh, the judge, will decide today between the \add Israelis\add* and the \add Ammonites\add*.”
\v 28 \add But\add* the \add Ammonite\add* king didn’t \add take any notice of Yiftah’s message\add* to him.
\p
\v 29 Then Yahweh’s spirit \add empowered\add* Yiftah, and he passed through the Gilead and Manashsheh, and through Mizpah of Gilead, and from \add there\add* he passed through the \add Ammonite region\add*,
\v 30 and \add he\add* \add made a promise\add* to Yahweh, “If you really give \add me victory over the Ammonites\add*,
\v 31 then whoever’s \add the first person\add* to come out of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the \add battle against the Ammonites\add*, that person will belong to Yahweh, and I will offer him up as a whole burnt offering.”
\v 32 \add So\add* Yiftah \add went to the Ammonite territory\add* to fight against them, and Yahweh \add enabled them to defeat them\add*.
\v 33 Then he attacked them from Aroer and as far as \add the entrance\add* to Minnith, twenty cities, and then up to Abel-Keramim, \add slaughtering a huge number\add*. \add So\add* the \add Ammonites\add* were subdued by the presence of the \add Israelis\add*.
\s1 Yiftah’s daughter
\p
\v 34 \add When\add* Yiftah got back to his house in the Mizpah area, look, his daughter was coming out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing. She was \add their\add* only child—he didn’t have any son or daughter apart from her.
\v 35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, “Oh no! My daughter! Indeed, you’ve made me bow in grief, and you’re among those who cause me pain, because I \add made a vow\add* to Yahweh and I \add can’t go back on it\add*.”
\p
\v 36 Then she said to him, “My father, you’ve \add made a vow\add* to Yahweh. Do to me \add whatever you promised\add*, after what Yahweh has done for you—total vengeance against your \add Ammonite\add* enemies.”
\v 37 \add But\add* she \add asked\add* her father, “\add Just do this one thing\add* for me: release me for two months, so I can go away \add and take some companions\add*. I’ll fall prostrate on the hills and I’ll weep \add because I’ll never have a chance to marry\add*.”
\v 38 He \add agreed\add* and then sent her away for two months. She went \add with some\add* companions, and she wept on the hills \add because she’d never be a mother\add*.
\v 39 Then at the end of the two months, she returned to her father and he carried out his vow with respect to her \add so indeed\add* she \add never had a chance to marry\add*.
\p \add After that,\add* it became a custom in Israel
\v 40 that the \add young women\add* of Israel go to commemorate the daughter of Yiftah the Gileadite for four days during the year.
\c 12
\s1 Yiftah and the Efraimites
\p
\v 1 Now the men of Efraim were summoned and they passed northward and they said to Yiftah, “Why did you pass through in order to fight against the \add Ammonites\add*, but you didn’t call us to go with you? We’re going to burn your house down over you!”
\p
\v 2 “\add I’ve been involved in very intense disputes\add*—my people against the \add Ammonites\add*,” Yiftah told them. “When I summoned you all, you didn’t \add come and\add* rescue me from \add them\add*.
\v 3 \add When\add* I could see that you weren’t coming to assist, I took my life into my own hands. I \add advanced against\add* the \add Ammonites\add*, and Yahweh gave \add me victory over\add* them. \add So\add* why then have you all come \add here\add* to fight against me today?”
\v 4 Then Yiftah assembled all of the men of Gilead and \add they battled against\add* Efraim. The men of Gilead struck Efraim because they had said, “\add You Gilead people are just\add* fugitives from Efraim—\add living here\add* in the middle of Efraim, in the middle of Manashsheh.”
\v 5 The Gileadites captured the crossing places of the Jordan along Efraim. Then when any of the survivors from Efraim would say, “May I cross over,” the men of Gilead would \add ask\add*, “Are you an Efraimite?” If he said, “No,”
\v 6 then they’d \add demand\add*, “\add Now\add* say: Shibboleth.” But if he said “Sibboleth” because he \add didn’t have time to think\add* to pronounce it correctly, they would seize him and would slaughter him at those crossing places of the Yordan. Forty-two thousand from Efraim fell at that time.
\p
\v 7 Yiftah the Gileadite \add led\add* Israel for six years, then \add he\add* died and was buried among the cities of Gilead.
\s1 Ibtsan, Elon, and Abdon
\p
\v 8 Then after him, Ibtsan of Bethlehem \add led\add* Israel.
\v 9 Now he had thirty sons. He \add gave\add* away thirty daughters to \add be married to outsiders\add*, and he brought in thirty daughters for his sons from the outside. \add Ibtsan\add* \add led\add* Israel for seven years,
\v 10 and \add when\add* \add he\add* died, he was buried in Bethlehem.
\p
\v 11 After him, Elon the Zebulunite \add led\add* Israel for ten years.
\v 12 \add When\add* \add he\add* died, he was buried in Ayyalon in the land of Zebulun.
\v 13 After him, Abdon, the son of Hillel the Piratonite \add led\add* Israel.
\v 14 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy young male donkeys. He \add led\add* Israel for eight years.
\v 15 Then Abdon (the son of Hillel the Piratonite) died, and he was buried in Piraton in the land of Efraim, in the hill country of the \add Amalekites\add*.
\c 13
\s1 Shimshon’s birth
\p
\v 1 The \add Israelis\add* continued to do \add what Yahweh considered as evil\add*, so \add he\add* \add allowed the Philistines to oppress them\add* for forty years.
\v 2 \add Now\add* there was a man named Manoah from Zorah, of the families of the Danites. His wife was barren \add so they had no children\add*.
\v 3 \add One day,\add* Yahweh’s messenger appeared to the wife and told her, “Listen, please, you are barren and \add have never\add* given birth, but you will conceive and \add have\add* a son.
\v 4 Now take care that you surely don’t drink wine or strong drink, and that you don’t eat anything \add prohibited by our rules\add*,
\v 5 because you’ll definitely become pregnant and will \add give birth to\add* a son. \add His hair must never be cut\add* because \add he’ll\add* be a Nazirite to God from \add his conception\add*. He will begin to rescue Israel from the \add oppression\add* of the Philistines.”\x + \xo 13:5: \xt Num 6:1-5.\x*
\p
\v 6 Then the woman went and explained to her husband, “A man of God came to me. \add He looked like one of God’s messengers\add*—\add extremely terrifying\add*—\add so\add* I didn’t \add like to\add* ask him \add where he’d come from\add*, and he didn’t \add tell\add* me his name.
\v 7 Then he told me, ‘You’re definitely pregnant and you’ll \add give birth to\add* a son. So now, you mustn’t drink wine or strong drink, and you mustn’t eat anything \add prohibited by our rules\add*, because the boy will be a Nazirite to God from \add conception\add* until the day of his death.’ ”
\p
\v 8 Then Manoah prayed to Yahweh, “Oh please, my master, please let the man of God that you sent \add before\add*, come \add back\add* to us again so he can instruct us about what we must do for this boy who’s going to be born.”
\v 9 The true God listened to Manoah’s \add request\add*, and God’s messenger came to the woman again when she was sitting \add out\add* in the field, \add but\add* her husband Manoah wasn’t with her,
\v 10 \add so\add* \add she\add* quickly ran and told her husband, “Look. The man has appeared \add again\add* who came to me that day.”
\v 11 \add So\add* Manoah \add followed\add* his wife, and \add when\add* he came to the man, he \add asked\add* him, “Are you the man who spoke to \add my wife\add* \add before\add*?”
\p “\add Yes,\add* \add it was me\add*,” he replied.
\p
\v 12 “Now may your words come \add true\add*,” said Manoah. “\add How should we bring up\add* the boy, and \add what will his work be\add*?”
\p
\v 13 “\add You wife must carefully follow everything I told her\add*,” Yahweh’s messenger \add replied\add*.
\v 14 “She mustn’t \add eat or drink\add* anything that comes from the grapevine. She mustn’t drink wine or strong drink, and she mustn’t eat anything \add prohibited by our rules\add*. She must do everything that I’ve instructed her.”
\p
\v 15 “Please \add stay a little longer\add*,” Manoah \add asked\add* Yahweh’s messenger, “so that we can prepare a \add meal of tender goat meat to honour\add* your presence.”
\p
\v 16 “Even if \add I stayed longer\add*, I wouldn’t eat your \add food\add*,” Yahweh’s messenger \add replied\add*. “\add But\add* if you \add wanted to\add* prepare a burnt offering for Yahweh, you may offer it.” (Because Manoah didn’t know that \add the messenger had come from\add* Yahweh.)
\v 17 “What’s your name,” Manoah \add asked\add*, “so that we can honour you when your words come \add true\add*?”
\p
\v 18 “Why are you asking about my name,” Yahweh’s messenger \add replied\add*. “\add You simply couldn’t understand\add*.”
\p
\v 19 Then Manoah got their \add young goat\add* and \add the other requirements for\add* the offering, and he \add presented\add* a sacrifice to Yahweh on the rock. Then \add an amazing thing happened\add*\f + \fr 13:19 \ft We’ve changed this to a passive construction here, because it’s not specified whether it was Yahweh himself or his messenger who did the miracle.\f* while Manoah and his wife watched—
\v 20 when the \add flames\add* went up into the sky from the altar, Yahweh’s messenger went up in the \add flames\add* while Manoah and his wife were watching. \add When they saw that,\add* they \add quickly bowed right down\add* to the ground.
\v 21 \add After that,\add* Manoah and his wife \add never saw him again\add*, \add but now\add* Manoah knew that he was Yahweh’s messenger.
\p
\v 22 Manoah said to his wife, “\add We’ll definitely die now\add* because we’ve seen God!”
\p
\v 23 But his wife replied to him, “If Yahweh had wanted to kill us, he wouldn’t have \add accepted\add* the entire burnt offering and the grain offering. He wouldn’t have shown us all those things, and he wouldn’t have \add given us those instructions\add*.”
\p
\v 24 \add In due course,\add* the woman gave birth to a son and she named him Shimshon \add (commonly misnamed as ‘Samson’ in English)\add*. The boy grew up and Yahweh blessed him,
\v 25 and then Yahweh’s spirit began to stir him \add when he was\add* in Mahaneh Dan—between Zorah and between Eshtaol.
\c 14
\s1 Shimshon and the woman from Timnah
\p
\v 1 \add One time when\add* Shimshon went to Timnah, he \add noticed\add* a young, Philistine woman \add there\add*,
\v 2 and he went \add back home\add* and he reported to his \add parents\add*, “I saw a Philistine woman in Timnah \add that I’d like you to get for me as my\add* wife.”
\p
\v 3 “Isn’t there a woman among your relatives?” his \add parents asked\add* him, “Or among all of \add our\add* people? Why take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?”
\p “Get her for me,” Shimshon said to his father, “because \add I feel she’s right for me\add*.”
\p
\v 4 \add Now his parents\add* didn’t know that Yahweh \add was arranging this\add*, because he was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines who were \add oppressing\add* Israel at that time.
\p
\v 5 Then Shimshon went to Timnah with his \add parents\add* and \add when\add* they got to the vineyards \add there\add*, wow, a young lion roared \add when it saw\add* him.
\v 6 Yahweh’s spirit \add rose up in\add* \add Shimshon\add*, and he tore \add the lion\add* to pieces \add with his bare hands\add* like butchering a young goat, \add but\add* he didn’t \add mention to his parents\add* what he’d done.
\p
\v 7 Then he \add continued on\add* and talked with the woman, and \add he really liked her\add*.
\v 8 \add Some time later when he returned for the wedding\add*, he turned off the path to look for the lion’s carcass, and \add to his surprise\add*, a swarm of bees had nested in the carcass and \add there was\add* honey \add there\add*.
\v 9 He \add filled his cupped hands with honey\add*, and \add continued\add* along—walking and eating as he went to \add where his parents were\add*. He even gave some to them \add to try\add*, but he didn’t tell them that he had scooped \add it\add* out of the carcass of a dead lion.
\v 10 Then his father went \add to visit\add* the woman, and \add in the custom of the young men\add* \add of the time\add*, Shimshon \add held\add* a party \add there\add*.
\v 11 \add When\add* they saw him, they brought thirty close friends to join him.\f + \fr 14:11 \ft Although we can understand the words here, we’re not certain of the implications, or perhaps the cultural traditions. Did Shimshon appear too alone? Too intimidating? Or was it just bringing more friends for good food and drink?\f*
\v 12 Samson said to them, “Let me suggest a riddle for you all. If you’re \add able to\add* explain it to me during the seven days of the party and \add you’ve worked it out correctly\add*, I’ll give you all thirty linen coats and thirty sets of clothes.
\v 13 But if you all can’t \add explain it\add* to me, then you yourselves must give me thirty linen coats and thirty sets of clothes.”
\p “\add Okay, we’re listening. Tell us the riddle\add*.” they \add answered\add*.
\p
\v 14 \add So\add* he said,
\q1 “Food came out of the eater,
\q1 and sweetness came out of the strong one.”
\m But three days later, they \add still couldn’t solve his\add* riddle.
\p
\v 15 Then on the seventh day,\f + \fr 14:15 \ft The Greek Septuagint translation says ‘the \em fourth\em* day’, which perhaps might fit better into the narrative, but ‘seventh’ is in the Hebrew that we have and not necessarily incorrect.\f* they \add pressured\add* Shimshon’s wife, “Get your husband \add to tell you the answer of\add* the riddle, otherwise we’ll burn \add down\add* your father’ house and you \add as well\add*. \add Did you invite us to the party just to impoverish\add* us?”
\p
\v 16 Then Shimshon’s wife \add put on a crying act\add* and said, “You must hate me—you don’t love me \add because\add* you’ve \add created\add* a riddle \add for my relatives\add*, yet you haven’t \add even told me the answer\add*.”
\p “Listen,” he \add replied\add*, “I haven’t \add even\add* \add told my own parents\add*. Should I tell you?”
\v 17 She continued to cry beside him throughout the seven-day party, and then \add finally\add* on the seventh day, he \add gave in and\add* told her because she kept nagging him, \add so in the end\add* she \add was able to reveal the answer to her relatives\add*.
\v 18 Then the men of the city said to \add Shimshon\add* before the sun went down on the seventh day,
\q1 “What is sweeter than honey?
\q1 And what’s stronger than a lion?”
\m \add So\add* he said to them,
\q1 “If you all hadn’t ploughed with my heifer,
\q1 you wouldn’t have been able to solve my riddle.”
\p
\v 19 Then Yahweh’s spirit \add rose up in\add* him, and he went to Ashkelon and killed thirty men \add there\add*. He took their possessions, and he gave the changes of clothes for the riddle. \add But he was very angry, so\add* he went \add back to his parent’s home\add*.
\v 20 Then \add (unknown to Shimshon)\add*, \add his\add* wife \add was given to the man who’d been\add* his close friend and companion.
\c 15
\p
\v 1 Some days later during the wheat harvest, Shimshon visited his wife with a young goat \add as a present for the family, because\add* he said, “I’ll go into the bedroom with my wife.” \add But\add* her father wouldn’t allow him to go in,
\v 2 and \add pleaded\add*, “Truly, I \add I thought that you must\add* hate her, so I gave her to your close friend. \add But wouldn’t\add* her younger sister be better \add anyway\add*? Please, \add would you take her instead\add*.”
\p
\v 3 Shimshon \add responded\add*, “This time I’m blameless concerning the Philistines when I \add cause trouble for\add* them.”
\v 4 Then \add he\add* went and captured three hundred foxes and \add tied them in pairs\add*—tail to tail. He took torches, and \add tied\add* one torch between \add the tails of each pair\add*.
\v 5 He \add lit\add* the torches and let \add the foxes\add* loose into the grain \add crops\add* of the Philistines. As a result, he burnt both the standing grain \add plants\add* and also the \add harvested\add* \add stacks\add* of sheaves, and even a vineyard and an olive orchard.
\v 6 \add So\add* the Philistines \add asked\add*, “Who did this?”
\p “Shimshon,” they \add replied\add*, “the son-in-law of the \add man from Timnah\add*, because he took \add Shimshon’s\add* wife and gave her to his close friend.” As a result, the Philistines went \add to Timnah\add* and they burnt \add both\add* \add the woman\add* and her father.
\v 7 Then Shimshon told them, “Since you actually did that \add horrible thing\add*, I certainly \add won’t\add* stop until I’ve avenged myself against you all.”
\v 8 Then he attacked the Philistines and \add crippled many of them, before going to\add* Etam’s rock where he lived in a cave.
\s1 Shimshon defeats the Philistines
\p
\v 9 \add However\add*, the Philistine \add warriors\add* went and camped in Yehudah, and spread out \add around the town of\add* Lehi.
\v 10 \add But\add* the men of Yehudah \add asked\add* \add them\add*, “Why have you all come \add here to attack\add* us?”
\p “We’ve come to \add capture\add* Shimshon,” they \add replied\add*. “To \add give him some of his own back\add*.”
\v 11 Then three thousand men from Yehudah went down to the cleft of Etam’s rock, and told Shimshon, “Don’t you realise that the Philistines are ruling over us? \add Why are you causing more trouble for\add* us?”
\p “Just as they’ve done to me,” he \add replied\add*, “so I’ve done to them.”
\p
\v 12 “We’ve come \add here to tie you up so we can hand\add* you over to the Philistines,” they said.
\p “\add Okay,\add*” Shimshon \add responded\add*. “\add But\add* promise me that you all won’t \add injure\add* me yourselves.”
\p
\v 13 “No, however, we’ll certainly tie you up,” they \add replied\add*, “and we’ll hand you over to them. But truly we won’t kill you.” Then they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the \add rocks\add*.
\p
\v 14 \add When they’d taken him\add* as far as Lehi, the Philistines shouted \add triumphantly\add* \add when they saw\add* him. Then Yahweh’s spirit \add rose in\add* \add Shimshon\add* and the ropes \add around\add* his arms \add just seemed as weak as burnt\add* flax stalks \add when he simply snapped them off him\add*.
\v 15 He saw a fresh donkey’s jawbone \add lying on the ground\add*, and he reached out his hand and \add grabbed\add* it, and he slaughtered a thousand \add Philistine\add* men with it.
\v 16 Then Shimshon \add declared\add*,
\q1 “With a donkey’s jawbone, one heap, two heaps,
\q1 with a donkey’s jawbone, I’ve slaughtered a thousand men.”
\m
\v 17 When he finished \add reciting that\add*, he hurled the jawbone \add away\add*, and he called that place ‘Ramat-Lehi’ \add (which means ‘jawbone hill’)\add*.
\p
\v 18 Then he was very thirsty and cried out to Yahweh, “You yourself have given your servant this great victory, \add but\add* now must I die with this thirst and \add get captured by those\add* uncircumcised \add Philistines\add*?”
\v 19 \add So\add* God split open the \add little\add* hollow that’s at Lehi, and water came out of it. When he drank, his \add strength\add* returned and he revived. Because of that, he called it ‘En-Hakkore’ \add (which means ‘the fountain of the one who called out’)\add*, which is in Lehi to this day.
\v 20 And \add so\add* \add Shimshon\add* led Israel for twenty years at the time of the Philistine \add oppression\add*.
\c 16
\s1 Shimshon carries away the gates
\p
\v 1 Samson went to Gaza \add city\add* and he saw a prostitute woman there \add so he went in to spend the night with\add* her.
\v 2 \add But\add* the Gazites \add passed around the news\add*, “Shimshon’s \add in town\add*.” So they encircled the city gate and they laid in wait for him all night. They \add stayed\add* quiet the whole night, saying, “We’ll kill him \add when it gets light\add*.”
\v 3 Samson \add stayed with her\add* until the middle of the night, then he got up. He picked up both the gates including the cross-bar and their posts, and hoisted them up onto his shoulders, and he carried them up to the top of the hill which is in front of Hebron.
\s1 Shimshon and Delilah
\p
\v 4 \add Sometime\add* after that, \add Shimshon\add* fell in love with a \add Philistine\add* woman named Delilah who \add lived in\add* the Sorek valley.
\v 5 The Philistine leaders came to her and \add requested\add*, “Make him open up. \add Find out what makes him strong, and how we can beat\add* him, so that we can tie him up \add to keep him in our power\add*. Then we’ll each give you one thousand one hundred silver coins.”
\p
\v 6 So Delilah \add asked\add* Shimshon, “Please, tell me \add what makes you so strong\add*, and how \add could someone tie you up to keep you in their power\add*?”
\p
\v 7 “If they’d tie me up with seven green cords that haven’t been dried,” \add he\add* \add replied\add*, “then I’d become weak and be just like any other \add man\add*.”
\p
\v 8 \add So\add* the Philistine leaders brought her seven green cords that hadn’t been dried, and she tied him up with them.
\v 9 Now she had an ambush \add group\add* \add ready\add* in the \add next\add* room when she said to him, “The Philistines are \add here to get\add* you, Shimshon!” But he tore the cords to shreds just like a strip of flax fiber is torn to shreds when \add the fire reaches it\add*, \add thus\add* \add they didn’t find out\add* \add the secret of\add* his strength.
\v 10 Then Delilah said to \add him\add*, “Listen, you deceived me and lied to me. Now tell me, please, \add how could someone tie you up?\add*”
\p
\v 11 “Actually, if they would tie me with new ropes \add which have never been used\add*,” he \add replied\add*, “I’d become weak and be just like any other \add man\add*.”
\p
\v 12 \add So\add* Delilah took new cords and tied him up with them. She said to him, “The Philistines are \add here to get\add* you, Shimshon!” with the ambush group staying in the \add next\add* room. But he flicked them off his arms like they were \add just\add* thread.
\p
\v 13 Then Delilah said to Shimshon, “\add So far\add* you’ve \add just\add* \add been deceitful to\add* me and told me lies. \add Now\add* Tell me how you can be tied up.”
\p So he told her, “\add It’s\add* if you just weave seven locks of my hair into the loom.”
\p
\v 14 \add So\add* \add she did it and\add* fastened it with the pin, and \add called out\add*, “The Philistines are \add here to get\add* you, Shimshon!” Then he woke up and \add ripped\add* out the pin, the loom, and \add his hair from\add* the fabric.
\p
\v 15 Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart isn’t with me? You’ve \add been deceitful to\add* me three times \add now\add*, and you haven’t revealed to me \add the secret of your amazing\add* strength.”
\v 16 \add Day after day she nagged and pestered him until he was sick to death of hearing it\add*.
\v 17 \add So\add* \add finally\add* he told her \add his secret\add*, “\add My hair has never been cut\add* because I’ve been a Nazirite to God \add since my birth\add*. If \add my head\add* would be shaved, then my strength would leave me, and I’d become weak—I’d be just like any other \add man\add*.”
\p
\v 18 When Delilah perceived that he’d told her \add his deepest secret\add*, she summoned the Philistine leaders, “Come \add here\add* one more time, because he’s told me \add his secret\add*.” \add So\add* the Philistine leaders came, bringing the silver \add coins\add* \add with them\add*.
\v 19 Then she made him fall asleep on her knees, and she called in a man to shave off his seven locks \add of hair\add*, causing him to start to weaken, and his \add additional\add* strength left him.
\v 20 Then she said, “The Philistines are \add here to get\add* you, Shimshon!” He woke up and \add thought to himself\add*, “I’ll escape like \add all the other times\add* and I’ll shake myself loose.” But he didn’t know that Yahweh had left him.
\v 21 \add So\add* the Philistines seized him, and they gouged out his eyes. They brought him to Gaza and chained him with a pair of bronze shackles, then \add they put him to work in prison\add* grinding \add grain\add*.
\v 22 \add However,\add* \add over time\add* his hair began to grow back again.
\s1 Shimshon’s death
\p
\v 23 \add Some time later,\add* the Philistine leaders gathered together for a celebration and to offer a large sacrifice to their god Dagon, saying, “Our god has \add helped us capture\add* our terrible enemy, Shimshon.”
\v 24 When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, “Our god has \add helped us capture\add* our enemy—the devastator of our region who \add killed so many of us\add*.”
\v 25 \add Later in the celebration when the drink had liberated their thinking\add*, they said, “Call for Shimshon so he can \add entertain us\add*.” So they \add brought\add* Shimshon in from the \add prison\add* and \add taunted him\add* \add to get them all laughing\add*. They made him stand among the pillars \add of the building\add*
\v 26 and \add he\add* \add asked\add* the servant who was \add guiding him\add* by the hand, “Place my hands against the two pillars holding up the building \add so\add* I can lean on them.”
\v 27 The building was full of the men and the women, \add including\add* the Philistine leaders. On the roof there were about three thousand men and women watching the entertainment with Shimshon.
\p
\v 28 Then Shimshon called out to Yahweh, “My master Yahweh, please remember me. Strengthen me please, just this time, oh God, so that I can avenge myself by one \add last\add* act of vengeance on the Philistines \add to make them pay for\add* my two eyes.”
\v 29 Then \add he\add* took hold of the two centre pillars on which the building depended, and \add pressed out\add* against them—one in his right hand and one in his left.
\v 30 Then \add he\add* \add exclaimed\add*, “\add Let me\add* die with the Philistines!” He stretched out with his strength and the building fell on \add their\add* leaders and all of the people in it. \add So\add* he killed more people at his death than he had killed during his life.
\p
\v 31 Then his brothers and all his father’s household went \add to Gaza\add* and carried \add his body\add* back. They buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial place of his father Manoah. He had \add helped\add* Israel for twenty years.
\c 17
\s1 The false gods of Mikiyas
\p
\v 1 \add Now\add* there was a man named Micah from the hill country of Ephraim
\v 2 who \add admitted\add* to his mother, “Those \add eleven\add* hundred silver coins that were taken from you—\add when you made\add* a curse, and \add even said it when I was listening\add*, \add well\add* listen, \add I’ve got it all\add*—I took it myself.”
\p His mother said, “May Yahweh bless you, my son.”
\v 3 Then he brought back the \add eleven\add* hundred silver coins to his mother and \add she\add* \add declared\add*, “I will certainly consecrate the money to Yahweh \add for my son’s benefit\add*. \add Take it and we’ll use it to have one statue carved and another cast\add*.”
\v 4 \add So after the money had been returned,\add* his mother gave two hundred silver coins to a silversmith. He made a carved figure and one cast \add from a mould\add*, and \add they were placed\add* in Micah’s house.
\p
\v 5 Now that Micah had a \add shrine with gods in it\add*, he made \add some priestly robes\add* and \add some household gods\add*, and consecrated one of his sons as his priest.
\v 6 In those days, Israel didn’t have a king—each \add person\add* would do whatever \add seemed right to them\add*.
\p
\v 7 \add Now\add* there was a young Levite man from the family of Yehudah\f + \fr 17:7 \ft Maybe one parent was from the tribe of Levi and one from Yehudah?\f* who’d been staying in Bethlehem (in Yehudah).
\v 8 \add He\add* left Bethlehem to find another place to say, and on his way, he \add ended up arriving\add* at Micah’s place in the Efraimite hill country.
\v 9 “Where have you come from?” Micah \add asked\add* him.
\p “I’m a Levite from Bethlehem in Yehudah,” he \add replied\add*, “and I’m \add trying to find a good place to stay a while\add*.”
\p
\v 10 “Stay with me,” said Micah, “and be like a father and a priest to me. I’ll give you ten silver coins a year as well as \add board and clothing\add*.” So the Levite \add man\add* went in
\v 11 and agreed to stay with \add Micah\add*, \add eventually\add* becoming like one of Micah’s \add own\add* sons.
\v 12 Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became like a priest to him, and lived in \add his\add* house.
\v 13 “Now I know that Yahweh will \add make everything go well\add* for me,” Micah said, “because I have this Levite as a priest.”
\c 18
\s1 The Danites settle in Layish
\p
\v 1 In those days, Israel \add didn’t have a\add* king. The tribe of Dan was looking for land to settle in, because up \add until then\add*, \add they hadn’t been able to claim their allocated region\add* among the Israeli tribes.
\v 2 \add So\add* the Danites sent out five capable men (from Zorah and from Eshtaol) to scout out the region and explore it. They had told them, “Go \add and\add* explore the area.” They came to the Efraimite hill country, as far as Micah’s house, and spent the night there.
\v 3 They’d been near Micah’s house \add when\add* they recognized the voice of the young Levite man. So they’d \add gone in\add* there and they \add asked\add* him, “Who brought you here? What are you doing in this \add place\add*? What do you \add get\add* here?”
\p
\v 4 Then he told them what Micah had done for him, and how he’d hired him to be like his priest.
\p
\v 5 \add So\add* they \add asked\add* him, “Please find out from God if we’ll have success on this expedition we’re on.”
\p
\v 6 “\add Continue on\add* in peace,” the priest said. “Yahweh has \add prepared everything ahead\add* of you all.”
\p
\v 7 Then the five men left and \add went on\add* to Layish. They saw that the people \add there\add* were living in confidence \add just like\add* the Tsidonians were—\add peacefully\add* and \add feeling\add* secure. No one in the region was causing \add trouble\add* for them and \add they were very settled\add*. They were far away from the Tsidonians and \add didn’t interact with others\add*.
\v 8 Then they went \add back\add* to their relatives in Tsorah and Eshtaol, who \add asked\add* them, “How \add did it go\add*?”
\v 9 “Get \add ready immediately\add*,” they \add said\add*, “so that we can go \add to battle\add* against them! Because we’ve seen the land and listen, it’s incredible good. \add Don’t just still there\add*—you all \add need to take action\add* to go in to \add take possession of\add* the land.
\p
\v 10 When you go, you’ll all come to a people living \add without suspicion of attack\add*, and the land is spacious in \add all directions\add*, because God \add will hand it over to you\add*—a place where there’s no lack of anything that’s on the earth.”
\p
\v 11 So six hundred Danite \add warriors\add* left Tsorah and Eshtaol, carrying their weapons.
\v 12 They \add set off\add* and camped at Kiriat-Yearim in Yehudah. \add That’s why\add* they call that place Mahaneh-Dan \add (meaning ‘Dan’s camp’)\add* to this day—it’s back behind Kiriat-Yearim.
\v 13 From there, they crossed over into the Efraimite hill country, \add eventually\add* \add arriving near\add* Micah’s house.
\p
\v 14 Then the five men who had \add been here previously\add* scouting out the land said to their \add group\add*, “Do you know that there’s \add a house here\add* with a \add gear for priests\add*, family idols, a carved image, and a cast image? So now, consider what you should do.”
\v 15 So they turned \add off the main path\add* and they came to the place with the young Levite man in Micah’s house, and they asked about his welfare.
\v 16 The six hundred Danite men stayed outside at the gate, holding their weapons.
\p
\v 17 The five men who’d gone to scout out the land went in \add around the back\add*. They took the carved image, the priest’s gear, the family idols, and the cast image, while the priest was standing at the entrance of the gate along with the six hundred armed men.
\v 18 When the priest saw them bringing out \add all the religious objects\add*, he \add demanded\add*, “\add What’s going on\add*?”
\p
\v 19 “Stay quiet,” they told him. “Put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and be like a father and a priest for us. Is it better to be a priest for \add only\add* \add one household\add*, or to be a priest for a \add whole\add* related tribe in Israel?”
\v 20 The priest \add liked that idea\add*, so he went along with them—taking the \add priestly gear\add* and the \add household idols\add*, and the carved image.
\p
\v 21 Then they \add went back to the main path\add* and continued on their way with the children, animals, and \add those carrying\add* the valuable property going in front.
\v 22 When they’d already gone \add quite some\add* distance from Micah’s house, Micah and \add his neighbours\add* gathered together, then the men ran \add in a group\add* and caught up with the \add Danites\add*.
\v 23 They called \add out to the Danites\add* who turned around \add to face them\add* and \add asked\add* Micah, “What’s \add the matter? Why has this group come\add* together?”
\v 24 “You all took my gods that I made,” Micah \add replied\add*, “And the priest. Then you \add disappeared and I had nothing left\add*. \add So\add* how can you all \add ask\add* me what \add the matter is\add*!”
\p
\v 25 “\add I wouldn’t say too much if I was you,” he was told. “Otherwise some of our more fiery men might start to get a bit hostile, then you’d bring about your own death, and that of your companions\add*!”
\v 26 Then Micah realised that they were too strong for \add them\add*, so \add they\add* turned back around and went home.
\p \add So\add* the Danites continued onward,
\v 27 taking with them the things that Micah had made, as well as his priest. They came to Layish where the unsuspecting people were living peaceably, and they slaughtered them with their swords and burnt down the city.
\v 28 \add No one came to rescue them\add* because it was \add a long way\add* from Tsidon and \add they did have much involvement with them anyway\add*. (\add Layish\add* was in the valley near Beyt-Rehob.) They rebuilt the city and then \add moved into\add* it.
\v 29 They named the \add rebuilt\add* city Dan (instead of Layish) in honour of their ancestor Dan who was one of Israel’s sons.
\v 30 The Danites \add mounted\add* the carved image for themselves \add to worship\add*. Yonatan (Gershom’s son from Manashsheh) became the priest for the Danites (and then his descendants until when the people were \add eventually\add* exiled from the region).
\v 31 \add So\add* they set up the carved image that Micah had made \add and worshipped it\add* \add the whole time that God’s tent\add* was at Shiloh.
\c 19
\s1 The Levite and his slave-wife
\p
\v 1 In those days when there was no king over Israel, there was a Levite man who was staying in the remotest parts of the hill country of Efraim. He took a slave-wife for himself from Bethlehem in Yehudah.
\v 2 \add However\add*, \add she\add* started sleeping around, and then she left him and went to her father’s house in Bethlehem \add where she ended up\add* staying for four months.
\v 3 Then her husband \add got organised\add* and went after her—to \add sweet-talk\add* her and persuade her to return with him. He took a young \add servant\add* man and a team of donkeys. She invited \add her husband\add* into her father’s house, and when \add her\add* father saw him, he was glad to meet him.
\v 4 His father-in-law (her father) insisted \add on offering hospitality\add*, so they ate and drank, and he stayed the night, and \add ended up\add* staying for three days.
\v 5 Then on the fourth day, they got up early and \add the Levite\add* prepared to leave, but his father-in-law \add urged him to eat before they left\add*.
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* the two of them ate and drank together, and then the woman’s father said, “Please stay \add another\add* night. \add Relax and have a good time\add*.”
\p
\v 7 The man got ready to leave, however his father-in-law persisted, so he stayed \add another\add* night there.
\v 8 He got up early in the morning on the fifth day to get ready to leave, but the father of the young woman said, “\add Get some energy first\add*.” So they waited until later in the day, and then the two of them ate.
\p
\v 9 \add When\add* the man stood up to go with his slave-wife and his young man, his father-in-law said, “Listen, the day’s \add coming to an end soon\add*. Please stay the night. See, \add it’ll be getting dark soon\add*. Spend the night here and \add be happy\add*. Then make an early start tomorrow for your journey \add home\add*.”
\p
\v 10 \add But\add* the man from the tribe of Levi didn’t want to stay another night. He put saddles on his two donkeys, and started to go with his slave-wife and his servant toward Yebus city (now called Yerushalem).
\p
\v 11 They got close to Yebus and the daylight had \add mostly gone, so\add* the young man said to his master, “Come, please, we should turn aside into this city of the Yebusites so we can spend the night there.”
\v 12 “We won’t \add go\add* into a into a city of \add foreigners\add*, his master \add replied\add*. “There’s no \add Israelis there\add*. \add Better to keep going until we\add* reach Gibeah.”
\v 13 Then he \add added\add*, “\add Yes, let’s keep going to reach\add* either Gibeah or Ramah to spend the night in.”
\v 14 So they passed \add Yebus\add* and went on, \add but\add* the sun went down as they neared Gibeah (in Benyamite \add territory\add*)
\v 15 \add so\add* they went into Gibeah to spend the night there. They went and sat in the open plaza of the city, \add but\add* no one \add invited them into their home for the night\add*.
\p
\v 16 \add But\add* then in \add late\add* evening, an old man came in from his work in the field. \add He\add* was from the Efraimite hill country \add but\add* \add currently\add* staying in the Gibeah area \add where\add* the \add residents\add* were Benyamites.
\v 17 He \add looked up\add* and \add noticed them\add* in the open plaza of the city and \add asked\add* the man, “Where are you going, and where have you come from?”
\p
\v 18 “We’re passing through from Bethlehem in Yehudah,” \add the Levite\add* \add replied\add*. “Going to the remote parts of the Efraimite hill country \add where I’m from\add*. I went to Bethlehem, and I’m going to \add Shiloh where\add* Yahweh’s house is. \add However,\add* no one \add here has invited us into their home\add*.
\v 19 \add We have our own\add* food and straw for our donkeys, and \add enough\add* food and wine for \add the three of us\add* \add so\add* we don’t need anything else.
\p
\v 20 “Peace to you all,” said the old man. “\add Let me supply\add* everything you need—only don’t spend the night \add here\add* in the square.”
\v 21 Then he took \add them\add* to his house and fed \add their\add* donkeys. They washed their feet, and they \add all\add* ate and drank.
\v 22 They were \add having a good time\add*, but suddenly the men of the city—wicked men—had \add surrounded\add* the house—pounding repeatedly on the door. They \add called out\add* to the old man \add who owned\add* the house, “\add Hey,\add* bring out the man who came to your \add place\add*, so we \add can have fun with\add* him.”\f + \fr 19:22 \ft Of course, everyone understood that their aim was to sodomise him.\f*\x + \xo 19:22-24: \xt Gen 19:5-8.\x*
\v 23 The man \add who owned\add* the house went out to them and said to them, “No, my brothers, please you mustn’t act wickedly. \add That man is a guest in\add* my house—you all mustn’t do this disgraceful thing.
\v 24 My virgin daughter and his slave-wife are here. Please let me bring \em them\em* out so you can ravish them and do \add whatever you want\add* to them. But don’t do that wicked thing to that man.”
\v 25 But the men weren’t willing to listen to him, so the man \add pushed his slave-wife out\add* to them and they \add raped\add* her and abused her the whole night until the morning, \add when\add* they \add discarded\add* her \add as it began to\add* dawn.
\p
\v 26 The woman \add managed to get herself back to\add* the house where her master was, and \add collapsed\add* at the entrance until \add it got light\add*.
\v 27 \add When\add* her master got up and he opened the door to go \add and continue on his trip\add*, look, his slave-wife had fallen at the entrance and her hands were on the threshold.
\v 28 “Get up,” he told her. “Let’s go.” But she didn’t answer, so he put her on his donkey and \add headed\add* home.
\v 29 When he \add arrived\add*, he got a knife and hacked his wife’s \add body\add* into twelve pieces (\add including the\add* bones), and he sent \add them\add* \add to various places spread across\add* all of Israel’s territory.
\v 30 Then everyone who saw \add a piece\add* said, “Nothing has \add ever\add* happened like this before—we’ve never seen anything like this from the time that the \add Israelis\add* left Egypt until \add now\add*. \add What do we need to do about it?\add* Speak up and make a plan.”
\c 20
\s1 The preparation of Israelis of war
\p
\v 1 Then all the Israelis from Dan \add in the north\add* to Beer-Sheva \add in the south\add*, and \add even\add* from Gilead \add across the Yordan\add*, came and assembled before Yahweh at Mitspah with \add one single, united purpose\add*.
\v 2 The leaders of all the Israeli tribes \add also came out to show their agreement with\add* the assembly of the people of the true God: four hundred thousand warriors all carrying swords.
\p
\v 3 \add Meanwhile,\add* the \add Benyamites\add* had heard that the \add Israelis\add* had gathered at Mitspah, and \add everyone asked\add*, “Explain how this wicked thing \add came to happen\add*.”
\p
\v 4 \add So\add* the Levite man (the husband of the woman who had been murdered) answered, “I went to the Gibeah \add region\add* (in Benyamin) with my slave-wife to spend the night.
\v 5 The citizens of Gibeah \add conspired\add* \add together\add* against me. They surrounded the house at night because of me, intending to kill me. Instead, they assaulted \add and abused\add* my slave-wife \add so that\add* she died.
\v 6 I took my slave-wife’s \add body\add* back \add home\add* and cut her in pieces, and I sent \add them\add* out into every \add section of the territory that God gave\add* Israel, because they’ve committed a heinous crime, and a disgrace to Israel.
\v 7 Listen, all of you Israelis, \add what’s your advice? What should we do about it?\add*.”
\p
\v 8 All the people \add agreed together and\add* started saying, “We won’t go back to our \add families\add*. We won’t return to our houses.
\v 9 \add rather\add* this is what we must do to Gibeah: \add choose by lot who will fight against\add* \add them\add*.
\v 10 \add Choose a tenth of our men\add* to \add go and\add* get supplies \add for the other warriors to travel\add* to Gibeah in Benyamin \add after what they did that\add* outraged Israel.
\v 11 \add So\add* all Israel was united together against that city.
\p
\v 12 Then the Israeli tribes sent men \add across the Benyamite region to ask\add*, “What’s this \add evil thing\add* that’s been done among you?
\v 13 \add So\add* now, hand over those worthless men from the Gibeah \add region\add* so that we can put them to death and purge Israel of that evil.” But the Benyamites weren’t willing to \add take the advice of their Israeli relatives\add*.
\v 14 \add They\add* came out of their cities \add and assembled\add* at Gibeah to the battle against the \add Israelis\add*.
\v 15 The \add Benyamites \add* mobilised together twenty-six thousand men from their cities on that day, all carrying \add swords\add*. In addition, seven hundred chosen men had been mobilised from the Gibeah \add region\add*.
\v 16 Among all of those people were seven hundred chosen left-handers, each of whom could sling a stone at a hair without missing.
\v 17 The Israelis (excluding Benyamites) mustered up for themselves four hundred thousand men—all \add expert warriors\add* and all carrying \add swords\add*.
\s1 The war to punish the Benyamites
\p
\v 18 The \add Israelis\add* got ready and went to Beyt-El and asked God, “Who should \add lead us into\add* battle with the \add Benyamites\add*?”
\p “It should be Yehudah \add out front,\add*” Yahweh \add responded\add*.
\p
\v 19 \add So\add* the \add Israelis set out\add* in the morning and made camp near Gibeah.
\v 20 Then \add they\add* went out to battle against the Benyamites—setting themselves up for the battle against them at Gibeah.
\p
\v 21 \add But the Benyamites led a surprise attack\add* out of Gibeah and killed twenty-two thousand of the \add Israeli warriors\add*.
\v 22 \add However the Israelis\add* strengthened themselves and they continued to set up for battle \add the next\add* day at the \add same\add* place.
\p
\v 23 Then the \add Israelis assembled\add* and wept before Yahweh until evening. They asked \add him\add*, “Should \add we\add* continue to attack and battle against \add our\add* \add cousins the Benyamites\add*?”
\p “Go \add back\add* against \add them\add*,” Yahweh \add replied\add*.
\v 24 \add So the Israelis went back to battle against the Benyamites\add* \add again\add* on the second day.
\v 25 \add Again\add* the Benyamites came out from Gibeah, and \add this time\add* they killed eighteen thousand \add Israeli swordsmen\add*.
\v 26 Then the \add Israeli warriors\add* and all the people went \add back\add* to Beyt-El. They wept, and they sat there before Yahweh. They fasted that day until the evening, then they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to Yahweh.
\v 27 \add They\add* asked Yahweh (because the box containing the agreement with the true God was there in those days
\v 28 and Finehas (son of Aharon’s son Eleazar) was serving before it in those days), “Should \add we\add* continue to go to the battle once more against the our \add cousins the Benyamites\add*, or should \add we\add* stop?”
\p “Go \add back\add* \add again\add*, because tomorrow I’ll give \add you victory over them\add*,” Yahweh \add responded\add*.
\p
\v 29 \add So the Israelis\add* placed \add groups of warriors in ambush\add* \add all\add* around Gibeah.
\v 30 Then \add they\add* \add took their positions\add* \add now\add* for the third day against the Benyamites in Gibeah.
\v 31 \add When the Benyamites\add* came out from the city, they were lured away as they began to strike down their enemies like the time before. Around thirty \add Israelis\add* were killed on the \add two\add* roads—one going to Beyt-El and the other to Gibeah through the countryside.
\v 32 Then the \add Benyamites\add* said, “\add We’re starting to defeat them\add*, just \add like before\add*.”
\p But the \add Israelis\add* had said, “Let’s flee so that we can draw \add them\add* away from the city \add and\add* onto the roads.”
\v 33 Then \add the main group\add* of \add Israelis retreated\add* and set up battle lines at Baal-Tamar, \add as\add* the ones hiding in ambush \add made a surprise attack\add* from \add their places\add* in Maareh-Gibeah.
\v 34 Ten thousand \add chosen Israeli warriors\add* came out in the sight of the Gibeah region, and the battle was fierce, \add but\add* \add the Benyamites\add* hadn’t yet realised that \add disaster was about to hit them\add*.
\v 35 Yahweh \add helped the Israelis to defeat the Benyamites\add* that day, and \add over\add* twenty-five thousand \add Benyamite\add* \add swordsmen were killed\add*
\v 36 and \add they\add* saw that they were defeated.
\p The \add Israelis\add* had given ground to the \add Benyamites\add* because they had relied on the ambush placed around Gibeah.
\v 37 Then the group hiding in ambush had rushed out and spread out around Gibeah, then had gone in and \add attacked the entire city with their swords\add*.
\v 38 Then they \add started a fire\add* as the \add prearranged signal\add* was to be the rising column of smoke up out of the city.
\p
\v 39 Meanwhile the \add main\add* \add Israeli force\add* had retreated, and the Benyamites had attacked and killed around thirty men, thinking that they were winning like they’d done \add twice\add* before.
\v 40 \add But when\add* the pillar of smoke began to rise from the city, the \add Benyamites\add* looked behind them and were shocked to see \add their city going up in smoke\add*.
\v 41 Then the \add main\add* \add Israeli force\add* \add stopped retreating and\add* turned back \add to attack again\add*. The \add Benyamites\add* were horrified because \add they\add* \add now\add* saw that disaster had struck them.
\v 42 They retreated away from the \add Israelis\add* into the wilderness, but the battle overtook \add them\add*, plus \add the Israelis\add* were coming \add back\add* out of the cities \add getting right in amongst them\add* \add to fight\add*.
\v 43 They surrounded \add the Benyamites as they tried to flee\add*, and easily ran \add them\add* down as \add they tried to escape from the Gibeah region towards the east\add*.
\v 44 Eighteen thousand strong \add Benyamite warriors were killed\add*,
\v 45 and \add the rest\add* turned and fled into the wilderness towards the Rimmon rock. \add Another five thousand men were killed\add* along the trails. They chased them \add all the way\add* to Gidom, and killed \add another\add* two thousand men,
\v 46 \add so the total number of Benyamite swordsmen who were killed came to\add* twenty-five thousand—all strong \add warriors\add*.
\p
\v 47 \add But\add* six hundred men \add made it\add* to Rimmon rock, and they stayed there for four months.
\v 48 \add Meanwhile, the Israelis\add* went back to the Benyamite \add region\add* and killed the people with their swords—entire cities including cattle and everything else—then the cities were set on fire.

\s1 Wives for the Benyamites
\p
\v 1 \add Now\add* \add back\add* in Mitspah, the Israeli men had promised never to allow their daughters \add to marry\add* a Benyamite man.
\v 2 \add But\add* \add now\add* the Israelis went to Beyt-El and sat there before God until evening—calling out and crying loudly,
\v 3 \add asking\add*, “Oh Yahweh, God of Israel, why has this happened to Israel—for one tribe \add to be missing\add* from Israel \add now\add*?”
\p
\v 4 The next day, the people got up early and built an altar there, and they offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings.
\v 5 Then the \add Israelis asked\add*, “Among all the Israeli tribes serving Yahweh, \add was there any group who didn’t join the battle\add*?” (\add They asked that\add* because they had \add previously decided that anyone who didn’t go to Mitspah to fight for Yahweh would\add* be put to death.)
\v 6 \add Now the Israelis felt sorry for their Benyamite cousins\add*, saying, “An \add entire\add* tribe has been \add hacked off\add* Israel today.
\v 7 \add How can we find wives for any\add* \add Benyamite\add* men that are left because we’ve promised to Yahweh not to give our daughters to them \add to marry\add*?
\p
\v 8 \add So\add* they \add asked\add*, “Is there any \add from our tribes\add* who didn’t \add show up for\add* Yahweh at Mitspah?” Then listen, no one from Yabesh-Gilead had \add joined their assembly\add* \add there\add*.
\v 9 (\add When\add* the people had \add checked around\add* themselves, \add they’d realised that\add* no one from Yabesh-Gilead was there.)
\v 10 \add So the Israelis\add* sent twelve thousand \add warriors\add* there, commanding them to use their swords to kill the inhabitants of Yabesh-Gilead, including \add married\add* women and \add children\add*—
\v 11 \add specifically\add* they had to kill every male, and every woman who’s \add slept with\add* a male.
\v 12 \add That way\add* they discovered four hundred young virgin women among the inhabitants of Yabesh-Gilead, and brought them \add back\add* to their camp at Shiloh (in the Canaan \add region\add*).
\p
\v 13 Then the entire assembly sent a message to the \add Benyamites\add* at Rimmon rock, \add saying that they were now ready for peace\add*.
\v 14 So the \add Benyamites\add* returned and were given the young women from Yabesh-Gilead, \add but\add* there wasn’t enough of them.
\p
\v 15 The people \add still\add* felt sorry for the \add Benyamites\add*, because Yahweh had \add caused\add* a gap among Israel’s tribes,
\v 16 \add so the leaders asked\add*, “How can we provide wives for the remaining \add Benyamite men\add* since \add the other\add* Benyamite women \add were wiped out\add*?”
\v 17 \add Because\add* they said, “\add They must be able to procreate so that\add* an entire Israeli tribe isn’t blotted out.
\v 18 \add But we can’t be the ones to give our daughters to them to marry because we made an oath that anyone who did that would\add* be cursed.”
\p
\v 19 They said, “Listen, there’s a celebration for Yahweh from time to time at Shiloh, which is on the north of Beyt-El, east of the road that goes from Beyt-El uphill to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.”
\v 20 \add So\add* they \add told the Benyamites\add*, “Go and hide in those vineyards
\v 21 and watch. \add When\add* the Shiloh girls come out to \add perform\add* in the dances, come out of the vineyards and you can each catch a wife for yourselves, then go \add back home\add* to Benyamin.
\v 22 \add When\add* their fathers or brothers complain to us, we’ll tell them, “\add Let them have them since we didn’t find you for them. And you all won’t be guilty of giving them to the Benyamites\add* \add because they stole them\add*.
\p
\v 23 \add So that’s what the Benyamites\add* did—they grabbed enough dancing girls to be their wives, then they returned to their \add allocated land\add* and rebuilt their cities and lived in them.
\v 24 The \add other\add* \add Israelis\add* went back to their tribes and their families in the areas that \add had been allocated to them\add*.
\p
\v 25 In those days, there was no king in Israel—everyone would \add just\add* do \add what seemed right to them\add*.\x + \xo 21:25: \xt Jdg 17:6.\x*
