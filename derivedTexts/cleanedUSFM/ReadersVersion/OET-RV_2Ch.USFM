\s1 The requesting of Solomon of wisdom
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (1 Kgs 3:1-15)
\p
\v 1 David’s son Shelomoh \add (Solomon)\add* became established over his kingdom and his god, Yahweh, was with him and \add made him very powerful\add*.
\p
\v 2 Shelomoh spoke to all Yisrael \add (Israel)\add*, to the army commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, to all of Yisrael’s leaders, including the clan leaders.
\v 3 \add So\add* Shelomoh led all the assembly to the \add worship place\add* at Gibeon because the \add sacred tent\add* was there that Yahweh’s servant Mosheh \add (Moses)\add* had made in the wilderness.
\v 4 David had brought God’s box uphill from Kiryat-Yearim \add and\add* \add he’d\add* erected a tent for it in Yerushalem \add (Jerusalem)\add*.\x + \xo 1:4: \xt 2Sam 6:1-17; 1Ch 13:5-14; 15:25–16:1.\x*
\v 5 The bronze altar made by Betsalel (son of Uri, son of Hur) was there \add in front of\add* Yahweh’s tent, and Shelomoh and the assembly \add requested Yahweh’s guidance there\add*.\x + \xo 1:5: \xt Exo 38:1-7.\x*
\v 6 \add So\add* Shelomoh went up to the bronze altar there at the \add sacred tent\add*, and \add in front of\add* Yahweh, he sacrificed one thousand burnt offerings on it.
\p
\v 7 That night, God appeared to Shelomoh and told him, “Ask for what \add you want\add* me to give you.”
\p
\v 8 “You showed outstanding loyal commitment to my father David,” Shelomoh \add replied\add* to God, “and you’ve made me king in his place.
\v 9 Now, Yahweh God, may your promise to my father David be confirmed, for you yourself have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust on the ground.
\v 10 Give me wisdom and knowledge now \add as\add* I come and go in front of these people, because who could make \add good\add* judgements for this great people of yours?”
\p
\v 11 “Because that was in your heart,” God \add replied\add* to Shelomoh “and you didn’t ask for wealth, riches, or \add fame\add*, or the life of those who hate you, and also you didn’t ask \add for a long life\add*, but you’ve asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself \add to help you lead\add* my people that I’ve made you king over,
\v 12 then I’ll give you \add that\add* wisdom and knowledge, \add along with\add* wealth and riches and fame. You’ll have more than any king that preceded you or any that follows.”

\p
\v 13 Then Shelomoh left the \add sacred\add* tent at Gibeon and returned to Yerushalem, where he reigned over Yisrael.
\v 14 Then Shelomoh built up \add his\add* chariots and horsemen, and \add soon had\add* 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen which he stationed in the chariot cities and with \add him\add* in Yerushalem.\x + \xo 1:14: \xt 1Ki 4:26.\x*
\v 15 The king made silver and gold in Yerushalem as \add common\add* as stones, and he made \add imported\add* cedar \add timber\add* as \add common\add* as the \add local\add* sycamore trees that were \add plentiful\add* in the lowlands.
\v 16 Shelomoh’s horses \add were imported\add* from Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add* and from the traders in Kue \add (in modern southern Türkiye/Turkey)\add*.\x + \xo 1:16: \xt Deu 17:16.\x*
\v 17 \add Egyptian chariots cost\add* six hundred silver coins and horses cost one hundred and fifty. (The Hittites and Aramean kings were able to get them \add for the same price\add*.)

\s1 Preparations for temple construction
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (1 Kgs 5:1-18)
\p
\v 1 Then Shelomoh \add decided to build a temple to honour\add* Yahweh, as well as a \add palace for himself\add*,
\v 2 \add so he conscripted\add* seventy thousand men as porters, eighty thousand as stone-cutters in the hillside quarries, and 3,600 supervisors.
\p
\v 3 Shelomoh \add ontacted\add* King Hiram in Tsor \add (Tyre)\add*, “\add In the time of\add* my father David, you sent cedar \add timber\add* to him so he could build himself a palace to live in.
\v 4 Listen, I am building a \add temple to honour\add* my god Yahweh, to consecrate to him. There we’ll sacrifice spiced incense to him, plus the regular \add bread\add* display, and burnt offerings in the morning and in the evening, on rest days and on the new moons, and \add other\add* appointed times of Yahweh our god. \add Yisrael is required to do\add* this forever.
\v 5 \add We want to build an impressive building, because our god is more powerful\add* than all \add the other\add* gods.
\v 6 \add But\add* who could \add stay strong enough\add* to build a house for him, since the \add sky\add* and the heavens of the heavens can’t contain him? And who am I that I could build for him a house for him—\add maybe I’m good enough to burn incense to him\add*?\x + \xo 2:6: \xt 1Ki 8:27; 2Ch 6:18.\x*
\v 7 \add So then,\add* send me a skilled man who can work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple and crimson and violet, and who knows how to engrave. \add He will work\add* with the skilled \add craftsmen\add* who my father David appointed and who are with me \add here\add* in Yerushalem and across Yehudah.
\v 8 \add Also,\add* send to me cedar, cypress, and algum timber from \add there in\add* Lebanon, because I myself know that your servants know how to cut the trees from Lebanon’s \add forests\add*. And listen, my servants will \add help\add* your servants
\v 9 so they can supply me with plenty of timber, because the temple that I’m building will be large and beautiful.
\v 10 I’ll pay your wood-cutters three thousand tonnes of ground wheat and the same of barley, four hundred thousand litres of wine and the same of \add olive\add* oil.
\p
\v 11 King Hiram of Tsor \add (Tyre)\add* wrote back to \add King\add* Shelomoh, “Yahweh has appointed you as king over his people because he loves them.
\v 12 Blessed be Yisrael’s god Yahweh who made the heavens and the earth, who’s given King David the king a wise son with insight and understanding, who’ll build a temple for Yahweh and a palace for his kingdom.
\p
\v 13 “I’ll send Huram-Avi to you—he’s a skilled craftsman
\v 14 \add His mother’s\add* from the \add tribe\add* of Dan, and his father a man of Tsor, knowing to work in gold and silver, in bronze and iron, in stone and in timber, in purple and in violet, in fine linen and in crimson, and \add do any kind of\add* engraving. \add He can follow any pattern\add* that’s given to him by your \add designers, and the designers\add* of my master, David, your father.
\v 15 \add So then go ahead \add* and send the wheat, barley, \add olive\add* oil, and wine that \add you\add* promised to send to \add us\add*,
\v 16 then we’ll cut the trees you need from Lebanon and raft them to Yafo by sea. \add The responsibility of getting them up the hills to Yerushalem will be yours\add*.
\s1 Temple construction begins
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (1 Kgs 6:1-38)
\p
\v 17 Shelomoh had all the foreign men living in Yisrael counted (similar to what his father David had done), and it came to 153,600.
\v 18 He conscripted seventy thousand as porters, eighty thousand as stone-cutters, and 3,600 as supervisors to keep the others working.
\c 3
\p
\v 1 Then Shelomoh began to build Yahweh’s temple on Mt. Moriyah in Yerushalem, where \add Yahweh\add* had appeared to his father David. It was at the threshing floor of Ornan the Yebusite where David \add had planned for it\add*,\x + \xo 3:1: \xt Gen 22:22.\x*
\v 2 and they began the construction in early-May of the fourth year of Shelomoh’s reign.\f + \fr 3:2 \ft Probably in 966 B.C.\f*
\v 3 \add The temple foundation was twenty-seven metres long and nine metres wide\add*,
\v 4 and the nine metre long front entrance porch was nine metres high.\f + \fr 3:4 \ft Most modern translations assume that the Hebrew ‘fifty-five metres high’ is an error.\f* \add Shelomoh\add* overlaid the inside \add walls\add* with pure gold.
\v 5 For the \add main building\add*, he overlaid it first with cypress planking, then with pure gold, then \add carved\add* palm trees and chains \add along the walls\add*.
\v 6 The gold \add they use\add* came from Parvaim.\f + \fr 3:6 \ft Probably somewhere south of Yisrael in the Arabian peninsula, but possibly to the east.\f* \add The main building\add* was \add also\add* overlaid with valuable gemstones.
\v 7 He overlaid the temple beams, thresholds, walls, and doors with gold, and he engraved winged creatures on the walls.
\p
\v 8 Then he made the\add most sacred room\add* \add inside\add* the temple. It was nine metres long \add (the full width of the temple)\add* and the same width. He overlaid it with thirty kilograms pure gold \add (beaten into thin sheets)\add*.\x + \xo 3:8: \xt Exo 26:33-34.\x*
\v 9 Each gold nail weighed half a kilogram, and he also overlaid the upper rooms with gold.
\p
\v 10 He cast \add molten metal\add* into two winged creatures in the \add most sacred room\add* and overlaid them with gold.\x + \xo 3:10-13: \xt Exo 25:18-20.\x*
\v 11 Each of the creatures had two wings, each 2.3 metres long. One of the wings reached the temple wall, and the other wing was stretched out to touch the other creature’s wingtip,
\v 12 and \add the same for its companion\add*,
\v 13 \add so\add* the total span of the two winged creatures was nine metres. They \add were made\add* standing on their feet, and \add placed\add* with their faces towards \add the opening into\add* the main hall.
\v 14 The \add curtain\add* \add separating the two rooms\add* was made from fine-linen with blue, purple, and red thread, and with winged creatures \add embroidered\add* onto it.\x + \xo 3:14: \xt Exo 26:31.\x*
\s1 The two bronze pillars
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (1 Kgs 7:15-22)
\p
\v 15 At the front of the temple, he made two sixteen metre tall pillars which each had a ‘capital’ topping that was another two metres high.
\v 16 \add Ornamental\add* chains were made for the inner sanctuary and to go around the tops of the pillars, and there were one hundred pomegranate \add models\add* hanging on the chains.
\v 17 There was one pillar on each side of the \add east-facing\add* entrance—the lefthand one was named Yakin and the righthand one was named Boaz.

\s1 The temple equipment
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (1 Kgs 7:23-51)
\p
\v 1 Then he made a \add square,\add* bronze altar, nine metres on each side and 4.5m high,\x + \xo 4:1: \xt Exo 27:1-2.\x*
\v 2 and he made the large, round metal \add water tank\add* (\add called\add* ‘The Sea’) which was 4.5m diameter and over two metres high.
\v 3 \add Below the outer rim were two rows of small, ornamental bulls spaced 45cm apart that were also part of the same casting\add*.
\v 4 \add Supporting ‘The Sea’ were twelve large cast bulls—facing outwards with three facing each of the four compass points\add*.
\v 5 \add The sides of the tank were eight centimeters thick. The tank’s brim was fashioned like the brim of a cup, resembling a lily blossom\add*. \add The tank\add* held sixty-six thousand litres of water.
\v 6 Then he made ten washbasins, placing five on \add each side for the priests to rinse the burnt offerings in\add*. The priests used ‘The Sea’ to wash in.\x + \xo 4:6: \xt Exo 30:17-21.\x*
\p
\v 7 He made the ten gold lampstands as per their design, and placed them in the temple \add with five on each side\add*.\x + \xo 4:7: \xt Exo 25:31-40.\x*
\v 8 He made ten tables and \add also\add* placed them in the temple \add with five on each side\add*, plus he made one hundred gold basins.\x + \xo 4:8: \xt Exo 25:23-30.\x*
\p
\v 9 He made the courtyard for the priests, as well as the large courtyard with its doors overlaid with bronze,
\v 10 and he placed ‘The Sea’ in the southeast corner.
\p
\v 11 \add Meanwhile,\add* Huram made the tubs and shovels \add (for the ashes from the altar)\add* and \add other small\add* bowls.
\p \add So\add* Huram finished the work for God’s temple that King Shelomoh had assigned to him:
\v 12 the two pillars, and the \add bowl-shaped\add* the capitals on top of each pillar, and the two \add sets of latticework\add* to cover those two bowls of the capitals,
\v 13 and the four hundred pomegranates for the latticework—two rows of pomegranates to cover each of the two bowls of the capitals that \add decorated the tops\add* of the pillars.
\v 14 He also made the washbasins and their stands,
\v 15 ‘The Sea’ and the twelve bulls that hold it up,
\v 16 and the tubs and shovels, the forks, and other utensils.
\p Those were all items made of polished bronze that Huram-Abi made for King Shelomoh for Yahweh’s temple.
\p
\v 17 The king had them cast in the clay between Sukkot and Tseredah \add down\add* by the Yordan River.
\v 18 Shelomoh had \add so many items made that they didn’t even try to weigh all\add* the bronze.
\p
\v 19 Shelomoh had all the items for God’s temple made, including the gold altar and the tables \add for displaying the sacred bread\add*,
\v 20 and the pure gold lampstands and their lamps for the inner sanctuary according to their designs,
\v 21 the pure gold flower \add ornaments\add*, lamps, tongs,
\v 22 the pure gold lamp trimmers, the basins and spoons, and fire pans. Also the temple entrance, its inner doors into the very sacred room, and the \add outer\add* temple doors were \add all\add* gold.
\c 5
\p
\v 1 \add After\add* all the work which Solomon did for Yahweh’s temple was completed, Solomon brought in the sacred things of his father David: the gold and silver, and all the items, he placed in the temple treasuries.\x + \xo 5:1: \xt 2Sam 8:11; 1Ch 18:11.\x*
\s1 Bringing the sacred box into the temple
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (1 Kgs 8:1-9)
\p
\v 2 Then Shelomoh assembled the Israeli elders, and all the heads of the tribes, the Israeli \add clan leaders\add* to Yerushalem, to bring the box \add containing\add* Yahweh’s agreement up \add the hill\add* from the city of David, that is, Tsiyyon \add (Zion)\add*.\x + \xo 5:2: \xt 2Sam 6:12-15; 1Ch 15:25-28.\x*
\v 3 \add So in October,\add* all those Israeli leaders gathered to be with the king for a feast,
\v 4 and once \add everyone was there\add*, the Levites lifted up the \add sacred\add* chest
\v 5 and carried it up \add towards the temple\add*. The priests (who are also Levites) carried it, along with the \add sacred\add* tent and everything that had been in it.
\v 6 Then King Shelomoh and all the assembled Israelis with him, gathered in front of the box, sacrificing sheep and cattle which were too many to count.
\v 7 The priests then took the box \add containing\add* Yahweh’s agreement, in to its place in the inner sanctuary of the house (the holy of holies)—to under the winged creatures
\v 8 whose outstretched wings would now be over the \add sacred\add* chest and even over the top of its carrying poles.
\v 9 \add Those long poles stuck out and could be seen from the front of that inner room, but couldn’t be seen from the main room\add*, and they’re still there to this day.
\v 10 There was nothing in the box except the two \add stone\add* tablets that Mosheh \add (Moses)\add* had \add put in\add* at Horev \add (Mt. Sinai)\add*, which \add represented the agreement that\add* Yahweh \add had made with the Israelis after\add* they’d left Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add*.\x + \xo 5:10: \xt Deu 10:5.\x*
\s1 Yahweh’s splendour
\s4 Full kingdom
\p
\v 11 \add Then the priests left the holy place in the temple. All the priests who were there, consecrated themselves to serve the priestly duties, irrespective of which division they were part of\add*.
\v 12 All the Levites who were singers (Asaf, Heyman, Yedutun, and their sons and their brothers) stood on the east side of the altar. \add They\add* were dressed in fine linen and had cymbals, and harps and lyres, along with 120 priests playing trumpets.
\v 13 The trumpeters and singers performed together to praise and thank Yahweh, with the trumpets and cymbals on the highlights of the song to praise Yahweh:\x + \xo 5:13: \xt 1Ch 16:34; 2Ch 7:3; Ezr 3:11; Psa 100:5; 106:1; 107:1; 118:1; 136:1; Jer 33:11.\x*
\q1 “\add Yahweh\add* is good to us,
\q1 because his loyal commitment continues forever.”
\p Then Yahweh’s temple filled with a cloud
\v 14 and the priests weren’t able to stay on their feet and continue ministering because Yahweh’s brilliance had filled the temple.

\s1 Shelomoh’s blessing
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (1 Kgs 8:12-21)
\p
\v 1 Then Shelomoh \add prayed\add*, “\add Yahweh, you said that you\add* would live in a dark cloud,
\v 2 \add but\add* I’ve built a \add beautiful\add* residence for you—a place for you to live in forever.”
\p
\v 3 \add Then while all the people stood\add* \add there\add*, Shelomoh turned toward them and \add pronounced a blessing over\add* them,
\v 4 saying, “Blessed be Yahweh the god of Yisrael who spoke \add physically\add* to my father David, and \add then caused it to actually happen\add*, when you said \add back then\add*,\x + \xo 6:4-9: \xt 2Sam 7:1-13; 1Ch 17:1-12.\x*
\v 5 ‘From the time that I brought my people out of Egypt, I hadn’t choosen a city from all the tribes of Yisrael as a place to build a house so my name could be there. Nor had I chosen a man to be leader over my people Israel,
\v 6 \add but\add* \add now\add* I’ve chosen Yerushalem \add (Jerusalem)\add* \add to be my place of residence\add* and I’ve chosen \add you\add*, David, to be over my people Yisrael.’
\p
\v 7 “My father David wanted to build a temple for Yisrael’s god Yahweh,
\v 8 \add but\add* Yahweh told \add him\add*, ‘\add It’s good that you wanted to build a house to honour me\add*,
\v 9 \add but\add* you won’t be the one to build it. It’ll be your own \add biological\add* son who’ll build the temple to honour my \add reputation\add*.’
\p
\v 10 “\add Now\add* Yahweh has fulfilled what he said, and I’m here sitting on Yisrael’s throne instead of my father David, just as Yahweh said, and I’ve had this temple built to honour Yisrael’s god Yahweh.
\v 11 I’ve placed the \add sacred\add* chest in there—\add the box\add* that contains the agreement that Yahweh made with Yisrael’s descendants.”

\r (1 Kgs 8:22-53)
\p
\v 12 Then \add Shelomoh\add* stood in front of the altar to Yahweh in front of all the assembled Israelis, and spread out his hands
\v 13 because \add he’d\add* made a bronze platform and had it placed in the centre of the courtyard. The square platform was just over two metres on each side, and stood just over a metre off the ground. \add Firstly\add* he stood on it, then he knelt down onto his knees in front of all the assembled Israelis and spread his hands out to the \add sky\add*
\v 14 and said, “Yahweh, God of Yisrael, there isn’t any god like you in the heavens or on the earth—one who keeps his agreement and \add shows\add* loyal commitment to your servants who are walking \add with total integrity as you watch them\add*.
\v 15 \add Everything you verbally told my father David that you’d do, you’ve used your power to make it all happen, including this today\add*.
\v 16 And now, Yahweh, God of Yisrael, keep \add something else\add* for your servant David my father when you told him, ‘There’ll \add always be one of your descendants sitting on Yisrael’s throne, as long as they obey my instructions just like you have\add*.’\x + \xo 6:16: \xt 1Ki 2:4.\x*
\v 17 \add So\add* now, Yahweh, God of Yisrael, let what you said to your servant, to David, be confirmed.

\v 18 “But will God really live with humans \add here\add* on the earth? Wow, the skies and the heavens of the heavens can’t contain you—how much less this house that I’ve built.\x + \xo 6:18: \xt 2Ch 2:6.\x*

\v 3 and when all the \add Israelis\add* saw the fire come down and saw the \add bright light\add* above the \add temple\add*, they fell \add to their knees with\add* their faces bowed down low to the stone pavement, and worshipped and thanked Yahweh saying, “He is certainly good—his loyal commitment really will \add continue\add* forever.”\x + \xo 7:3: \xt 1Ch 16:34; 2Ch 5:13; Ezr 3:11; Psa 100:5; 106:1; 107:1; 118:1; 136:1; Jer 33:11.\x*
\p
\v 4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices to Yahweh—
\v 5 King Shelomoh sacrificed twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep, and \add so\add* the king and all the people dedicated God’s \add temple\add*.
\v 6 The priests were standing in their positions, as well as the Levites with the instruments that King David had made to give thanks to Yahweh. When \add they assisted\add* David in praising \add Yahweh\add*, \add they would sing\add*, “\add Yes,\add* his loyal commitment \add continues\add* forever,” and the priests \add would blow their trumpets\add* in front of them as all the \add Israelis\add* stood \add there\add*.
\p
\v 7 Then Shelomoh consecrated the middle of the courtyard \add in front\add* of Yahweh’s \add temple building\add* so he could offer burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings there, because the bronze altar that \add he’d\add* made wasn’t able to \add handle\add* the \add large number of\add* burnt offerings and grain offerings, and the fats.
\p
\v 8 Then Shelomoh and all Yisrael feasted for the \add next\add* seven days—the huge gathering spread from Levo-Hamat \add in the far north\add*, all the way to the Egyptian riverbed \add in the far south\add*.
\v 9 On the eighth day, they \add had a solemn service\add*, because they’d observed seven days of celebration for the altar \add with seven days of feasting\add*.
\v 10 \add Finally after some three weeks,\add* \add Shelomoh\add* sent the people \add home\add*—they were cheery and \add encouraged\add* because of the goodness that Yahweh had \add displayed to\add* David and Shelomoh, and for his Israeli people.

\v 11 \add So\add* Shelomoh finished Yahweh’s \add temple\add* and the king’s \add palace\add*—he’d succeeded in \add implementing everything that he’d envisaged\add*.
\v 12 \add One\add* night, Yahweh appeared to Shelomoh in a dream and told him, “I’ve heard your prayer, and I’ve chosen this \add temple to be the place where my people will offer sacrifices\add* \add to me\add*.
\v 13 If I restrain the skies \add so\add* there’s no rain, or if I command locusts to devour the land, or if I send disease among my people,
\v 14 \add then if\add* my people \add who are known by my name\add* humble themselves and pray, and \add request my help\add* and turn back from their evil ways, then I myself will hear \add them\add* from the heavens, and I’ll forgive their sin, and I will heal their land.
\v 15 My eyes will be open and my ears will be attentive to prayers \add offered towards\add* this place,
\v 16 as I’ve chosen and consecrated this \add temple to be associated with my name forever—I’ll be permanently present there\add*.
\v 17 \add Also, if you’ll obey\add* me like your father David did, and do everything that I’ve instructed you, and keep my rules and regulations,
\v 18 then \add I’ll ensure that your descendants rule your kingdom\add*, just as I \add promised\add* your father David when I said, ‘\add You won’t fail to have one of your descendants\add* ruling over Yisrael.’
\v 19 \add However,\add* if you all turn away, and abandon my rules and instructions that I gave you all, and \add decide to\add* serve other gods and worship them,
\v 20 then I’ll remove \add these people\add* from my land that I gave them. \add Also this temple\add* that I consecrated for \add myself\add*, I’ll \add throw it away where I can’t see it\add*, and I’ll make it \add an object of scorn and ridicule\add* among all the \add other\add* nations.
\p
\v 21 Then this \add temple which everyone admires\add* as they pass by, will be devasted and \add people\add* will \add ask\add*, ‘Why did Yahweh do \add such terrible things\add* to that \add temple\add* and to that land?’
\p
\v 22 ‘It happened because they abandoned Yahweh, the god of their ancestors,’ others will reply. ‘He brought them out from \add slavery in\add* Egypt, \add but then\add* they obtained other gods and worshipped them and served them—that’s why he sent them all this misery.’ ”

\s1 King Shelomoh’s achievements
\s4 Full kingdom
\r (1 Kgs 9:10-28)
\p
\v 1 \add After\add* the twenty years that it took Shelomoh to build Yahweh’s \add temple\add* and his \add palace\add*,
\v 2 \add he\add* rebuilt the cities that \add King\add* Huram had given to \add him\add*, and he \add got Israelis to live in them\add*.
\p
\v 3 Then Shelomoh \add attacked\add* Hamat-Tsovah and \add captured it\add*.
\v 4 He \add rebuilt\add* Tadmore in the wilderness, and storage cities in the Hamat \add region\add*.
\v 5 He \add rebuilt\add* the fortified cities of Upper-Beyt-Horon and Lower-Beyt-Horon with walls and barred gates,
\v 6 as well as Baalat and all the storage cities, and all the cities for Shelomoh’s chariots and horsemen that he wanted to build in Yerushalem and Lebanon, and throughout his kingdom.
\v 7 All the people \add who lived in Yisrael but who were actually\add* remnants of the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Yebusites
\v 8 \add who were descendants of groups that the Israelis hadn’t completely destroyed, were forced to become Shelomoh’s labourers and they continue in that role until the present time\add*.
\v 9 \add However,\add* Shelomoh didn’t make the Israelis become labourers, because they became his \add soldiers\add*, officers, chariot commanders, and horsemen.
\v 10 \add Some\add* 250 \add Israelis\add* were \add also\add* King Shelomoh’s \add chief officials\add* who had authority over the people.
\p
\v 11 Shelomoh brought \add his wife\add*, Far-oh’s \add (Pharaoh’s)\add* daughter, up from the city of David to the house that he had built for her, because he said, “My wife mustn’t live in the \add palace\add* of Yisrael’s King David, because the places where Yahweh’s box has been are sacred.”
\p
\v 12 Then Shelomoh sacrificed burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar that had been built in front of the \add temple’s\add* porch.
\v 13 He \add followed Mosheh’s instructions about the daily\add* \add sacrifices\add* for the rest days and the new moons, and for the appointed three times per year: the Celebration of Flat Bread, the Harvest Festival, and the Celebration Living in Shelters.\x + \xo 8:13: a \xt Num 28:9-10; \xo b \xt Num 28:11-15; \xo c \xt Exo 23:14-17; 34:22-23; Num 28:16–29:39; Deu 16:16.\x*
\v 14 Then as his father David had instructed, he assigned the priests into divisions for their various tasks, and the Levites who would praise and minister in front of the priests and help in their daily tasks, and gatekeepers in their divisions at the various gates. That was \add all\add* what David, the man of God had commanded.
\v 15 The priests and Levites followed the king’s instructions concerning all their duties, as well as \add their supervision of\add* the treasuries.
\p
\v 16 \add So now,\add* all of Shelomoh’s work on Yahweh’s \add temple\add* was completed—from the foundation through to it’s completion \add and operation\add*.
\p
\v 17 Then Shelomoh went to Etsyon-Gever and to Eylat on the edge of the ocean, in the Edom \add region\add*.
\v 18 \add King\add* Huram \add (from Tsor/Tyre)\add* sent ships to him \add as his\add* servants who knew the sea \add well\add*. Then Shelomoh’s men \add boarded the ships\add* and sailed with them to Ofir, where they obtained fifteen tonnes of gold and brought \add it back\add* to King Shelomoh.

\s1 The queen from Sheva visits

\r (1 Kgs 10:1-13)
\p
\v 1 The queen from the Sheva \add region\add* had heard \add all about\add* Shelomoh, and she came to Yerushalem with some hard questions. Her party \add included\add* a large number of camels carrying lots of spices and gold and valuable gemstones. She came to Shelomoh and \add discussed\add* everything that was on her mind with him.\x + \xo 9:1-9: \xt Mat 12:42; Luk 11:31.\x*
\v 2 Shelomoh responded to all her \add queries\add*, and there wasn’t any subject that \add he\add* wasn’t able to speak to.
\v 3 When the queen from Sheva saw Shelomoh’s wisdom, and \add saw\add* the \add palace\add* that he’d built
\v 4 and the food at his table, as well as the seating of his servants, his well-dressed ministers standing by, his cup-bearers in their uniforms, and the burnt offerings that he sacrificed at Yahweh’s \add temple\add*, it \add took her breath away\add*
\v 5 and she told the king, “Everything I heard in my \add own\add* country about you and you wisdom was true.
\v 6 I didn’t believe \add what they reported to me until I saw it with my own eyes\add*, and wow, the reports that I heard \add didn’t even cover\add* \em half\em* of the extent of your wisdom!
\v 7 Your men are blessed, and \add even\add* your servants are blessed to be able to continually stand in front of you and listen to your wisdom.
\v 8 Let your god Yahweh be blessed—the one who delighted in you to place you on his throne as \add his\add* king. Your god loved Yisrael \add and wanted\add* to establish them forever, \add so\add* he’s placed you over them as king—to give justice and \add do what is right\add*.”
\p
\v 9 Then she gave the king four tonnes of gold, a very large quantity of spices, and valuable gemstones. \add Nobody before had ever seen\add* such a large amount of spicies as what the queen from Sheva gave to King Shelomoh.
\p
\v 10 (\add Also\add*, \add King\add* Huram’s servants \add working together with\add* Shelomoh’s servants brought gold from Ofir, as well as algum wood and valuable gemstones.
\v 11 The king made the algum wood into staircases for Yahweh’s \add temple\add* and for the king’s \add palace\add*, and into lyres and harps for the singers. Nothing like that had been seen before in Yehudah.)
\p
\v 12 King Shelomoh gave the queen from Sheba \add everything she wanted\add*—more than what she’d brought to the king. Then she \add departed\add* with her servants and went \add back\add* to her country.
\s1 Shelomoh’s wealth

\r (1 Kgs 10:14-25)
\p
\v 13 In one year, Shelomoh received about twenty tonnes of gold,
\v 14 as well as what the merchants and traders brought in. All the Arabian kings, and all the \add local\add* governors brought gold and silver to Shelomoh.
\v 15 King Shelomoh made two hundred large shields of beaten gold—six hundred gold \add coins worth\add* of beaten gold \add went into\add* each shield.
\v 16 \add Also,\add* three hundred \add smaller shields\add*—three hundred gold \add coins worth\add* of beaten gold \add went into\add* each shield.
\p
\v 17 Then the king made a large, ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold.
\v 18 There were six steps \add leading up to\add* the throne, and a gold footstool was attached to \add it\add*. It had armrests on \add each side\add*, with a lion \add statue\add* beside each armrest.
\v 19 There were twelve \add statues of\add* lions standing on the six steps—one at each end of each step. \add No throne\add* like that existed in any other kingdom.
\p
\v 20 All of King Shelomoh’s \add cups\add* were made of gold, and all the \add various dishes\add* in ‘The House of the Lebanon Forest’ were refined gold. Nothing was made of silver, because in the \add time\add* of Shelomoh’s \add reign\add*, silver wasn’t considered valuable
\v 21 because the king’s ships went to Tarshish with Huram’s servants. Every three years the fleet would \add bring back\add* gold, silver, ivory, and apes and baboons,
\v 22 \add so\add* King Shelomoh \add became\add* greater than all the other kings in the world, \add both\add* in wealth and in wisdom.
\p
\v 23 \add Kings from all over the world wanted to come and listen\add* to the wisdom that God had \add given\add* Shelomoh.
\v 24 Each of them would bring gifts: gold and silver items, clothes, myrrh and spieces, horses and mules. (\add This continued\add* \add year after year\add*.)
\p
\v 25 Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, and he kept \add some\add* in the chariot cities and \add some\add* \add close by\add* in Yerushalem.\x + \xo 9:25: \xt 1Ki 4:26.\x*

\v 27 The king made silver \add as common\add* as stones, and cedar \add timber as common\add* as the sycamore fig trees in the lowlands.

\v 29 Everything else that Shelomoh did, from the beginning to the end, was written down by the prophet Natan, and the prophecy by Ahiyah (from Shiloh) and the prophet Iddo’s visions about Nevat’s son Yaraveam \add (Jeroboam)\add* \add were also written down\add*.
\v 30 Shelomoh reigned from Yerushalem over all Yisrael for forty years,

\r (1 Kgs 12:1-20)
\p
\v 1 Then Rehaveam \add (Rehoboam)\add* went to Shekem where all Yisrael had gathered \add for his coronation\add*.
\v 2 \add Meanwhile\add*, Nevat’s son Yaraveam \add (Jeroboam)\add* had fled from King Shelomoh and was \add down\add* in Egypt, \add but\add* when he heard \add about the coming coronation\add*, \add he\add* returned from Egypt.
\v 3 \add So\add* the leaders of the northern tribes summoned \add Yaraveam\add*, and he went with them to speak to \add Shelomoh’s son\add* Rehaveam and all Yisrael, saying,
\v 4 “Your father \add made us work very hard, but\add* now, lighten the \add demands that\add* your father \add made on\add* us, and we’ll serve you.”
\p
\v 5 “Come back to me in three days.” \add Rehaveam\add* \add answered\add*, so the people departed.
\p
\v 6 Then King Rehaveam consulted with the older men who’d advised his father Shelomoh when he was \add still\add* alive, \add asking\add* \add them\add*, “How do you all advise me to answer the people?”
\p
\v 7 “If you are good to those people and \add do things that please them\add*, and speak \add kindly\add* to them,” they \add answered\add*, “then they’ll \add serve you for a long time to come\add*.”
\p
\v 8 \add However,\add* \add Rehaveam\add* \add rejected their advice\add*, and consulted some of the young men \add there\add* who’d grown up with him.
\v 9 “\add How would you guys suggest that I answer the people who’ve asked me to lighten the burden on them from the days of my father\add*?”
\p
\v 10 “\add Those people tell you that your father was hard on them and that you should lighten their load\add*,” \add his contemporaries advised him\add*. “\add But you should tell that that your little finger is thicker than your father’s waist\add*,
\v 11 \add and that whereas he required them to contribute, you’ll be even more demanding. Tell them that he might\add* have whipped you with \add leather\add* whips, but that you’ll whip them with scorpions!”
\p
\v 12 \add So\add* Yaraveam and all the people \add returned\add* to \add King\add* Rehaveam on the third day \add as he’d prearranged\add*,
\v 13 and ignoring the advice of the older men, the king answered \add the people\add* harshly.
\v 14 \add He passed on the suggestion\add* of the younger men, telling \add the people\add*, “I’ll make your \add burden even heavier\add*. My father rebuked you all with whips, but I’ll \add do it\add* with scorpions.”
\v 15 \add So\add* the king \add took no notice of the people’s request\add*, because \add it was God turning events around so that what Yahweh had said to Yaraveam (Nevat’s son) through Ahiyah (from Shiloh), would come to pass\add*.
\p
\v 16 \add When\add* all \add the Israelis\add* saw that the king hadn’t listened to them, and the people \add from the northern tribes\add* answered the king, “What \add did David have to do with us anyway\add*? \add We had nothing to gain\add* from Yeshay’s \add (Jesse’s)\add* son. \add You might as well all head home, and then they’ll see what happened to David’s dynasty\add*.”
\p \add So they all went home\add*\x + \xo 10:16: \xt 2Sam 20:1.\x*
\v 17 and Rehaveam \add ended up\add* \add only ruling over the Israelis living in the Yehudah region\add*.
\p
\v 18 King Rehaveam \add (still in Shekem)\add* sent out Hadoram, his supervisor of the forced labourers, but the \add Israelis hurled stones at him and killed him\add*. \add When he heard about that\add*, King Rehoboam \add forced his way into his\add* chariot \add and escaped\add* to Yerushalem,

\v 13 The priests and Levites throughout all Yisrael \add supported Rehaveam from every part of the country\add*.
\v 14 The Levites abandoned their property and their pastureland and moved to Yerushalem and across the rest of Yehudah, because Yaraveam and his sons rejected them from serving as priests to Yahweh.

\v 16 \add As well as\add* \add the priests and Levites\add*, people from all the Israeli tribes \add who wanted to serve\add* Yisrael’s god Yahweh, came to Yerushalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the god of their ancestors.

\v 1 \add However,\add* after Rehaveam \add (Rehoboam)\add* \add had become established and in firm control of his\add* kingdom, he \add and all the people\add* abandoned Yahweh’s instructions.
\v 2 Because they were unfaithful to Yahweh, King Shishak from Egypt \add (Heb. Mitsrayim)\add* came \add to attack\add* Yerushalem in the fifth year of Rehaveam’s \add reign\add*
\v 3 with 1,200 chariots and sixty thousand horsemen, along with a huge number of troops including Egyptians, Libyans, Sukkites, and Kushites.
\v 4 He captured Yehudah’s fortified cities, then moved towards Yerushalem.
\p
\v 5 Then the prophet Shemayah and the leaders of Yehudah who had \add fled\add* to Yerushalem because of Shishak’s \add attacks\add* came to Rehaveam. \add Shemayah\add* told them, “Yahweh says that it was all of you who abandoned me, \add so\add* then I’ve also abandoned you all \add to be defeated by\add* Shishak.”
\p
\v 6 Then the king and the Israeli leaders humbled themselves and said, “Yahweh \add always does what is right and fair\add*.”
\p
\v 7 When Yahweh saw that they’d humbled themselves, \add he gave this\add* message to Shemayah, “They’ve humbled themselves \add so\add* I won’t destroy them—my rage won’t pour out on Yerushalem \add using Shishak’s attack\add*, and I’ll give them \add a way to recover\add* \add in the future\add*.
\v 8 \add Nevertheless,\add* they’ll become his servants, and they’ll \add learn\add* \add the difference between\add* \add serving me versus serving the kings of other nations\add*.
\p
\v 9 \add When\add* Egypt’s King Shishak \add invaded\add* Yerushalem, he took the treasures from Yahweh’s \add temple\add* and the king’s \add palace\add*.

\v 14 \add Rehaveam\add* did evil \add things\add* because he didn’t \add make it his priority to get direction from\add* Yahweh.

\v 15 The \add account of everything that Rehaveam did while he was king, including genealogical records, was recorded in the scrolls\add* written by the prophets Shemayah and Iddo. Rehaveam and Yaraveam \add were at war with each other for his entire reign\add*.

\v 7 and \add a bunch of wicked good-for-nothings\add* gathered around \add Yaraveam\add* and \add created a force\add* against Shelomoh’s son, Rehaveam, when Rehaveam was \add still an inexperienced, young man and couldn’t stand up to\add* them.
\v 8 \add So\add* now you’re all saying that you’ll \add stand against\add* the kingdom \add that Yahweh established through\add* David’s descendants. \add There are certainly many of you, and you have\add* the gold calves that Yaraveam made as gods for you all.
\v 9 Didn’t you all drive out the Levites, as well as Yahweh’s priests who were Aharon’s descendants? Then you all \add appointed\add* for yourselves ‘priests’ like they have in \add other\add* countries, so that anyone who comes to consecrate himself by bringing a young bull from the herd and seven rams can become a ‘priest’ of your non-gods.
\p
\v 10 “\add But\add* as for us, Yahweh is our God and we haven’t abandoned him. Our priests who minister to Yahweh are Aharon’s descendants, and the Levites \add assist them\add*.
\v 11 \add Every morning and every evening\add*, they sacrifice burnt offerings to Yahweh, and spiced incense. There’s \add sacred\add* bread on the \add display\add* table, and the lamps in the gold lampstand give light every evening because we are following the instructions of our God Yahweh, \add but\add* you all have abandoned him.
\v 12 \add So listen!\add* God is \add guiding us\add* and his priests will blast their trumpets to sound against you all. \add Listen\add* you Israelis: don’t fight against Yahweh, the god of your ancestors, because you won’t succeed.”
\p
\v 13 \add But meanwhile,\add* Yaraveam had \add sent\add* \add some men\add* around to ambush them from behind, so they were \add both\add* in front of \add the army from\add* Yehudah and in ambush behind them.
\p
\v 14 When \add the warriors from\add* Yehudah turned, wow, \add they realised that they were being attacked from in front and from\add* behind. They \add called\add* out to Yahweh \add for help\add* \add while\add* the priests blew their trumpets.
\v 15 Then the men from Yehudah \add shouted a loud battle cry\add* and God defeated Yaraveam and all Yisrael \add in front of\add* Aviyah and Yehudah.
\v 16 Yisrael’s \add soldiers\add* fled away from Yehudah’s \add army\add*, and God \add enabled Yehudah to defeat them\add*.
\v 17 Aviyah and his \add men thrashed them badly\add*, and \add some\add* five-hundred thousand of their chosen \add warriors were killed\add*.
\v 18 \add So\add* the Israelis were subdued at that time, and the people from Yehudah were victorious because they \add trusted in\add* Yahweh, the god of their ancestors.
\p
\v 19 Aviyah chased after Yaraveam and they captured the cities of Beyt-El, Yeshanah, and Efron and the surrounding villages from \add Yisrael\add*.
\v 20 Yaraveam \add never regained military strength\add* during Aviyah’s \add reign\add*, and \add after a time\add* Yahweh struck him \add with sickness\add* and he died.
\p
\v 21 \add Meanwhile,\add* Aviyah \add became more powerful\add*. He took fourteen wives for himself, and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
\v 22 The rest of \add what Aviyah did, including his sayings and his behaviour, was written down by\add* the prophet Iddo.

\v 1 Then Aviyah \add died\add* and they buried him with his ancestors in ‘The city of David’, and his son Asa, reigned in his place. \add During his rule,\add* the \add country was peaceful for\add* ten years.
\v 2 Asa did what was good and right in the eyes of his god Yahweh—
\v 3 he removed the \add pagan\add* altars and the \add hilltop shrines\add*, \add smashed\add* the sacred \add stone\add* pillars, and cut the Asherah poles down.
\v 4 He \add ordered\add* \add the people in\add* Yehudah to \add worship\add* Yahweh, the god of their ancestors, and to obey his instructions and regulations.
\v 5 He removed all the hilltop shrines from Yehudah’s cities and the incense altars, and the kingdom \add was peaceful under his rule\add*.
\v 6 He fortified Yehudah’s cities as the place was quiet without war during those years, because Yahweh had given him \add peace\add*
\v 7 and he’d told Yehudah, “Let’s build these cities and \add with walls around them\add*, and towers, doors, and bars \add while\add* the land is quiet \add around\add* us because we’ve \add asked\add* our god Yahweh \add for guidance\add*. We’ve \add made our request\add* and he’sgiven rest to us all around.” \add So\add* they built and they \add prospered\add*.
\v 8 \add King\add* Asa had an army of three-hundred thousand men from Yehudah who carried large shields and spears, as well as 280,000 men from Benyamin who also carried shields along with bows and arrows. They were all \add powerful warriors\add*.

\v 9 \add But then\add* Zerah the Kushite \add (or Ethiopian)\add* came out against them with an army of a million \add soldiers\add* and three hundred chariots, and he \add advanced\add* to Mareshah.
\v 10 Asa went out to \add oppose\add* them, and they deployed for battle in the Tsefatah valley near Mareshah.
\v 11 Then \add King\add* Asa called out to his god Yahweh, “Yahweh, it \add makes no difference to you if there’s one against you, or one million\add*. Help us, Yahweh our god, because we rely on you, and we’ve come against this \add massive force trusting in your reputation\add*. Yahweh, you’re our god—don’t let \add mere humans\add* prevail against you.”
\p
\v 12 \add So\add* Yahweh \add helped Asa and the army from Yehudah to defeat\add* the Cushites, and \add they\add* fled.
\v 13 Asa and his army chased them \add southwest\add* as far as Gerar. \add So many\add* Kushites \add were killed\add* that \add the rest\add* \add couldn’t save themselves\add*, because they had been \add destroyed in front\add* of Yahweh and his \add army\add*, and the \add men of Yehudah\add* carried away a large amount of plunder.
\v 14 They struck all the cities around Gerar, because \add the Kushites there were terrified of Yahweh\add*. The \add men from Yehudah\add* plundered all those cities, because they \add contained a lot of valuable goods\add*.
\v 15 They also attacked the \add Kushite\add* cattle \add herdsmen\add*, as well as capturing lots of sheep and camels \add before returning\add* to Yerushalem.

\s1 Azaryah’s prophecy gives courage to Asa
\s4 Southern kingdom
\p
\v 1 Then God’s spirit came on Oded’s son Azaryah,
\v 2 and he went out to \add King\add* Asa and told him, “Listen to me, Asa, and all Yehudah and Benyamin: Yahweh is with you all, when you’re all with him. And if you all look for him, he’ll be found by you all, but if you abandon him, he’ll \add also\add* abandon you all.
\v 3 Yisrael has been without the true God \add for a long time\add* as there hasn’t been a priest teaching, so \add God’s\add* instructions \add have been forgotten\add*.
\v 4 \add However,\add* they turned to Yisrael’s god Yahweh when they were in distress, and \add requested his help\add* and he \add helped\add* them.
\p
\v 5 “In those times, it wasn’t \add safe to travel away\add* because there was \add wide unrest among\add* the inhabitants of the \add surrounding\add* \add regions\add*.
\v 6 Nation crushed nation, and city \add crushed\add* city, because God \add sent them\add* \add one trouble after another\add*.
\v 7 But all of you, be strong and don’t give up \add striving\add*, because your \add hard\add* work will be rewarded.”
\p
\v 8 When \add King\add* Asa heard those words and the prophecy from the prophet Oded’s \add son\add*, he \add took courage\add* and removed all the detestable \add idols\add* from across Yehudah and Benyamin, and from the cities that he’d captured from the Efrayim hill country. \add Also,\add* he repaired the altar to Yahweh that \add stood\add* in front of Yahweh’s temple.
\p
\v 9 He assembled all \add the people from\add* Yehudah and Benyamin, as well as the many people who had joined them from \add the tribes of\add* Efrayim, Menashsheh, and Shimeon. (Many people had emmigrated from Yisrael \add into Yehudah\add* when they had realised that his God Yahweh was \add helping\add* him.)
\v 10 They gathered \add together\add* in Yerushalem in \add June\add* of the fifteenth year of \add King\add* Asa’s reign
\v 11 and sacrificed seven hundred bulls to Yahweh and seven thousand sheep—\add all of which had come\add* from the \add recent\add* plunder.
\v 12 They \add solemnly\add* \add agreed to sincerely and diligently devote themselves to\add* Yahweh, the god of their ancestors.
\v 13 \add They decided\add* that anyone who didn’t \add worship\add* Yisrael’s god Yahweh \add must be killed, man or woman, and whether or not they had an important position\add*.
\v 14 They \add loudly promised\add* that together to Yahweh, then shouted and blew trumpets and horns,
\v 15 and all Yehudah \add celebrated that promise because they were totally sincere and committed. They asked Yahweh to give them guidance which he did, and he enabled them to have peace throughout their country\add*.
\p
\v 16 King Asa also removed his mother Maakah from \add her position as\add* queen because she made a disguisting Asherah \add pole\add*. Asa cut down \add the pole\add* and crushed it, and burnt it at the Kidron brook,
\v 17 \add although\add* they didn’t remove the hilltop shrines from Yisrael. \add Nevertheless,\add* Asa \add maintained his singular devotion\add* \add to Yahweh\add* \add all his lifetime\add*,
\v 18 and he brought his father’s sacred things, and his own, into God’s \add temple\add* house of God—gold and silver items.
\v 19 There was no more war \add in Yehudah\add* until the thirty-fifth year of Asa’s reign.

\s1 Yisrael comes to invade Yehudah

\r (1 Kgs 15:17-22)
\p
\v 1 In the thirty-sixth year of \add King\add* Asa’s reign, Yisrael’s king Baasha \add invaded\add* Yehudah and built Ramah to \add prevent anyone from leaving or entering the land of\add* Yehudah’s King Asa.
\v 2 Asa took gold and silver from the \add temple\add* treasuries and the king’s \add palace\add*, and he sent \add it\add* to King Ben-Hadad of Aram \add (modern Syria)\add*, who lived in Damascus, \add requesting\add*,
\v 3 “\add I want\add* a \add peace treaty\add* between you and me, and between your \add family\add* and \add mine\add*. Listen, I’ve sent gold and silver to you. Go \add and\add* break your agreement with Yisrael’s King Baasha, \add so\add* he’ll \add give up on his attack\add* against me.”
\p
\v 4 Ben-Hadad \add accepted\add* King Asa’s \add suggestion\add* and sent his army captains \add to fight\add* against Yisrael’s cities. They struck Iyyon, Dan, and Abel-Mayim, and all the storehouses in the Naftali cities.
\v 5 \add When\add* \add King\add* Baasha heard \add about that\add*, he stopped \add fortifying\add* Ramah and \add abandoned the project\add*,
\v 6 \add so\add* King Asa took \add men there\add* from Yehudah. They carried away all the \add building\add* stones from Ramah, along with the timber which Baasha had been using, and used \add it all\add* to build Geva and Mitspah \add (north of Yerushalem)\add*.
\s1 Hanani’s prophecy about coming wars
\s4 Southern kingdom
\p
\v 7 At that time, the prophet Hanani went to Yehudah’s King Asa, and told him, “Because you relied on the king from Aram \add rather than\add* on your god Yahweh, therefore the Aramean king’s army has escaped from \add being defeated by you\add*.
\v 8 Weren’t the Kushites and the Libyans \add overwhelming in number\add* with chariots and horsemen, yet because you relied on Yahweh, he \add helped you defeat them\add*,
\v 9 because Yahweh \add sees everything that’s happening all over the world, and he strengthens those who trust him completely\add*. You’ve been foolish \add in what you’ve just done\add*, so from now on, you’ll \add be facing\add* wars.”
\v 10 \add But\add* \add King\add* Asa was angry at the prophet, very angry, and had him put in \add prison\add*, and \add after that\add* Asa oppressed some of \add his\add* people.

\v 2 He placed \add troops\add* in all of Yehudah’s fortified cities, and posted garrisons across Yehudah and in the cities in Efrayim that his father Asa had captured.
\v 3 Yahweh \add helped\add* Yehoshafat because he followed his ancestor David’s ways at the beginning, and didn’t \add ask the Baals for guidance\add*,
\v 4 because he \add asked\add* his father’s god, and he \add followed God’s instructions rather than doing the evil things done in\add* Yisrael.
\v 5 \add So\add* Yahweh \add enabled him to maintain control of his\add* kingdom, and the Yehudah brought tribute to Yehoshafat, \add causing him to become very wealthy and highly respected\add*.
\v 6 \add He was completely devoted to doing what pleased\add* Yahweh, even removing the \add hilltop shrines\add* and the Asherah \add poles\add* from Yehudah.
\p
\v 7 In the third year of his reign he sent his \add officials\add*, Ben-Hayil, Ovadyah, Zekaryah, Netanel, and Mikayah, to teach in Yehudah’s cities.
\v 8 They were accompanied by the Levites Shemayah, Netanyah, Zevadyah, Asahel, Shemiramot, Yehonatan, Adoniyah, Toviyah, and Tov-Adoniyah, along with two priests Elishama and Yehoram.

\v 1 \add King\add* Yehoshafat \add became very wealthy and was highly honoured\add*, \add but then\add* he allied himself by marriage to \add Yisrael’s King\add* Ahav.
\v 2 \add Some years later,\add* he went \add up\add* to Ahav in Shomron \add (Samaria)\add*, and Ahab sacrificed lots of sheep and cattle for him and for the people who were with him, and he incited him to \add attack\add* Ramot-Gilead—
\v 3 Yisrael’s King Ahav \add suggested to\add* Yehudah’s King Yehoshafat, “Will you \add join\add* me to \add attack\add* Ramot-Gilead?”
\p “\add Wherever you’ll be, I’ll be there\add*,” he \add responded\add*. “Your people \add are like my own\add* people, and \add we’re\add* with you in battle.”
\v 4 \add Then he added\add*, “\add But we should get Yahweh’s advice first\add*.”
\p
\v 5 \add So\add* Yisrael’s king gathered four hundred \add of his\add* prophets and \add asked\add* them, “Should we \add attack\add* Ramot-Gilead or not?”
\p “Go \add ahead\add*,” they answered, “and God will give \add victory to\add* the king.”
\p
\v 6 \add But\add* Yehoshafat \add asked\add*, “Is there no prophet of Yahweh here that we can \add ask\add*?”
\p
\v 7 The king of Yisrael told Yehoshafat, “\add There’s\add* still one man \add who would ask\add* Yahweh, \add but\add* I myself hate him because \add he never prophesies anything good\add* about me—\add it’s always something\add* evil. He’s Yimlah’s son, Mikayah.”
\p “\add You shouldn’t talk like that\add*,” said Yehoshafat.
\p
\v 8 \add So\add* Yisrael’s king \add ordered\add* an official, “\add Get\add* Yimlah’s son, Mikayah \add here\add* \add as quick as possible\add*.”
\p
\v 9 \add Now\add* the kings of Yisrael and Yehudah were \add both\add* clothed in their \add royal\add* robes and sitting there on their thrones near Shomron’s \add (Samaria’s)\add* entrance gate. They were \add up\add* on a threshing floor, and all the prophets were prophesying \add in front of\add* them.
\v 10 Kenaanah’s son Tsedkiyah made himself some iron horns and said, “Yahweh says that you’ll gore Aram with these until they’re destroyed.”
\v 11 All the rest of Ahav’s prophets agreed, saying, “\add Yes,\add* go and attack Ramot-Gilead and you’ll succeed—Yahweh will give the king \add victory\add*.”
\p
\v 12 The messenger who went to fetch Mikayah \add warned\add* him, “Listen, the king \add is pleased with what the other prophets agreed on. Just say the same as them and give a favourable message\add*.”
\p
\v 13 \add But\add* Mikayah \add responded\add*, “As sure as Yahweh lives, I’ll only say what my god tells me to say.”
\p
\v 14 \add When he got\add* to the king, King \add Ahav\add* \add asked\add* him, “Mikayah, should we \add attack\add* Ramot-Gilead for battle, or should I \add hold back\add*?”
\p “Go \add ahead\add* and succeed,” he \add answered\add*. “\add You’ll be given victory over them\add*.”
\p
\v 15 \add But\add* the king said to him, “How many times must I keeping making you promise that you’ll \add only say what Yahweh says—not just what I want to hear\add*?”
\v 16 \add So\add* \add Mikayah\add* \add responded\add*, “I saw all Yisrael scattered on the hills like sheep without shepherds, and Yahweh said, ‘\add They don’t have any master, so they’ll all just go home\add* in peace.’ ”\x + \xo 18:16: \xt Num 27:17; Eze 34:5; Mat 9:36; Mrk 6:34.\x*
\p
\v 17 \add Ahav remarked\add* to Yehoshafat, “Didn’t I tell you that he wouldn’t prophesy anything good about me—only \add disaster\add*?”
\p
\v 18 \add But\add* \add Mikayah\add* \add continued\add*, “\add Well, listen to what Yahweh says\add*. I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne and all the \add heavenly soldiers\add* standing on \add each side of him\add*,
\v 19 and Yahweh said, ‘Who’ll entice Yisrael’s King Ahab so he’ll \add attack\add* and then he’ll fall at Ramot-Gilead?’ \add Some suggested one thing, and others suggested something else\add*.
\v 20 Then \add a\add* spirit went out, and stood \add in front of\add* Yahweh and said, ‘I myself will entice him.’ ‘\add How would you do it\add*?’ Yahweh \add asked\add* him.
\v 21 \add The spirit\add* \add replied\add*, ‘I’ll go and \add inspire all Ahav’s prophets to tell lies\add*.’ Yahweh said, ‘\add That’ll work\add*. Go and do it.’
\p
\v 22 “\add So\add* now, listen. Yahweh placed a deceiving spirit in the mouth of those prophets of yorus, and Yahweh \add has decreed that you’ll face\add* disaster.”
\p
\v 23 Then Kenaanah’s son Tsedkiyah \add went up to\add* Mikayah \add and slapped him hard\add* on the cheek, saying, “\add Yeah!\add* \add Since when did Yahweh’s spirit leave me and start speaking to\add* you?”
\p
\v 24 “Well, you’ll find out \add soon\add*,” answered Mikayah, “on the day when you go room by room \add in some house\add* to \add try to hide\add*.”
\p
\v 25 “\add Arrest\add* Mikayah,” \add ordered King Ahav\add*, “and return him to Amon the city \add governor\add*, and to \add my\add* son Yoash.
\v 26 \add Tell them that the king’s ordered that this man be put in prison, and be given only strictly-rationed bread and water until I return safely\add*.”

\v 7 \add So revere Yahweh and judge cases carefully, because our god Yahweh doesn’t tolerate injustice, partiality, or bribery\add*.”

\v 3 Yehoshafat \add was alarmed and decided to request advice from\add* Yahweh, and he \add ordered that all Yehudah should fast\add*.
\v 4 \add So\add* Yehudah assembled to \add request Yahweh’s help\add*—they came to Yerushalem from all of Yehudah’s cities to \add ask Yahweh for help\add*.
\p
\v 5 Yehoshafat stood in front of all the people from Yerushalem and across Yehudah, in front of the new temple courtyard
\v 6 and \add prayed\add*, “Yahweh, the god of our ancestors, aren’t you the god \add who lives\add* in the heavens? And you rule in all the kingdoms \add around the world\add*, and \add you have full power and control\add*—no one can stand against you.
\v 7 Weren’t you our god who drove the previous inhabitants of this land out ahead of your Israeli people? Didn’t you give it to the descendants of Abraham—the one you loved forever?\x + \xo 20:7: \xt Isa 41:8; Jam 2:23.\x*
\v 8 \add Our ancestors\add* lived in \add this land\add* and they built a \add temple to honour you\add*, saying,
\v 9 ‘If disaster \add like\add* \add war\add*, judgment, or epidemic, or famine comes on us, we’ll stand \add in front of\add* this \add temple\add*, and \add in front of\add* you, because your name is \add honoured here\add*. And we will cry to you from our distress, and you will hear and deliver.’
\p
\v 10 You didn’t allow our Israeli ancestors to enter the countries of Ammon, Moab, or Edom when they were travelling from Egypt \add to Canaan\add*. So our ancestors turned away from those areas and didn’t destroy them, but now they \add are coming here to attack us\add*.\x + \xo 20:10: \xt Deu 2:4-19.\x*
\v 11 Look how they’re repaying us \add for not destroying them\add*—they come \add here\add* to drive us out from the \add land\add* that you gave us as an inheritance.
\v 12 \add So,\add* our god, \add please punish\add* them, because \add we’re not strong enough to battle this huge army that’s on its way\add*. \add We simply don’t know what to do, so we’re looking to you to rescue us\add*.”
\p
\v 13 \add At that time,\add* all of Yehudah (men, women, and children) were standing \add in front of\add* Yahweh
\v 14 and Yahweh’s spirit came on Yahaziel. (Yahaziel was the son of Zekaryah, son of Benayah, son of Yeiel, son of Mattanyah the Levite and a descendant of Asaf.) In the middle of the assembly
\v 15 he said, “\add Pay\add* attention, all Yehudah and inhabitants of Yerushalem and King Yehoshafat. Yahweh has this to say to you all, ‘Don’t be afraid, and don’t be dismayed by this \add huge force\add*, because it’s not your battle but God’s.\x + \xo 20:15-17: \xt Deu 20:1-4.\x*
\v 16 Tomorrow, go down against them. Listen, they’re coming uphill near the Ascent of Tsits, and you’ll all find them at the end of the valley, facing the Yeruel wilderness.
\v 17 You all won’t \add need\add* to fight \add them\add*—\add Just take your positions all of you from Yerushalem and wider Yehudah, and watch Yahweh save you\add*. Don’t \add be afraid or discouraged\add*. Go out \add there\add* tomorrow and Yahweh will be with you all.’ ”\x + \xo 20:17: \xt Exo 14:13-14.\x*
\p
\v 18 Then \add King\add* Yehoshafat bowed with his face to the ground, and all \add the people from\add* Yerushalem and across Yehudah fell \add to their knees\add* in front of Yahweh to worship \add him\add*.
\v 19 Then \add some of\add* the Levites who were descendants of Kohat and Korah, stood up to \add loudly\add* praise Yisrael’s god Yahweh.
\p
\v 20 They rose early the \add next\add* morning and went out to the Tekoa wilderness, and \add as they were leaving\add* Yehoshafat stood and \add called out\add*, “Hear me, inhabitants of Yerushalem and Yehudah. Believe in \add our\add* god Yahweh, and be \add confident\add*. Believe his prophets and succeed.”
\v 21 Then he consulted with the people, and he appointed some to sing to Yahweh and some to praise \add him for his splendour and sinlessness\add* as they went out before the \add enemy\add* army, and they were saying, “Give thanks to Yahweh, because his loyal commitment \add endures\add* forever.”
\p
\v 22 As they began to sing and praise Yahweh, he sent ambushers against the \add Ammonites, Moabites, and Edomites\add* who were attacking Yehudah, and they were defeated.
\v 23 Then the \add Ammonites and Moabites turned on the Edomites and completely annihilated them\add*, and \add after that\add* they \add slaughtered each other\add*.
\v 24 \add When the men of Yehudah arrived at the place overlooking the wilderness, wow, they saw corpses all over the ground\add*. No one had escaped.
\p
\v 25 Then Yehoshafat and his people went to plunder the spoils, and they found lots of goods among them, as well as clothing,\f + \fr 20:25 \ft The Hebrew ‘bodies/corpses’ seems wrong here.\f* and valuable items. They took that for themselves \add until there was nothing left to\add* carry away—there was \add so much plunder that it took three days to collect it all\add*.
\v 26 On the fourth day, they assembled in the Berakah valley and they praised Yahweh there. That’s why it’s called Berakah valley \add (which means ‘praise/blessing’)\add* to this day.
\v 27 Then all the men from Yerushalem and \add across\add* Yehudah returned to Yerushalem with \add King\add* Yehoshafat \add leading them\add*—celebrating because Yahweh had enabled them to defeat their enemies.
\v 28 \add When\add* they arrived at Yerushalem, they went to the \add temple\add*, \add playing\add* harps, lutes, and trumpets.
\v 29 The nearby kingdoms \add were all very afraid of\add* God when they heard that Yahweh had fought with Yisrael’s enemies,
\v 30 \add so\add* Yehoshafat’s kingdom was untroubled and his god gave him \add peace from all his neighbours\add*.

\r (1 Kgs 22:41-50)
\p
\v 31 Yehoshafat was thirty-five \add years old\add* when he became king, and he reigned over Yehudah from Yerushalem for twenty-five years. His mother was Shilhi’s daughter, Azuvah.
\v 32 He \add had similar priorities to his father Asa, doing what pleased\add* Yahweh, and he didn’t \add deviate\add* from that.
\v 33 \add However,\add* he never removed the hilltop shrines, and the people \add were not really serious about obeying the god of their ancestors\add*.
\p
\v 34 \add Everything else that Yehoshafat did from the beginning to the end\add* \add of his reign\add* was written down by Hanani’s son Yehu in the scroll about Yisrael’s kings.
\p
\v 35 \add Later on,\add* Yehudah’s King Yehoshafat \add made an alliance\add* with Yisrael’s King Ahazyah (which was a wicked thing to do),
\v 36 and they worked together to make ships at Etsyon-Gever to sail to Tarshish.
\v 37 Then Dodavahu’s son Eliezer from Mareshah prophesied against Yehoshafat, saying, “When you allied yourself with Ahazyah, Yahweh broke through your works.” \add In due course,\add* the ships were damaged and unable to \add sail\add* to Tarshish.
\c 21
\p
\v 1 Then Yehoshafat \add died and was buried with his ancestors\add* in ‘The City of David’, and his son Yehoram \add (Jehoram)\add* \add replaced him as king\add*.

\r (2 Kgs 8:17-24)
\p
\v 2 \add Yehoram’s\add* \add younger\add* brothers were Azaryah, Yehiel, Zekaryah, Azaryah, Mikael, and Shefatyah,
\v 3 and their father gave them many gifts of gold and silver and precious things, along with fortified cities in Yehudah, \add however\add* he \add handed\add* the kingdom over to Yehoram because he was the oldest \add son\add*.
\v 4 \add After Yehoram established firm control\add* of his father’s kingdom, he had all his brothers killed, as well as some of Yisrael’s leaders.
\p
\v 5 Yehoram was thirty-two \add years old\add* when he became the king, and he ruled from Yerushalem for eight years.
\v 6 He did \add many of the evil things\add* that Yisrael’s kings had done, because \add he married one\add* of \add King\add* Ahav’s daughters and did things that Yahweh \add had said\add* were evil.
\v 7 \add Despite that,\add* Yahweh wouldn’t \add elminate\add* David’s descendants because of the \add promise he’d made\add* with David to ‘keep his lamp burning’ forever.\x + \xo 21:7: \xt 1Ki 11:36.\x*
\p
\v 8 \add Meanwhile, Edom had been\add* under Yehudah’s control, but \add during Yehoram’s reign\add* they rebelled and \add appointed their own\add* king.\x + \xo 21:8: \xt Gen 27:40.\x*
\v 9 Yehoram took his commanders and all his chariots, and crossed \add the Yorden River\add*, then \add at nighttime\add* he attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and his chariots.\f + \fr 21:9 \ft The meaning of the second half of this sentence is confusing, so other translations might differ.\f*
\v 10 \add However,\add* Edom \add successfully\add* rebelled against \add control by\add* Yehudah, then Livnah \add also did the same\add*, because \add Yehoram\add* had abandoned Yahweh, the god of his ancestors.
\v 11 Also he built hilltop shrines around Yehudah, and he caused Yerushalem’s inhabitants to prostitute themselves,\f + \fr 21:11 \ft This sentence is about worship, not physical adultery, so the reference to prostitution most likely refers to idol worship. Also see verse 13 below.\f* and he drove Yehudah away \add from Yahweh\add*.
\p
\v 12 Then \add King Yehoram\add* received a written message from the prophet Eliyah \add (Elijah)\add*: “Your father David’s god Yahweh says that because you \add decided\add* not to \add follow\add* the ways of your father Yehoshafat or those of \add good\add* King Asa,
\v 13 but rather you \add imitated the behaviour of\add* Yisrael’s king, then \add you’ve caused\add* Yerushalem’s inhabits as well as \add wider\add* Yehudah to commit adultery like Ahab’s \add family did\add*. Also, you’ve killed \add your own blood brothers\add*—people who were better than you.
\v 14 \add So listen, now\add* Yahweh is going to severely strike your people including your sons and your wives, as well as all your possessions,
\v 15 and you yourself will \add get an intestinal disease that will get worse every day until your innids\add* fall out.”
\p
\v 16 Then Yahweh stirred the Philistines up against Yehoram, as well as the Arabs who \add lived beside\add* the Kushites,
\v 17 and they attacked Yehudah. They \add did a lot of damage\add* and took away everything valuable from the king’s palace. They also took his wives and sons, other than Yehoahaz, his youngest son.
\p
\v 18 After that, Yahweh caused an intestinal disease in Yehoram that couldn’t be cured,
\v 19 and it \add progressed day after day until after two years, his intestines fell out and he died in great pain\add*. His people didn’t make a \add bonfire in his honour\add* like they’d done for his ancestors.
\p
\v 20 \add Yehoram\add* was thirty-two when he became king, and he ruled from Yerushalem for eight years. No one regretted it when he died, and his body was buried in ‘The City of David’, but not in the \add royal tombs\add*.

\v 1 The inhabitants of Yerushalem made his youngest son Ahazyah\f + \fr 22:1 \ft Called Yehoahaz in 21:17 above. (Replace ‘Yeho’ at the front with ‘Yah’ at the end—the meaning ‘Yahweh has held’ remains the same.)\f* king in his place, because all \add his older brothers had been killed by the Arab invaders\add*. \add So\add* Yehoram’s son Ahazyah reigned as Yehudah’s king.
\v 2 \add He\add* was twenty-two\f + \fr 22:2 \ft The Hebrew has forty-two here, but we’ve corrected it from 2 Kgs 8:26.\f* when he became king, and he reigned from Yerushalem for one year. His mother was Atalyah, a \add granddaughter\add* of Yisrael’s \add King\add* Omri.
\v 3 \add King Ahazyah\add* \add behaved just like\add* \add King\add* Ahav’s family had done because his mother \add gave him evil advice\add*,
\v 4 \add so\add* he did \add what Yahweh had said was evil\add* just like Ahav’s family, because after his father’s death, they had become \add Ahazyah’s\add* advisors, \add giving destructive suggestions\add*.
\v 5 He \add followed their advice and joined\add* \add King\add* Yehoram (son of Yisrael’s King Ahav) to fight against Aram’s King Hazael at Ramot-Gilead, where Yehoram was wounded by the Arameans.
\v 6 Yehoram returned to Yizreel to recover because he’d been wounded at Ramah in the battle against Aram’s King Hazael. So Yehudah’s King Ahazyah went \add up\add* to Yizreel to see Yehoram.
\p
\v 7 God \add caused Ahazyah’s downfall through\add* his visit to Yehoram. When \add Ahaziah\add* arrived, he went with Yehoram to meet Nimshi’s son Yehu, who Yahweh had appointed to kill all of Ahav’s descendants.
\v 8 \add While Yehu was executing judgement on Ahav’s descendants\add*, he discovered Yehudah’s officials there, including Ahazyah’s nephews who’d been serving him, and he killed them \add all as well\add*.
\v 9 Then Yehu went searching for Ahazyah and found him hiding in Shomrom \add (Samaria) city\add*. They captured him and took him to Yehu, and killed him. They did bury him, because they said, “He was \add the grandson\add* of \add King\add* Yehoshafat who \add tried hard to please\add* Yahweh.” \add After that,\add* there were no \add descendants of Ahazyah who were powerful enough to become Yehudah’s king\add*.

\v 11 \add However, a princess named\add* Yehoshaveat took Ahazyah’s son Yoash, and she \add sneaked him away from among\add* the king’s sons who were about to be killed, and she hid him and his nurse in a bedroom.

\v 1 \add The following year\add*, \add the priest\add* Yehoyada \add took courage\add* and made an agreement with the commanders of units of one hundred \add soldiers\add*: Azaryah (Yehoram’s son), Yishmael (Yehohanan’s son), \add another\add* Azaryah (Oved’s son), Maaseyah (Adayah’s son), and Elishafat (Zikri’s son).
\v 2 They went throughout Yehudah and gathered all the Levites and the \add clan leaders\add* from all the cities. \add When\add* they came to Yerushalem,
\v 3 all the assembly \add made an agreement\add* with the \add young\add* king in the \add temple\add*, and \add Yehoyada\add* told them, “Listen, the \add late\add* king’s son will reign, just as Yahweh said concerning David’s descendants.\x + \xo 23:3: \xt 2Sam 7:12.\x*
\v 4 \add Now\add* this is what all of you need to do: one third of you priests and Levites who’re on duty on the Rest Day, must guard the \add temple\add* \add entrances\add*.
\v 5 Another third of you \add must guard\add* the king’s \add palace\add*, and the \add final\add* third \add guard\add* the Foundation Gate and all the people in the \add temple\add* courtyard.
\v 6 Don’t let anyone enter Yahweh’s \add temple\add* other than the priests and the Levites who’re on duty, because they’re consecrated. \add Every one else must respect Yahweh’s instructions\add* \add not to enter\add*.
\v 7 \add You\add* Levites must \add be armed\add* and surround the \add young\add* king. \add You must kill anyone else who tries to enter the temple, but stay close to the king wherever he goes\add*.
\p
\v 8 \add So\add* the Levites and the other people did \add everything\add* that Yehoyada the priest had instructed. Each \add leader\add* took his men, both those starting duty on the Rest Day, as well as the others \add finishing their duties that day\add*, because Yehoyada \add didn’t dismiss any of the groups\add*.
\v 9 Then Yehoyada the priest gave each of those commanders the spears, and the large and small shields which \add had been put in the temple by\add* King David.
\v 10 He stationed all the people, each one holding his weapon, \add right across the end of the temple\add* around the altar and the \add temple\add*, and all around the king.
\v 11 Then they brought out \add young Yoash\add* and put a crown on \add his head\add* and gave him \add a scroll with the agreement on it\add*, and proclaimed him as king. Then Yehoyada and his sons anointed him \add with olive oil\add* and shouted, “\add Long\add* live the king!”
\p
\v 12 \add When\add* Atalyah heard the sound of people running, and \add people\add* praising the king, she went to the \add temple\add*
\v 13 to look, and wow, the \add young\add* king was standing \add where previous kings had stood\add* by the pillar at the \add temple\add* entrance, with the commanders and trumpeters beside him.

\p
\v 14 The Yehoyada the priest instructed the commanders, “\add Kill her,\add* but not \add here\add* at Yahweh’s temple. \add March her outside and kill anyone who sticks up for\add* her.”

\p
\v 8 The king ordered that a chest be made and placed outside the \add main\add* \add temple\add* entrance.
\v 9 They made an announcement in Yerushalem and \add throughout\add* Yehudah to bring to Yahweh the \add tax instituted\add* by God’s servant Mosheh \add when they were still\add* in the wilderness.
\v 10 All the officials and the people agreed \add with this policy, so\add* they brought \add their contributions\add* and dropped them into the chest until it filled up.
\v 11 Every day when the Levites who’d been given oversight over the chest by the king, saw that it was full, they’d \add fetch\add* one of the king’s secretaries along with one the the head priest’s officials, and they’d empty the box and return it to its place, so they amassed \add a large sum of\add* money.
\p
\v 12 The king and Yehoyada \add the priest\add* gave \add the collected funds\add* to those who worked on the \add temple renovations\add*. They \add used them\add* to hire stone-workers and \add carpenters\add* to restore the \add temple building\add*, as well as for iron and bronze craftsmen.
\v 13 \add So\add* they \add started on the work\add* and the \add temple restoration went ahead\add*. They rebuilt the \add temple following\add* it’s \add original\add* specifications, and strengthened it.
\v 14 Whey they’d finished, they brought the remainder of the funds \add back\add* to the king and Yehoyada, and they made items for \add the temple\add*, items \add used in\add* ministery and for burnt offerings, and dishes and gold and silver items. During Yehoyada’s \add time\add*, they were offering regular burnt sacrifices in Yahweh’s \add temple\add*.

\v 15 \add By then,\add* Yehoyada \add was getting old\add*, and he died \add at the age of\add* 130,

\v 17 After Yehoyada’s death, Yehudah’s leaders went to \add young King\add* Yoash and \add declared their loyalty\add* to \add him\add*, and \add he\add* listened to them.
\v 18 Then they abandoned the \add temple\add* of their ancestors’ god Yahweh, and they \add worshipped\add* the Asherah \add poles\add* and idols, and \add God\add* was angry at Yerushalem and Yehudah because of their \add disobedience\add*.
\v 19 He sent prophets to \add tell them\add* to return back to \add him\add*, and \add although they warned the people, they didn’t take any notice\add*.

\v 23 \add Around\add* the end of the year, the Aramean army \add attacked\add* Yehudah and Yerushalem, and \add killed\add* all the people’s leaders. They sent all their plunder \add back to their\add* king in Damascus.
\v 24 \add Actually, the Arameans only had a smallish army, but Yahweh allowed them to defeat the much larger\add* army \add from Yehudah\add* and \add bring punishment to\add* \add King\add* Yoash, because they had abandoned Yahweh, the god of their fathers.
\v 25 When they \add withdrew\add*, they left \add Yoash\add* with severe wounds, and then his servants conspired against him because he’d killed the \add son\add* of the priest Yehoyada. \add So\add* they killed him in his bed, and \add although\add* they buried him in ‘The City of David’, he wasn’t buried \add with the other\add* kings.

\v 4 \add However,\add* he didn’t order their sons to be executed because he obeyed Yahweh’s instructions that had been written down by Mosheh \add (Moses)\add*, “Fathers mustn’t die \add because of what their sons did\add*, and sons mustn’t die \add because of what their parents did\add*, but each \add individual should be punished for their own disobedience\add*.”\x + \xo 25:4: \xt Deu 24:16.\x*
\p
\v 5 Then Amatsyah \add summoned\add* Yehudah’s \add men\add* and appointed some by \add their clans\add* to be leaders of hundreds and of thousands, for all of Yehudah and Benyamin. \add They counted\add* three-hundred thousand men who were twenty and over, and \add suitable for fighting\add* with a spear and shield.
\v 6 He \add also\add* hired one-hundred thousand \add powerful warriors\add* from Yisrael for three tonnes of silver.
\p
\v 7 \add However,\add* a man of God came and told him, “\add Your majesty\add*, don’t let Yisrael’s \add soldiers\add* go with you, because Yahweh isn’t with Yisrael—those Efrayimites.\f + \fr 25:7 \ft The northern kingdom of Yisrael also came to be known as ‘Efrayim’ (similar how the area of the tribes of Yehudah and Benyamin (plus others who moved in—see 11:16) became known as ‘Yehudah’).\f*
\v 8 \add Even if\add* you go \add and\add* \add fight courageously in\add* battle, God will cause you \add to be defeated\add* by the enemy, because God has the power to help and \add the power to\add* overthrow.”
\p
\v 9 “\add So\add* what should I do about \add all the silver\add* that I’ve \add already\add* paid to the troops from Yisrael?” Amatsyah \add asked\add*.
\p “Yahweh \add can do much more for\add* you than that,” God’s man \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 10 \add So\add* \add King\add* Amatsyah dismissed the troops from \add Yisrael\add* to go home \add again\add*, \add but\add* they were \add extremely angry\add* with Yehudah, and they got home \add still\add* \add feeling furious\add*.
\p
\v 11 Then Amatsyah \add took courage\add* and led his \add army\add* out to the Salt Valley \add where\add* \add they\add* \add slaughtered\add* ten thousand \add Edomite\add* \add soldiers\add*.
\v 12 Yehudah \add rounded up another ten thousand\add* and \add herded\add* them to the top of a cliff \add where they drove them over to kill them\add*.
\p
\v 13 \add However,\add* \add during that time\add*, the \add warriors\add* that Amatsyah had sent back \add to Yisrael\add*, raided Yehudah’s cities \add all the way\add* from Shomron \add (Samaria)\add* to Beyt-Horon. They’d \add killed\add* three thousand \add people\add* and taken \add back\add* a large amount of plunder.

\p
\v 14 After \add King\add* Amatsyah returned from \add fighting\add* the Edomites, he brought \add back\add* their \add idols\add* and set them up to be \add his\add* gods—bowing down to them and offering sacrifices.
\v 15 \add That made\add* Yahweh \add very\add* angry at Amatsyah, and he sent a prophet to tell him, “Why \add did you want those\add* gods who weren’t \add even able to save their own people from your army\add*?”
\p
\v 16 While he was still speaking, \add the king\add* \add snapped at\add* him, “\add Who asked you to be my\add* counsellor? \add Stop right this minute or\add* they’ll strike you down?”
\p \add So\add* the prophet stopped \add talking\add*, \add but then he added\add*, “I know that God has \add decided\add* to destroy you because you’ve done that, and \add because\add* you didn’t listen to my advice.”
\s1 Yehudah brings trouble on itself
\s4 Both kingdoms
\p
\v 17 \add Some time later,\add* Yehudah’s King Amatsyah \add consulted his advisors\add*, then sent \add a challenge\add* to Yisrael’s King Yoash (son of Yehoahaz, son of Yehu), “Let’s face each other \add on the battlefield\add*.”
\v 18 \add But\add* Yisrael’s King Yosash \add replied\add*, “A thistle that was in Lebanon sent to a cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son for a wife,’ but some \add random\add* animal passed through the Lebanese countryside and trampled the thistle.
\v 19 You \add defeated\add* Edom and \add now it’s gone to your head\add*. \add So stay in your chair at home and don’t get over-excited, otherwise both you and Yehudah will be toppled\add*.”
\p
\v 20 \add But\add* \add King\add* Amatsyah \add took no notice\add*, because God \add was planning for him to be defeated for worshipping\add* Edom’s gods.
\v 21 \add So\add* Yisrael’s King Yoash \add advanced\add*, and \add the two armies faced each other\add* at Beyt-Shemesh in Yehudah,
\v 22 and Yehudah was \add badly defeated\add* by Yisrael, and \add all their warriors fled back home\add*.
\v 23 Yisrael’s King Yoash captured King Amatsyah (son of Yoash, son of Yehoahaz) at Beyt-Shemesh and took him to Yerushalem. Then he tore down Yerushalem’s wall from the Efraim Gate to the Corner Gate—a section about 180m long.
\v 24 He took all the gold and silver and \add other valuable items that Oved-Edom had been guarding in the temple\add* back to Shomron \add (Samaria)\add*, along with any valuables from the \add palace\add* and some hostages.
\p
\v 25 After the death of Yisrael’s King Yoash (son of Yehoahaz), Yehudah’s King Amatsyah lived for a further fifteen years.
\v 26 \add The account\add* of everything else done by Amatsyah \add was written\add* in the scroll of ‘The Kings of Yehudah and Yisrael’.
\v 27 From the time that Amatsyah had turned from following Yahweh, \add there was a conspiracy to assassinate him\add* in Yerushalem, \add but\add* he fled to Lakish. \add However,\add* they \add traced him\add* to Lakish and killed him there.
\v 28 They used horses to carry his body back \add to Yerushalem\add*, and he was buried with his ancestors in ‘The City of David’.\f + \fr 25:28 \ft The Hebrew actually has the unusual ‘The City of Yehudah’ here.\f*

\s1 Yehudah’s King Uzziyah

\r (2 Kgs 14:21-22; 15:1-7)
\p
\v 1 Then all the people took sixteen year old Uzziyah and made him king to replace his father Amatsyah.
\v 2 \add Uzziyah\add* restored Eylat City to Yehudah and rebuilt it after \add the death of his father\add*.
\p
\v 3 Uzziyah was sixteen when he became king, and he reigned from Yerushalem for fifty-two years. His mother was Yekolyah from Yerushalem.
\v 4 \add He\add* did \add the things that Yahweh said were good, like\add* his father Amatsyah had done.
\v 5 He \add strived to follow\add* God \add during the lifetime of\add* Zekaryah who instructed him. During the time that he \add obeyed\add* Yahweh, God \add made him successful\add*.
\p
\v 6 \add Uzziyah\add* went to attack the Philistines, and \add successfully\add* broke through the walls at Gat, Yavneh, and Ashdod. He \add rebuilt\add* Ashdod \add and other\add* cities in the Philistia \add region\add*.
\v 7 God helped him against the Philistines, against the Arabians who living in Gurbaal, and \add against\add* the Meunites.
\v 8 The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziyah, and his \add fame spread\add* as far as the Egyptian border because he was becoming more powerful.
\p
\v 9 \add King\add* Uzziyah built \add fortified\add* towers in Yerushalem at the Corner Gate, the Valley Gate, and at the angle in the wall.
\v 10 He \add also\add* built towers in the wilderness and dug many wells because he had a lot of cattle—both in the lowlands and in the plains. He was \add also interested in horticulture so\add* he had workers stationed in his vineyards and in his fertile fields.
\p
\v 11 \add Uzziyah’s army was trained for fighting\add* battles and organised into divisions set up by Yeiel the scribe and the commander Maaseyah, under the supervision of Hananyah, one of the king’s officials.
\v 12 There were 2,600 \add clan leaders\add* who led the \add powerful warriors\add*,
\v 13 and \add the full force of\add* 37,500 \add was under them\add* to support the king against his \add enemies\add*.
\v 14 Uzziyah \add supplied\add* \add shields, spears, helmets, armoured vests, bows, and slingshots\add* for the entire army.
\v 15 \add Using a local\add* invention, he made war machines in Yerushalem to be placed on the towers and corners \add of the walls\add* to fire arrows and large stones. His fame \add now\add* \add spread widely\add* because he’d received a lot of help that had made him very powerful.
\p
\v 16 \add However,\add* \add at the peak of\add* his strength he \add became very arrogant and that led to his\add* destruction. He \add disobeyed\add* his god Yahweh and went into the \add temple\add* to burn incense on the incense altar.
\v 17 The high priest Azaryah and eighty other \add brave\add* priests went in after him.
\v 18 They \add confronted\add* King Uzziyah and \add challenged\add* him, “It’s not \add permitted\add* for you, Uzziyah, to sacrifice to Yahweh, only for Aharon’s descendants the priests—the ones consecrated to sacrifice. Leave the sanctuary, because you’ve \add disobeyed\add* Yahweh God \add so now\add* he won’t honour you.”\x + \xo 26:18: \xt Exo 30:7-8; Num 3:10.\x*
\p
\v 19 Then Uzziyah who was holding an incense pan, became very angry, \add but\add* when he \add started\add* raging at the priests, spots of leprosy \add suddenly\add* appeared on his forehead while he was still there beside the incense altar in front of the priests.
\v 20 The high priest Azaryah looked \add more closely\add*, and \add confirming that it was indeed\add* leprosy on his forehead, hurried him outside. \add The king\add* was \add now also\add* in a hurry because Yahweh had afflicted him.
\p
\v 21 King Uzziyah had leprosy until he died, \add so\add* he had to live in an isolated residence and wasn’t allowed to \add approach the temple\add*. His son Yotam \add (Jotham)\add* \add stood in for him\add*—supervising the \add palace\add* and \add ruling Yehudah\add*.
\p
\v 22 The record of all the other things done by Uzziyah \add while he was king\add* was written by the prophet Yeshayah \add (Isaiah)\add* (son of Amots).
\v 23 \add When Uzziyah died\add*, because of his leprosy they buried him with his ancestors in a grave in the countryside for kings, and his son Yotam replaced him as king.\x + \xo 26:23: \xt Isa 6:1.\x*

\v 1 Yotam \add (Jotham)\add* was twenty-five when he became king, and he reigned from Yerushalem for sixteen years. His mother was Yerusha, daughter of \add the priest\add* Tsadok.
\v 2 He did \add the things that Yahweh said were good\add* like his father Uzziyah had done (except that he didn’t \add trespass\add* in Yahweh’s temple), \add However,\add* the people were still behaving corruptly.
\p
\v 3 He rebuilt the Upper Gate of the \add temple\add*, and \add extended\add* the Ofel wall.
\v 4 He built cities in the Yehudah hill country, and built fortresses and towers in the forests.
\v 5 He \add attacked\add* the Ammonite king and \add dominated\add* them. \add Then for the next three years\add*, the Ammonites brought him three tonnes of silver, and 2,000 tonnes each of wheat and barley each year.
\v 6 Yotham became more powerful because he’d established \add a pattern of obeying\add* his god Yahweh.
\v 7 The record of all the other things done by Yotam \add while he was king\add*, including all his battles, was written on the scroll ‘The kings of Yisrael and Yehudah’.

\r (2 Kgs 16:5)
\p
\v 5 \add So\add* his god Yahweh \add allowed \add KinG Ahaz\add* to be defeated by\add* the king of Aram—they attacked and took many prisoners \add back\add* to Damascus. \add In addition,\add* \add Yahweh\add* \add allowed the king of Yisrael to be victorious and they slaughtered many fighters\add*.\x + \xo 28:5-6: \xt 2Ki 16:5; Isa 7:1.\x*
\v 6 Yisrael’s King Pekah (Remalyah’s son) killed 120,000 \add powerful warriors\add* in Yehudah in one day, after they’d abandoned the god of their ancestors.
\v 7 A warrior from Efrayim \add named\add* Zikri killed King Ahaz’s son Maaseyah, Azrikam the \add palace supervisor\add*, and Elkanah the king’s second-in-command.
\v 8 Yisrael’s soldiers captured two-hundred thousand of their relatives, including their wives and \add children\add*. They also took a lot of plunder back to Shomron \add (Samaria)\add* with them.
\s2 The prophet Oded
\p
\v 9 \add Now\add* there was a prophet of Yahweh \add named\add* Oded, and he went out to the army \add of Yisrael\add* as it was returning to Shomron, and told them, “Listen, Yahweh, the god of your ancestors was angry with Yehudah, so he \add helped you all defeat them\add*. \add However,\add* you all killed them in rage \add and\add* \add God has taken notice\add*.
\v 10 Now you want to \add keep the people of Yerushalem and Yehudah as your own male and female slaves\add*, \add but that would certainly make you all guilty before\add* your god Yahweh.
\v 11 \add So then,\add* listen to me and return those captives \add because\add* \add they’re your own relatives\add*, as Yahweh \add is extremely angry at\add* you all.”
\p
\v 12 Then \add some of the leaders of the Efrayim tribe took action\add* and \add confronted\add* \add those returning from battle\add*: Azaryah (Yehohanan’s son), Berekyah (Meshillemot’s son), Yehizkiyah (Shallum’s son), and Amasa (Hadlai’s son)
\v 13 told \add the ones returning\add*, “Don’t bring those captives here, because \add that would be disobedience and adding to the rest of our disobedience and wrongs\add*, as \add Yahweh’s already\add* angry at \add us here in\add* Yisrael.”
\v 14 \add So\add* the \add returning\add* \add soldiers\add* released the captives in front of the leaders and all the assembled \add people\add*, and \add dropped all the plunder\add* \add there as well\add*.
\v 15 Then some men \add from Yisrael\add* \add were called out by name to come and search the plunder to find clothes and\add* dress the naked captives \add from Yehudah\add* and give them sandals. Then they \add gave them food and drink, as well as oil\add* \add to rub on their wounds\add*. They gave donkeys to those who \add couldn’t easily walk\add*, and took them to Yeriho (The City of Palms) which was nearer their relatives, then those men returned to Shomron \add (Samaria)\add*.
\p
\v 16 Around that time, King Ahaz \add requested help from\add* the Assyrian kings
\v 17 as the Edomites had been and attacked Yehudah and taken captives.
\v 18 \add Also\add* the Philistines had raided the lowland cities and the Negev, and they’d captured Beyt-Shemesh, Ayyalon, Gederoth, as well as Sokoh, Timnah, and Gimzo with their surrounding villages
\v 19 because Yahweh was humbling King Ahaz as he’d \add thrown off\add* restraint in Yehudah and been very unfaithful to Yahweh.
\v 20 \add So\add* the Assyrian King Tiglat-Pileser came, \add except\add* he \add ended up\add* \add adding to his troubles rather than helping\add*.
\v 21 Ahaz gave the Assyrian king \add valuables from the temple and the palace and from other leaders\add*, \add but that didn’t\add* help.
\s1 Ahaz’s disobedience
\p
\v 22 \add While King Ahaz was experiencing those troubles, he disobeyed Yahweh even more\add*
\v 23 and sacrificed to the gods of Damascus (\add because Aram had defeated him\add*). He \add reasoned\add*, “Since the gods of the Aramean kings helped them, I’ll sacrifice to them, and then they’ll help me.” \add However,\add* that led to Ahaz’s fall, and \add to the fall of\add* all Yehudah.\f + \fr 28:23 \ft Sometimes in 2 Chronicles, Yehudah is referred to as Yisrael, but as that can be confusing for readers, we’ve made adjustments.\f*
\v 24 Then Ahaz gathered all the furnishings \add that were used\add* in the \add temple\add*, and broke them into pieces and locked the \add temple\add* doors. Then he set up \add pagan\add* altars at every Yerushalem \add intersection\add*
\v 25 and in every Yehudah city he set up hilltop shrines to make sacrifices to other gods, \add thus\add* angering Yahweh, the god of his ancestors.
\p
\v 26 The record of all the other things done by Ahaz \add while he was king\add* was written on the scroll ‘The kings of Yehudah and Yisrael’.
\v 27 Then Ahaz died and was buried in ‘The City of David’, but not in the tombs of the \add other\add* kings of Yisrael. Then his son Hizkiyah \add replaced him as king\add*.\x + \xo 28:27: \xt Isa 14:28.\x*
