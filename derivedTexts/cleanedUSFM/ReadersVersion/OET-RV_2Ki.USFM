\mt2 The second summary of the
\mt1 Kings of Yisrael and Yehudah
\is1 Introduction
\ip \bk The second summary of the kings of Yisrael/Israel and Yehudah/Judah\bk* is a continuation of the first summary about the northern kingdom of Yisrael and the Southern kingdom of Yehudah (Judah). This account can be divided into two: \bd 1.\bd* The account about the two kingdoms from around 850 before Yeshua/Jesus (B.C.) through to the defeat of Shomron (Samaria) and the fall of the northern king in 721 before Yeshua/Jesus (B.C.) \bd 2.\bd* The account about the Southern kingdom of Yehudah from the defeat of the northern kingdom of Yisrael through to the capture and destruction of Yerushalem (Jerusalem) by the Babylonian King Nevukadnetstsar in 586 before Yeshua/Jesus (B.C.) This account ends with Gedalyah governing Yehudah under Babylonian instructions, and then the release of King Yehoyakin who’d been imprisoned in Babylon.
\ip Those disasters and destruction occurred because the leaders and inhabitants of the divided kingdom didn’t obey God. The demolition of Yerushalem and the exile of most of the people of Yehudah was a major tragedy in Yisrael’s history.
\ip Prophet Elisha is highlighted here in this second summary. Elisha was the dominant prophet who continued on after Eliyyah’s death.

\s1 Yahweh punishes King Ahazyah
\s4 Northern kingdom
\p
\v 1 After the death of \add Yisrael’s King\add* Ahab, Moab rebelled against Yisrael.
\p
\v 2 \add One day, King\add* Ahazyah fell through a lattice in his upper room in Shomron \add (Samaria)\add* and was injured, \add so\add* he sent messengers to go and ask Ekron’s God Baal-Zevuv if he would recover.
\v 3 \add But\add* Yahweh’s messenger told Eliyyah (from Tishbe), “\add Leave here\add* \add and\add* go and meet the Shomron king’s messengers and \add ask\add* them, ‘Is it because there’s no God in Yisrael that you’re all going to inquire from Ekron’s God Baal-Zevuv?
\v 4 \add Because of that,\add* Yahweh says that \add the king\add* won’t get out of the bed that he’s lying in—he’s definitely going to die.”
\p \add So\add* Eliyyah \add told them and\add* \add continued\add* on his way.
\v 5 \add When\add* the messengers returned to \add the king\add*, he \add asked\add* them, “What’s this? \add Why are you back here\add* \add so soon\add*?”
\p
\v 6 “A man \add came\add* to meet us,” they told him, “and he said to us, ‘Go \add and\add* return to the king who sent you, and tell him that Yahweh says this: Is it because there’s no God in Yisrael that you are sending \add messengers\add* to inquire from Ekron’s God Baal-Zevuv? Therefore you’ll never leave that bed that you’re lying in but you’ll certainly die \add in it\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 7 “What was the man \add like\add*,” the king \add asked\add* them, “who met you and \add gave you all that message\add*?”
\p
\v 8 “\add He had a cloak made of animal\add* hair,” they \add answered\add*, “and \add was wearing a leather belt\add*.”
\p “\add Ah,\add*” said \add the king\add*. “That’s Eliyyah \add from Tishbe\add*.”
\p
\v 9 \add So\add* he sent a captain with his fifty soldiers to look for \add Eliyyah\add* and they found him sitting on the top of a hill. The captain \add called out\add*, “Man of God, the king \add wants to see you\add*.”
\p
\v 10 \add But\add* Eliyyah replied, “\add Well,\add* if I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your \add men\add*,” and fire came down from the sky, and it \add burnt up the captain and his men\add*.
\p
\v 11 \add So\add* \add the king\add* sent another captain with his fifty men and they went to where Eliyyah was and called out to him, “Prophet, the king commands that you come \add with us right now\add*.”
\p
\v 12 \add Again\add* Eliyyah replied, “If I am a man of God, let fire come down from the sky and consume you and your \add men\add*,” and God’s fire came down from the sky, and it \add burnt up the captain and his men\add*.
\p
\v 13 \add So\add* \add the king\add* sent a third captain with his fifty men. They went to where Eliyyah was and the officer knelt down in front of him and \add pleaded\add*, “Prophet, I \add beg\add* you, be kind to me and my fifty soldiers, and don’t kill us.
\v 14 Listen, fire came down from the sky and burnt up the first two captains and their \add men, but please treat my life as valuable in your sight\add*.”
\p
\v 15 Then Yahweh’s messenger told Eliyyah, “Go with \add them\add*. Don’t be afraid of him.”
\p So Eliyyah went with \add them\add* to the king
\v 16 and told him, “Yahweh says that you sent messengers to inquire from Ekron’s God Baal-Zevuv, \add as if\add* there’s no God in Yisrael to \add ask\add*. Therefore, \add he says,\add* \add you certainly won’t get off that bed that you’re on\add* because you’ll die \add in it\add*.”
\p
\v 17 \add So\add* \add King Ahazyah\add* died \add just as Yahweh had said via\add* Eliyyah. Then \add Ahazyah’s younger brother\add* Yehoram \add (Joram)\add* became king in his place, because \add Ahazyah\add* \add didn’t have any sons\add*. \add This happened\add* in the second year \add of the reign\add* of Yehoshafat’s son King Yehoram over Yehudah.
\v 18 \add Everything else that Ahazyah said and did is written in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Yisrael.

\s1 Eliyyah is taken up to heaven
\s4 Northern kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add One day as\add* Eliyyah and Elisha \add had left\add* Gilgal, Yahweh took Eliyyah up to heaven in a storm.
\v 2 Eliyyah had told Elisha, “Now, you stay here because Yahweh has \add told me to go\add* to Beyt-El.”
\p “By the life of Yahweh,” Elisha \add had responded\add*, “and by the life of your spirit, I won’t leave you.” \add So they’d headed\add* to Beyt-El.
\p
\v 3 \add Also\add* the \add prophets-in-training\add* who were in Beyt-El had gone out to Elisha and told him, “Do you know that today Yahweh is going to take your master \add away from you\add*?”
\p “I \add already know that\add*,” he’d \add replied\add*. “\add Don’t say anything\add*.”
\p
\v 4 Then Eliyyah \add had informed\add* Elisha, “Yahweh has sent me to Yericho \add (Jericho)\add*. You stay here.”
\p He’d \add answered\add*, “By the life of Yahweh and the life of your spirit, I won’t leave you.” \add So they’d gone\add* to Yericho.
\p
\v 5 The \add prophets-in-training\add* who were in Yericho \add had approached\add* Elisha and \add briefed\add* him, “Do you know that today Yahweh is taking your master \add away from you\add*?”
\p “\add Yes, I realise that\add*,” he’d \add responded\add*. “\add Say no more\add*.”
\p
\v 6 \add Again\add* Eliyyah had told him, “You stay here, because Yahweh has sent me to the Yordan.”
\p And he’d \add countered\add*, “By the life of Yahweh and the life of your spirit, I won’t leave you.” \add So the two of them had gone there together\add*.
\v 7 \add Fifty of the prophets-in-training had also gone, but they’d stood back watching from a distance, so the two of them had stood there\add* by the Yordan.
\v 8 Then Eliyyah had taken off his cloak and \add doubled it over\add* and hit the river \add with it\add*. The water divided \add leaving a dry path and the two of them had walked across\add* \add to the other side\add*.
\v 9 As they’d crossed over, Eliyyah had told Elisha, “\add Tell me what you’d like me to do for you before I get taken away\add*.”
\p “Please,” Elisha \add had answered\add*, “\add I’d like a\add* double amount of \add the spirit that you have\add*.”
\p
\v 10 “\add Oh,\add* \add that’s a difficult request\add*,” \add Eliyyah\add* \add had responded\add*. “\add Well,\add* if you see me being taken \add away\add* from you, \add then you’ll get what you asked for, but if you miss seeing me go, you won’t\add*.”
\p
\v 11 Then it had happened \add while\add* they were walking and talking \add together\add*. Wow, a chariot of fire and horses of fire \add drove\add* between the two of them, \add separating them\add*. Then Eliyyah went up to the heavens in the gale.
\v 12 Elisha was watching, and he cried out, “My father, my father, Yisrael’s chariot and its horsemen!”
\p \add But then\add* \add Elisha\add* could no longer see him, and he grabbed his \add own\add* \add cloak\add*, and tore \add it\add* in half,
\v 13 and he picked up Eliyyah’s cloak that had fallen \add down to the ground\add*. Then he went back and stood on the bank of the Yordan,
\v 14 and he took Eliyyah’s cloak and \add hit the river\add* \add with it\add*, saying, “Where is Eliyyah’s God Yahweh?” \add Then as\add* he hit the water, \add the river divided into two parts\add* and Elisha crossed \add through the middle\add*.
\v 15 The \add prophets-in-training\add* who were \add on the Yericho side, affirmed\add*, “\add Elisha now has the spirit that Eliyyah had\add*.” Then they came \add forward\add* to meet him and \add knelt down in front of him\add* \add as a sign of respect\add*,
\v 16 and they \add requested\add*, “Listen please, \add fifty of us here have military training\add*. Please, let them go to search for your master, in case Yahweh’s spirit lifted him and \add dropped\add* him on \add a hill somewhere\add* or into one of the valleys.”
\p “\add Don’t waste your time\add*,” he \add replied\add*.
\v 17 But they \add kept insisting so much that Elisha was embarrassed\add* and he said, “\add Ok then\add*.”
\p \add So\add* they sent fifty men, and they searched for three days, but they didn’t find \add Eliyyah\add*.
\v 18 \add When\add* they returned to \add Elisha\add* (he was staying in Yericho), he said to them, “Didn’t I \add tell you not to bother\add*?”
\p
\v 19 Then the \add leaders\add* of \add Yericho\add* city said to Elisha, “Please, \add this city is a good place to live\add*, just as my master can see, but the water \add supplies around here\add* are bad \add so our crops don’t thrive\add*.”
\p
\v 20 “Bring me a \add brand\add* new bowl,” he said, “and put salt there.” \add So\add* they brought \add one\add* to him,
\v 21 and he went out to the \add spring\add* and threw the salt at it, and \add announced\add*, “Yahweh says that he’s healed these water \add supplies\add* and \add they’ll no longer cause\add* death or barrenness.”
\v 22 \add So now those water supplies have been healthy and beneficial until this day, just as Elisha had said\add*.
\p
\v 23 From there \add Elisha\add* went to Beyt-El, and as he was going up on the road, \add some\add* young men came out from the city, and \add started\add* mocking him, saying, “\add Keep moving, baldy. Keep moving, baldy\add*.”
\p
\v 24 Then \add Elisha\add* turned \add back around\add* and \add looked at\add* them, and he cursed them in Yahweh’s name. \add Just then,\add* two female bears came out from the forest and mauled forty-two of \add them\add*.
\p
\v 25 \add Elisha\add* carried on from there to Mt. Karmel, and from there, he returned to Shomron \add (Samaria)\add*.

\s1 The war between Yisrael and Moab
\s4 Northern kingdom
\p
\v 1 Ahab’s son Yehoram \add (Jehoram)\add* became king over Yisrael in the eighteenth year of King Yehoshafat’s \add reign over\add* Yehudah, and he reigned from Shomron \add (Samaria)\add* for twelve years.
\v 2 He did \add what Yahweh had said\add* was evil, \add but not as bad as\add* his father and mother \add had been\add*, and he did remove the pillar of Baal that his father had made.
\v 3 \add However,\add* he \add committed similar sins to those\add* of Nebat’s son Yarave’am who had caused Yisrael to sin and didn’t \add stop doing\add* them.
\v 4 \add Now\add* Moab’s King Mesha was a sheep breeder, and he would \add pay an annual tribute\add* to Yisrael’s king of a hundred thousand young rams, plus the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
\v 5 \add However,\add* after King Ahab died, Moab’s king rebelled against Yisrael’s \add control over them\add*.
\v 6 \add So\add* King Yehoram set out from Shomron and mustered all \add of Yisrael’s fighters\add*.
\v 7 Then he sent this message to King Yehoshafat of Yehudah, “Moab’s king has rebelled against me. Will you \add join in battle with me against them\add*?”
\p “I’ll \add join you\add*,” he \add replied\add*. “\add You and me are together. My people are your people, and my horses are your horses\add*.
\v 8 \add What’s our strategy? Which way should we go in\add*?” he \add asked\add*.
\p “\add Through\add* the Edom wilderness,” he \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 9 \add So\add* the kings of Yisrael, Yehudah, and Edom \add took their armies\add* on a seven day trip \add circling around\add*, but they \add didn’t find enough\add* water for the men or their animals,
\v 10 and Yisrael’s king \add complained\add*, “Oh \add dear\add*, \add it seems that\add* Yahweh \add has sent in us\add* three kings to \add allow Moab to defeat us\add*.”
\v 11 \add But\add* Yehoshafat \add asked\add*, “Isn’t there one of Yahweh’s prophets here, so we might inquire from Yahweh through him?”
\p “There’s Elisha,” one of the servants of Yisrael’s king answered, “Shafat’s son, \add the prophet\add* who \add was Eliyyah’s assistant\add*.”
\p
\v 12 “\add Yes,\add* \add he receives Yahweh’s messages\add*,” said Yehoshafat.
\p So the kings of Yisrael, Yehudah, and Edom, went to see him.
\v 13 \add But\add* Elisha \add asked\add* Yisrael’s king, “What \add do you and me have in common\add*? Go \add and inquire from\add* your father’s prophets and your mother’s prophets.”
\p “No,” the king of Yisrael said. “\add We came\add* because Yahweh has called for \add us\add* three kings to \add allow us to be defeated by\add* Moab.”
\p
\v 14 “\add As army commander Yahweh lives\add*,” Elisha \add responded\add*, “\add the one who I serve\add*, I wouldn’t \add be talking to you or even face you, if I hadn’t recognised\add* King Yehoshafat of Yehudah.
\v 15 \add So now\add* bring me a \add musician\add*.
\p Then while the musician played, Yahweh \add spoke to him\add*
\v 16 and he said, “Yahweh says that this valley \add will store lots of water\add*.\f + \fr 3:16 \ft It’s not really clear if he’s saying that Yahweh will fill natural pools in the valley with water, or if he’s instructing the armies to dig trenches or scrape pools that Yahweh will then fill with water.\f*
\v 17 \add He\add* says that you all won’t see any wind or rain, \add yet\add* this valley will be filled with water, and you and your animals \add will have plenty\add* to drink.
\v 18 \add That’s a piece of cake\add* for Yahweh. \add What’s more, he’ll give you victory over\add* Moab.
\v 19 You’ll all \add attack every important city, including their fortified ones\add*. You can chop down their fruit trees, block up their springs, and ruin their good land with stones.”
\p
\v 20 \add The next day at the time of the morning\add* sacrifice, \add to their amazement\add* there was water flowing from Edom and covering the ground.
\p
\v 21 \add By then\add*, \add the people of\add* Moab had heard that the kings had come to battle them, \add so\add* they summoned \add everyone who could wear a sword and stationed them\add* beside the border.
\v 22 \add But\add* when they got up early the next morning and the sun rose, from \add the direction where they were, the water appeared to be\add* red like blood.
\v 23 “That’s blood,” they \add exclaimed\add*. “Those \add three\add* kings \add must have turned against each other and killed each other. So let’s go, Moab, and collect the spoil\add*.”
\p
\v 24 \add But\add* when they reached the \add allied\add* camp, the \add allies attacked\add* and they fled \add away\add*. Then the \add allies entered Moab and attacked there\add*.
\v 25 They tore down the cities, and \add each person threw a stone onto the good land, making it useless\add*. They \add blocked up\add* every spring, and they \add chopped down\add* every good tree. \add Eventually,\add* only \add their capital city of\add* Kir-Hareset remained standing \add with its stone walls, but they attacked that as well using slingshots\add*.
\p
\v 26 \add When\add* Moab’s king saw that the \add attackers\add* were stronger than them, he took a team of seven hundred swordsmen to try to break through to the king of Edom, \add but they failed\add*.
\v 27 \add So\add* he took his oldest son (who would have become the next king) and sacrificed him \add publicly on top of the city\add* wall. \add This made their people crazy furious\add* against Yisrael, so they left and returned home.

\s1 Elisha helps a poor widow
\s4 Northern kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add One day\add* a woman \add who was a wife of one of the prophets-in-training\add*, called out to Elisha, “Your servant, my husband, died, and you yourself know that your servant \add served\add* Yahweh. \add Now\add* the moneylender has come to take two of my children \add in payment to become his\add* slaves.”
\p
\v 2 “\add Hmmh,\add* what could I do to help you?” Elisha \add responded\add*. “Tell me, what have you got in your house?”
\p “Your servant’s got nothing in the house except a flask of oil,” she \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 3 He told her, “Go \add and\add* ask for empty containers from all of your neighbours. \add Make sure you get plenty of them\add*.
\v 4 Then go and shut the door behind you and your sons, and pour oil into all those containers. \add Once each one’s full, set it\add* aside.”
\v 5 \add So\add* she went and she shut the door \add of her house\add* \add with her and her sons inside\add*. They would bring \add the empty containers\add* to her, and she poured \add the oil\add*.
\v 6 \add Eventually when she told one of her sons to bring the next container, he told her that there wasn’t any more, and at that point, the oil stopped flowing\add*.
\p
\v 7 Then she went and informed the man of God, and he told her, “Go \add and\add* sell the oil and pay off your debt. Then you and your sons can live on the rest.”
\s1 Elisha brings a child back to life
\s4 Northern kingdom
\p
\v 8 \add One\add* day, Elisha went to Shunem, and there was a \add wealthy\add* woman there who \add invited him in for a meal\add*. \add After that, he dropped in there for a meal whenever he was going past\add*,
\v 9 and the woman said to her husband, “\add You know, I’m sure that this man who often drops in on us\add* is a holy man of God.
\v 10 Please, \add can we make a small upstairs room on our flat roof\add*? And we could put a bed and a lampstand in it for him, plus a table and chair. \add Then whenever he’s passing through here, he’ll have his own spot to stay\add*.”
\p
\v 11 \add Another\add* day when Elisha arrived, he went up to his room and lay down.
\v 12 Then he told his servant Gehazi to call the Shunammite \add woman\add*, \add so\add* he called her and she \add came and\add* stood in front of \add Elisha\add*.
\v 13 He told \add Gehazi\add*, “Now tell her \add that we’ve noticed how she looks after us, and ask her what we can do for her? Can we\add* speak to the king for her or to the captain of the army?”
\p \add But\add* she \add replied\add*, “\add I have family and friends all around me\add*.”
\p
\v 14 \add After she’d left again,\add* he asked \add Gehazi\add*, “\add Well\add*, what can I do for her?”
\p “\add Hmmh,\add*” Gehazi \add replied\add*. “She doesn’t have a son, and her husband is old.”
\p
\v 15 “Call her then,” Elisha said. \add So\add* he called her and she came and stood in the doorway,
\v 16 and \add Elisha\add* told her, “\add In due course after the normal months\add*, you’ll have a son to hold.”
\p “No, my master, man of God,” she \add stammered\add*. “Don’t lie to your female servant.”
\p
\v 17 Then the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son after the normal time, just as Elisha had told her.
\p
\v 18 The child grew up and \add one day\add* he went out to his father who was with the harvesters,
\v 19 and he \add called\add* to his father, “My head, my head.”
\p \add His father\add* told one of the servants, “Carry him \add home\add* to his mother.”
\p
\v 20 \add So\add* \add the servant\add* \add carried him back\add* to his mother, and he sat on her knees until noon when he died.
\v 21 \add His mother\add* \add carried him\add* up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, \add shutting the door behind her as\add* she went out.
\v 22 Then she called her husband and told \add him\add*, “Please send one of the young men and one of the donkeys to me \add so I can run and see\add* the man of God and \add then come back\add*.”
\v 23 “Why are you going there today?” he \add asked\add*. “It’s not a \add religious holiday\add*.”
\p “\add It’ll be okay\add*,” she \add answered\add*,
\v 24 and she saddled the donkey, and told the young man, “\add Now, let’s\add* go! You lead and don’t \add slacken off for my comfort\add* unless I tell you to.”
\v 25 So \add they\add* \add set off to seek\add* out the man of God at Mt. Karmel.
\p When \add Elisha\add* saw her \add coming\add* from a distance, he told Gehazi, “Look, there’s the Shunammite woman.
\v 26 Now, please, run to meet her and \add ask\add* her, ‘Are you all right? Is your husband all right? Is your child all right?’ ”
\p “\add Everything’s all right\add*,” she \add answered\add*.
\v 27 Then she got to the mountain and to the man of God, and she \add knelt and\add* grabbed his feet. Gehazi came over to push her away, \add but\add* the man of God said, “Leave her because \add she’s upset\add*, but Yahweh has hidden \add the problem\add* from me—he hasn’t informed me.”
\p
\v 28 “Did I ask for a son from \add you\add*, my master?” she said. “\add No, but\add* didn’t I say, ‘Don’t \add mislead me\add*?’ ”
\v 29 Then he told Gehazi, “\add Tuck in your robe\add* and take my staff in your hand, and go \add quickly\add*. If you \add meet anyone\add*, \add just keep going and don’t stop to\add* bless them, and if someone blesses you, \add don’t stop to\add* answer them. \add When you get there,\add* lay my staff on the young man’s face.”
\p
\v 30 \add But\add* the mother of the young man said, “By the life of Yahweh and the life of your spirit, I won’t leave \add without\add* you.” \add So\add* he got \add ready\add*, and went \add with\add* her.
\v 31 \add However,\add* Gehazi \add had gone ahead\add* and he put the staff on the young man’s face, but he didn’t \add open his eyes or make a\add* sound. \add So\add* he returned to meet \add Elisha\add* and told him that the young man didn’t wake up.
\p
\v 32 \add When\add* Elisha reached the house, \add it was a shock to see\add* the young man lying on his bed, dead.
\v 33 He went in and he shut the door behind the \add other\add* two, and he prayed to Yahweh.
\v 34 Then he \add got on the bed\add*, and he lay on the child and bent down near him, putting his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his palms on his palms. Then the child’s body \add started getting warmer\add*,
\v 35 and he \add got down\add* and walked \add around the room several times\add*. Then he \add got on the bed\add* \add again\add*, and bent down near him. The young man gasped \add several\add* times, and then opened his eyes.
\v 36 Then he called to Gehazi, and \add told him to call the\add* Shunammite woman, and he called her, and she came and \add Elisha\add* told \add her\add*, “\add Here, take\add* your son.”
\v 37 Then she came in and \add fell to her knees in front of him with her face\add* to the ground. Then she picked up her son and went out,
\v 38 and Elisha returned to Gilgal.
\s1 Two more miracles
\s4 Northern kingdom
\p At that time, there was a drought and the \add prophets-in-training\add* were sitting facing him, and Elisha told his servant, “Get the large pot and boil a stew for \add these prophets-in-training\add*.”
\v 39 One \add person\add* went out to the countryside to gather herbs, and he found a \add wild\add* vine, and he collected \add wild\add* fruit from it—\add as many as he could hold in the fold of his robe\add*. Then \add not realising that they were poisonous\add*, he came and he \add sliced\add* them into the pot of stew.
\v 40 Then they \add served\add* it up for the men to eat, \add but\add* when they ate it, they called out, “Man of God, there’s \add poison\add* in that pot!”
\v 41 “Bring me some flour,” \add Elisha\add* said. Then he threw it into the pot, and said, “\add Serve it up\add* for the people to eat,” and no one was harmed.
\p
\v 42 \add One day\add* a man came from Baal-Shalishah, and he brought to the man of God \add an offering from the beginning of his harvest\add*: twenty loaves of barley bread, and \add newly-harvested\add* corn in his sack, and \add Elisha\add* said \add to his servant\add*, “Give it to \add our\add* people \add so they can\add* eat.”
\p
\v 43 “How \add can I divide that out to\add* one hundred men?” asked his servant.
\p “Give them to the people \add so\add* they can eat,” he \add replied\add*, “because Yahweh says \add that they can eat and have left-overs\add*.”
\v 44 \add So\add* he \add laid it out in front of them\add* and they ate and had left-overs, \add just like Yahweh had said would happen\add*.

\s1 Na’aman’s healing
\s4 Northern kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add Now\add* Na’aman \add was\add* the captain in Aram’s army. \add He\add* was \add highly respected by Aram’s king\add*, and was \add promoted to a high position\add* because \add Yahweh had helped Aram (Syria) win many battles because of him\add*. \add However, despite his\add* military prowess, \add he suffered from a serious skin disease called leprosy\add*.\x + \xo 5:1-14: \xt Luk 4:27.\x*
\v 2 \add Previously\add* troops that had been sent out from Aram, had taken a young Israeli girl captive and she \add had become Na’aman’s wife’s servant\add*.
\v 3 \add One day\add* she said to her mistress, “\add I wish that my master would go and see\add* the prophet who \add lives\add* in Shomron, and then he would \add cure him of\add* his leprosy.”
\v 4 \add In due course, Na’aman heard\add* and went and told \add his master what the young Israeli girl had said\add*.
\v 5 The king of Aram \add responded\add*, “\add Ok, I’ll write a letter to the king of Yisrael for you to take\add*.”
\p \add So\add* \add Na’aman\add* \add set off, taking along\add* 70kg of gold, 300kg of silver, and ten sets of \add fine\add* clothes,
\v 6 and he took the letter to the king of Yisrael. \add The letter\add* said, “\add Greetings\add*. When this letter gets to you, see, I’ve sent my servant Na’aman to you \add so that you can heal\add* his skin disease.”
\p
\v 7 \add However\add* when Yisrael’s king read the letter, he tore his clothes \add in despair\add*, and he said, “\add Do they think that I’m God who ends people’s lives and gives life to others? Why’s this person\add* sending a man \add here for me\add* to take away his skin disease? Surely \add he must be creating a situation so he has an excuse to attack me!\add*”
\p
\v 8 \add Later\add* when Elisha the man of God heard that Yisrael’s king had torn his clothes, he sent \add a message\add* to the king, “Why did you tear your clothes? Please, let \add that man\add* come to me \add so he can\add* know that there \em is\em* a prophet in Yisrael.”
\v 9 \add So\add* Na’aman came on his chariots and horses, and he stood at the entrance to Elisha’s house.
\v 10 Elisha sent a messenger \add out\add* to him to tell him, “Go and wash seven times in the Yordan \add river\add*, and \add then you’ll be better and your skin will go back to normal\add*.
\p
\v 11 \add But\add* Na’aman was furious, and he left, saying, “Listen, I said to myself that he’d surely come out and stand \add there\add* and call on the name of his God Yahweh, then he’d wave his hand \add over my body\add* and take away the skin disease.
\v 12 Aren’t the Damascus rivers Abanah and Pharpar better than \add any river in\add* Yisrael? Can’t I bathe in them \add instead\add* and \add get healed\add*?” \add So\add* he turned and he went \add off angrily\add*.
\v 13 Then \add some of\add* his servants \add approached him and suggested\add*, “My \add master\add*, if the prophet \add had told you to do something more significant\add*, wouldn’t you have done it? \add So maybe you could do the simple thing that\add* he told you: wash and \add get better\add*?”
\p
\v 14 \add So\add* \add Na’aman\add* went down to the Yordan river and dipped in \add it\add* seven times \add like the man of God had told him to\add*. Then his skin \add became clear again,\add* like the skin of a young boy, and he was \add healed\add*.
\v 15 Then he returned to the man of God \add along with his entire retinue\add*. \add Standing in front of him\add*, he said, “Look, please. I know that there is no God in all the earth except in Yisrael. Now, please, \add accept\add* a blessing from your servant.”
\p
\v 16 “By the life of Yahweh \add who I serve\add*,” he \add responded\add*, “I won’t take \add anything\add*.”
\p \add Na’aman\add* urged him to take \add something\add*, but he kept refusing.
\v 17 Then Na’aman said, “\add Well\add* if not, please, \add at least\add* may \add we load a pair of mules with some soil\add* \add to take back with us\add*, because \add from now on,\add* your servant will no longer make a burnt offering or a sacrifice to other gods—only to Yahweh.
\v 18 \add However,\add* \add I’ll ask in advance:\add* May Yahweh forgive your servant when my master goes to the house of \add the god\add* Rimmon to prostrate himself there, and he’s leaning on my hand, and I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon. When I prostrate myself in the house of Rimmon, please may Yahweh forgive your servant \add for this one activity\add*.”
\p
\v 19 “Go in peace,” \add Elisha\add* \add replied\add*.
\p \add After they’d gone a short distance,\add*
\v 20 Elisha’s servant said \add to himself\add*, “\add Hmmh\add*, my master \add wouldn’t take anything from that\add* Na’aman the Aramean. By the life of Yahweh, \add I think I should run after him and take something that he brought\add*.”
\v 21 \add So\add* Gehazi \add hurried\add* after Na’aman. \add When\add* Na’aman saw a person running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him, and he said, “\add Is there a problem\add*?”
\p
\v 22 “Peace,” he said, “My master sent me to tell you that two young \add prophets-in-training arrived\add* from the hill country of Efraim. \add Can we\add* please have 30kg of silver and two sets of clothing for them.”
\p
\v 23 “\add Sure\add*,” said Na’aman. “Take 60kg,” he urged him. Then he \add separated\add* 60kg of silver into two bags along with two sets of clothes, then he gave them to two of his young men \add to carry back for him\add*.
\v 24 When \add Gehazi\add* reached the hill, he sent the men back and they \add returned\add* \add to Na’aman\add*. Then he took \add the sacks that they’d brought\add* and \add hid\add* them in the house.
\v 25 \add When he went back in to\add* his master, Elisha \add asked\add* him, “\add Where did you go\add*, Gehazi?”
\p “Your servant \add hasn’t been anywhere\add*.” he \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 26 “\add Wasn’t I there in spirit when\add* a man turned from on his chariot to meet you?” \add Elisha\add* said to him, “Is this a time to take silver or clothing, or to take olive trees or vineyards, or sheep or cattle, or male or female servants?
\v 27 \add Because of that,\add* Na’aman’s leprosy will \add transfer\add* to you and to your offspring forever.” When \add Gehazi\add* \add left the room, his skin had gone white as snow and he was now a leper\add*.

\v 1 \add One day,\add* the \add prophets-in-training\add* said to Elisha, “Please look, The place where we’re sitting \add to learn from you\add* is too narrow \add to fit us all in\add*.
\v 2 Please, let us go \add down by\add* the Yordan \add river\add*, and let \add each of us cut down and bring back a log\add* from there \add to make a new classroom for us to sit in\add*.”
\p “Go \add ahead\add*,” he \add answered\add*.
\p
\v 3 One of them \add insisted\add*, “Please, \add say that you’ll\add* come with your servants.”
\p “\add Okay then,\add* I’ll come,” he said.
\v 4 \add So\add* he went with them to the Yordan valley to cut down \add some\add* trees,
\v 5 \add but\add* while one of them was chopping down a tree, suddenly the axe head separated from the handle and \add went flying\add* into the water. \add The man\add* called out to Elisha, “Oh, Master, what should I do? \add It’s not my axe\add*—I borrowed it!”
\p
\v 6 “Where did it fall in?” the man of God \add asked\add*. \add After the man had shown him the place\add*, \add Elisha\add* cut off \add a stick\add* and threw it there, and the iron \add axe head\add* \add rose to the surface\add*.
\v 7 “\add Now get it out\add*,” he said, and the man stretched out and grabbed it.
\s1 The Syrian army is defeated
\s4 Northern kingdom
\p
\v 8 \add In those days,\add* the king of Aram was fighting against Yisrael, and he’d instruct his servants, “\add Set up\add* \add our\add* camp in such and such a place.”
\v 9 \add However,\add* the man of God sent to Yisrael’s king \add to warn him\add*, “Beware of passing by such and such a place, because the Aramean \add army\add* \add will be attacking there\add*.”
\v 10 \add So\add* the king would send messengers to the people at that place \add to warn them to watch and be prepared\add*.
\p \add That happened several times\add*
\v 11 and the Aramean king \add got very upset about it\add*. He called in his servants and demanded, “\add Which one of you\add* \add is a traitor—passing military intelligence\add* to the king of Yisrael?”
\p
\v 12 “No, my master the king,” a servant \add answered\add*. “It’s the prophet Elisha in Yisrael who tells their king the things that you say \add even\add* in your bedroom.”
\p
\v 13 “Go and find out where he is,” he \add instructed\add*, “and I’ll send some \add men\add* there to capture him.”
\p “He’s in Dothan,” he was told \add later\add*.
\v 14 \add So\add* he sent chariots and horses and a large contingent, and they \add arrived there\add* at night and surrounded the town.
\p
\v 15 Early \add the next morning\add*, the man of God’s servant got up, and going outside he was \add shocked to see\add* chariots and horses and an army surrounding the town, \add so he called\add* \add Elisha\add*, “Oh, my master! What will we do?”
\p
\v 16 “Don’t \add be afraid\add*,” he said, “because \add we have many more than that on our side\add*.”
\v 17 Then Elisha prayed, “Yahweh, please \add enable\add* his \add sight so he can\add* see.” Then Yahweh \add enabled\add* the eyes of the young man, and he \add was stunned to see\add* that the hill was \add covered with\add* chariots of fire and horses all around Elisha.
\p
\v 18 \add When the Arameans approached to swoop in\add*, Elisha prayed to Yahweh, “Please, strike \add those warriors\add* with blinding light.” \add So\add* \add Yahweh\add* struck them with blinding light \add just as Elisha had requested\add*,
\v 19 and Elisha told them, “This isn’t the \add right\add* way, and this isn’t the town. \add Follow\add* me, and let me lead you to the man you’re looking for.”
\p Then he led them to Shomron \add (Samaria)\add*,
\v 20 and when they’d entered \add the city\add*, Elisha said, “Yahweh, open the eyes of these people \add so they can\add* see.” \add So\add* Yahweh opened their eyes, and then they \add were stunned to see\add* that they were in the middle of Shomron.
\p
\v 21 When he saw them, the king of Yisrael \add asked\add* Elisha, “Should I \add kill\add* them? Should I \add kill\add* them, my father?”
\v 22 “\add No,\add* don’t \add kill\add* them,” he \add replied\add*. “\add Would you cold-bloodedly kill your prisoners of war\add*? \add No,\add* \add give them\add* bread and water and \add let them\add* eat and drink, and then they can \add return\add* to their master.”
\v 23 \add So\add* \add the king\add* prepared a \add large meal\add* for them, and they ate and drank, and he sent them \add off to return\add* to their master. \add After that,\add* the Aramean troops didn’t continue \add their ventures\add* into Yisrael.
\s1 Ben-Hadad besieges Shomron/Samaria
\s4 Northern kingdom
\p
\v 24 \add Sometime after that,\add* King Ben-Hadad of Aram assembled all of his \add warriors\add* and \add attacked\add* Shomron \add (Samaria)\add*, and besieged it.
\v 25 \add Being surrounded like that\add* \add caused\add* a terrible famine inside \add the city\add*, until a donkey’s head would be \add sold for\add* eighty silver \add coins\add*, and a \add cup\add* of doves’ droppings was \add sold\add* for five silver \add coins\add*.
\p
\v 26 \add One day as\add* the king of Yisrael was \add walking past\add* on the \add top of the city\add* wall, a woman cried out to him, “Save \add me\add*, my master, the king!”
\p
\v 27 “\add If\add* Yahweh won’t save you, \add how could I possibly\add* save you?” he \add snapped\add*. “\add Some grain\add* from the threshing floor or \add some wine\add* from the winepress?”
\v 28 Then he \add asked\add* her, “\add Okay,\add* \add what’s your problem\add*?”
\p “This woman said to me, ‘\add Let’s have\add* your son and we’ll eat him today, then we’ll eat my son tomorrow,’ ” she \add answered\add*.
\v 29 “\add So\add* we boiled my son and ate him, and then the next day I said, ‘\add Hand over\add* your son and we’ll eat him,’ but she’d hidden \add him\add*.”
\p
\v 30 When he heard \add that\add*, the king (standing up on the wall) tore his clothes, and the people could see \add to their astonishment that he was wearing sackcloth underneath\add*,
\v 31 and he said, “May God do that to me and more, if Shafat’s son Elisha \add still has his head on him by the end of the day\add*.”
\p
\v 32 \add Meanwhile,\add* Elisha was sitting \add at home\add*, joined by the \add city\add* elders. \add The king\add* \add had sent a warrior ahead of him\add*, \add and before he’d arrived at the house\add*, \add Elisha\add* had told the elders, “\add Well now,\add* \add that son of a murderer has sent an assassin to separate me from\add* my head. Listen, when that \add hit-man\add* arrives, shut the door and \add lean against\add* \add it\add*. \add His master won’t be far\add* behind him.”
\v 33 He was still talking with them, when, \add wow, the warrior was coming towards the house\add* \add soon followed by the king who\add* said, “\add Listen, Yahweh caused this disaster so why should I trust\add* \add him\add* any longer?”
\c 7
\p
\v 1 “\add Listen to what Yahweh says\add*,” Elisha \add responded\add*, “Yahweh says that at this time tomorrow, a \add drum\add* of flour will be \add sold\add* for a shekel, and two \add drums\add* of barley will be \add sold for\add* for a shekel at the \add city\add* gate.”
\p
\v 2 “\add That’s impossible\add*,” \add interjected\add* the captain \add at the king’s side\add*. “Yahweh \add would have to make\add* windows in the sky.”
\p “\add Oh, it’ll happen\add*,” the man of God \add answered\add*, “\add and you’ll see it with your own eyes, but you won’t get to eat any of it\add*.”
\p
\v 3 \add That day,\add* four men \add who were isolated due to\add* a skin disease \add were at the city\add* gate, and they \add asked each other\add*, “Why are we \add just\add* sitting here until we \add starve\add*?
\v 4 If we \add go into the city, we’ll starve to death in there, but\add* if we sit here, we’ll die \add anyway\add*. \add Why don’t we go into the Aramean army camp\add*—if they kill us then we’ll die, but if they let us live, then we’ll live.”
\v 5 \add So as it was getting dark\add*, they went to go into the camp, \add but as\add* they came to the edge of \add it\add*, \add to their surprise there wasn’t a person in sight\add*.
\v 6 \add It turned out that\add* the master had caused the Aramean \add army\add* to hear the sounds of chariots and horses and a large army, \add so\add* they’d said \add to each other that the king of Yisrael must have hired the Hittite and Egyptian kings to join together to fight them\add*.
\v 7 \add As a result,\add* they’d taken off and fled in the twilight. They’d abandoned their tents and horses and donkeys—leaving the camp just as it was, and fled for their lives.
\p
\v 8 \add So\add* those \add four\add* \add men with leprosy approached\add* the edge of the camp and went \add into the first\add* tent, and ate and drank. Then they \add took some\add* gold and silver and clothes out, and they went and hid it. Then they returned and went into another tent, and \add stole some stuff\add* from that one, and went and hid that.
\v 9 Then they said \add to each other\add*, “\add We shouldn’t really be doing this today\add*. It’s a day of good news, but we’ve been \add keeping it to ourselves\add*. \add If\add* we wait until the light of the morning, \add we’ll get punished for it\add*, \add so\add* let’s go now and inform the king’s household.”
\v 10 \add So\add* they went and called out to one of the city gatekeepers, and they informed them, “We went to the Aramean camp, but listen, there \add wasn’t anyone there, or any voices\add*. The horses and donkeys were still tethered, and the tents were left just as they were.”
\p
\v 11 The gatekeepers called out, and \add the news was reported to the palace\add*.
\v 12 \add Although it was already night-time,\add* the king got up and \add warned\add* his servants, “\add I’ll tell you what’s going on here\add*: The Arameans know that we’re hungry, \add so\add* they left their camp to go and hide in the countryside, \add thinking that we’d go out from the city, and then they could capture us and take over\add* the city.”
\p
\v 13 \add But\add* one of his servants answered, “\add Sir,\add* please, let us take five of the remaining horses. \add They’re pretty much finished anyway, like the remaining\add* population of Yisrael, \add so there’s not much to lose\add*. Let us \add go and investigate\add*.”
\v 14 \add So with the king’s permission,\add* they took two chariot horses and \add went to check out\add* the Aramean camp.
\v 15 They went \add as far as\add* the Yordan \add river\add*, and \add were amazed that\add* the whole road was full of clothing and equipment that the Arameans had thrown off in their rush, and the messengers returned and informed the king.
\v 16 \add So\add* the people went out and plundered the camp. Then it happened: a \add drum\add* of fine flour was \add sold\add* for a shekel, and two \add drums\add* of barley \add for the same amount, just as Yahweh had said would happen\add*.
\p
\v 17 The king had appointed the captain who \add had argued with Elisha to be in charge at\add* the \add city\add* gate, but the people trampled him \add there\add* and he died, just as the man of God had said when the king \add had gone to his place\add*.
\v 18 When the man of God had told the king that two \add drums\add* of barley \add would be sold\add* for a shekel, and a \add drum\add* of flour \add also sold for\add* a shekel the next morning at the \add city\add* gate,
\v 19 the captain \add was the one who’d\add* answered the man of God and had said that Yahweh would have to make windows in the sky to do that, and \add Elisha\add* had told him that he’d see it, but wouldn’t be able to eat any of it.
\v 20 That’s exactly what happened, \add because\add* he got trampled by the \add rush of\add* people at the gate and died.

\v 2 \add So\add* the woman got up, and she did \add what the man of God told her\add*: She \add packed up her household and left to go and live\add* in the Philistines’ \add region\add* for seven years.
\p
\v 3 \add Then eventually after\add* seven years, the woman returned from the Philistines’ \add region\add* and she went \add to petition\add* the king \add about\add* her house and land.
\v 4 \add When she arrived,\add* the king \add had asked\add* Gehazi, the man of God’s servant, “Please tell me all the \add incredible\add* things that Elisha has done.”
\v 5 Then \add Gehazi\add* was telling the king that \add Elisha\add* had made the dead live, and how the woman who he made her son live was \add petitioning\add* the king on behalf of her house and her field. Then Gehazi \add exclaimed\add*, “My master, the king, this is the woman, and that’s her son, who Elisha made live!”
\v 6 \add So\add* the king questioned the woman and she told him \add her story\add*. Then the king appointed a court official to \add attend to her case\add*, saying, “Return everything that belongs to her \add plus the profit from her\add* field from the day she left until now.”

\v 7 Elisha went to \add Aram’s capital\add* Damascus at a time when King Ben-Hadad of Aram \add (Syria)\add* was \add very\add* sick, and someone told him that the man of God was in town.
\v 8 The king \add instructed\add* \add an official named\add* Haza’el, “Take a gift \add with you\add* and go \add and\add* meet the man of God. Then inquire from Yahweh through him \add to find out if I’ll\add* recover from this sickness.”
\v 9 \add So\add* Haza’el went to meet \add Elisha\add* and \add took presents with him loaded on\add* forty camels—\add some of\add* every good thing \add that he could find\add* in Damascus. He went and stood in front of him and \add asked\add*, “Your servant, King Ben-Hadad sent me to \add ask you if he’ll recover from his\add* sickness?”
\p
\v 10 “Go \add and\add* tell him that he’ll surely live,” Elisha \add answered\add*. “But Yahweh has shown me that he’ll definitely die.”
\v 11 Then \add Elisha\add* \add stared at him until\add* \add Haza’el\add* \add felt embarrassed\add*, and then the man of God started to cry.
\p
\v 12 “Why are you crying, my master?” Haza’el asked.
\p “Because I know what evil things you’ll do to the \add Israelis\add*,” he said. “You’ll \add burn down\add* their fortresses and kill their young men with the sword. You’ll smash their children’s \add heads on rocks\add*, and rip open \add the bellies of\add* their pregnant women.”
\p
\v 13 Haza’el \add asked\add*, “But \add how could your servant \add be in a position to\add* do such a major thing when he’s only minor, like a\add* dog \add in the palace\add*?”
\p “Yahweh has let me see you as king over Aram.” Elisha \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 14 Then he left Elisha and \add went back\add* to his master \add who asked\add* him, “What did Elisha tell you?”

\v 15 \add the very next\add* day, \add Haza’el\add* dipped \add Ben-Hadad’s\add* blanket in water and held it over his face \add until\add* he died, and then Haza’el \add started to reign\add* in his place.

\p
\v 16 In the fifth year of \add the reign of\add* Ahab’s son Yoram as king of Yisrael, Yehoshafat’s son Yehoram became king of Yehudah.
\v 17 He was thirty-two when he became king and he reigned from Yerushalem for eight years.
\v 18 He \add followed\add* in the \add evil\add* ways of the kings of \add the northern kingdom of\add* Yisrael, just as Ahab’s \add descendants\add* had done, because \add he’d married\add* \add one of\add* Ahab’s daughters. He did what Yahweh \add had said was\add* evil,
\v 19 \add but\add* Yahweh wasn’t willing to destroy Yehudah, for the sake of his servant David—he’d \add promised\add* David that \add his descendants would always rule Yehudah\add*.
\p
\v 20 \add It was\add* \add during\add* \add King Yehoram’s\add* \add time that\add* Edom rebelled from Yehudah’s \add control\add*, and they \add appointed their own king\add*.
\v 21 \add So\add* Yehoram \add took his army and\add* chariots and crossed the valley towards Zair \add in Edom\add*. \add They attacked\add* at night, \add but as the Edomite army and chariots started to\add* surround them, \add they\add* \add had to\add* \add retreat back\add* to their tents.
\v 22 \add So\add* Edom has been out from under the control of Yehudah to this day. Then Livnah revolted at the same time.
\p
\v 23 \add Everything else that Yehoram said and did is written in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Yehudah.
\v 24 Then Yehoram \add died\add* and was buried with his ancestors in the city of David, and his son Ahazyah \add replaced him as king\add*.

\v 26 Ahazyah was twenty-two when he became king, and he \add reigned from Yerushalem for\add* one year. (His mother’s name was Atalyah \add (Athaliah)\add*, the daughter of King Omri of Yisrael.)
\v 27 He \add followed Ahab’s customs\add* and did what Yahweh \add had said was\add* evil like Ahab’s descendants, because he was a son-in-law of \add a descendant\add* of Ahab.

\v 29 King Yoram returned to Yizre’el \add (Jezreel)\add* to \add recover\add* from the wounds that Arameans had \add given\add* him at Ramah when he’d fought with Aram’s King Haza’el. \add Later,\add* King Ahazyah of Yehudah (Yehoram’s son), went down to see (Ahab’s son) Yoram in Yizre’el because he was wounded.

\v 1 Then the prophet Elisha called to one of the \add prophets-in-training\add* and told him, “\add Tuck your robe in\add*, take this flask of oil, and \add hurry\add* to Ramot-Gilead.
\v 2 \add When you get\add* there, you’ll see Yehu \add (Jehu)\add* (the son of Nimshi’s son Yehoshafat) there. \add Take him into a private inner room, away from\add* his brothers,
\v 3 and pour \add some of\add* the olive oil over his head and tell him that Yahweh says that he’s anointed him as king over Yisrael. Then open the door and \add get out of there fast\add*.”
\v 4 \add So\add* the young prophet went to Ramot-Gilead,
\v 5 and \add when he arrived, he was surprised to see\add* the army captains sitting there. He said, “\add I need to talk to\add* you, captain.”
\p “\add Which one of us\add*?” Yehu \add asked\add*.
\p “\add It’s a message for\add* \em you\em*, captain,” he said.
\v 6 \add So\add* \add Yehu\add* got up, and \add went over\add* to the house \add where\add* \add the prophet\add* poured the oil on his head and told him, “Yisrael’s God Yahweh says that he’s anointed you as king over Yahweh’s people—over Yisrael.
\v 7 You should attack the house of Ahab your master so \add Yahweh\add* can avenge the \add murder\add* of his servants, the prophets, and \add avenge\add* the \add murder\add* of all his servants \add who were killed by\add* Izevel \add (Jezebel)\add*.
\v 8 All of Ahab’s household \add should be killed\add*, and \add Yahweh\add* \add won’t allow any of his male descendants to live, either before or after they’ve left home\add*.
\v 9 \add Yahweh\add* \add wants Ahab’s descendants to be eliminated like the descendants of Nebat’s son Yarave’am and Ahiyah’s son Baasha were\add*.
\v 10 The dogs will eat Izevel’s \add body\add* \add where she dies in\add* Yizre’el—\add she won’t be buried\add*.” Then he opened the door and \add rushed away\add*.
\p
\v 11 \add When\add* Yehu came back \add to the room where\add* the servants of his masters were, and \add they\add* \add asked\add* him, “\add Is everything okay\add*? \add What did that madman want with\add* you?”
\p “You yourselves know \add that man and the sort of stuff that he says\add*,” he said.
\p
\v 12 “\add You’re lying\add*,” they insisted. “Tell us \add what he told you\add*.”
\p “\add Well,\add* he said \add several things\add*,” \add Yehu\add* \add answered\add*, “\add and then he told me that Yahweh says he’s\add* anointed me as king over Yisrael.”
\p
\v 13 Then they all spread their cloaks on the steps of the building \add for Yehu to walk out on\add*, and they blew a trumpet and \add shouted\add*, “Yehu is \add now\add* the king!”
\s1 The killing of Yoram and Ahazyah

\p
\v 14 \add So\add* Yehu (the son of Nimshi’s son, Yehoshafat) conspired against Yoram. Yoram was \add busy\add* \add with the army\add* guarding Ramot-Gilead from King Haza’el of Aram.
\v 15 Then King Yoram returned to Yizre’el to heal from the wounds from the Arameans when he’d fought with their King Haza’el.
\p \add So\add* Yehu told \add his men\add*, “If \add you all want me as king, then don’t let anyone leave\add* this city \add of Ramot-Gilead\add* \add in case they go to Yizre’el city and tell them\add* \add our plans\add*.”
\v 16 Then Yehu rode to Yizre’el \add himself\add* because Yoram \add was recuperating there in bed\add*, and King Ahazyah had gone up \add north\add* from Yehudah to visit \add him\add*.
\p
\v 17 The watchman was standing on the watchtower in Yizre’el, and he could see Yehu’s party \add in the distance\add* as they \add began approaching\add* \add the city\add*, and he \add reported\add*, “I can see a \add large group\add*.”
\p \add King\add* Yoram \add ordered\add*, “\add Send out a chariot and go and ask them if they’re coming in peace\add*.”
\v 18 \add So\add* the horse and chariot went \add out to meet them and called out\add*, “The king \add wants to know if you’re all coming in\add* peace?”
\p \add But\add* Yehu \add answered\add*, “What’s \add that got to do with you\add*? Turn around \add and follow us\add*.”
\p \add Meanwhile\add* the watchman \add announced\add*, “The messenger has \add met\add* them, but he isn’t returning.”
\p
\v 19 \add So\add* \add the king\add* sent out a second horse and chariot, and he \add approached\add* and \add asked\add*, “\add The king wants to know if you’re all coming in\add* peace?”
\p \add Again\add* Yehu \add replied\add*, “What’s \add that got to do with you\add*? Turn around \add and follow us\add*.”
\p
\v 20 Then the watchman declared, “He \add also\add* \add met with them but didn’t return\add*. \add The leader is riding\add* like Nimshi’s son Yehu, because he’s riding \add like crazy\add*.”
\p
\v 21 “\add Quick,\add* get \add my chariot ready!\add*” Yoram \add ordered\add*. \add They\add* harnessed his chariot and King Yoram of Yisrael and Yehudah’s King Ahazyah \add both\add* went out—each man in his chariot. They went out to \add meet\add* Yehu and they found him at Navot’s field (the Yizre’elite).
\v 22 When Yoram saw Yehu, he \add asked\add*, “\add Have you come in\add* peace, Yehu?”
\p “How \add could there be\add* peace,” he \add answered\add*, “\add when your mother Izevel is serving idols and embracing witchcraft\add*?”
\p
\v 23 Then Yoram \add swung the chariot reigns around\add* and fled, \add shouting\add* to Ahazyah, “\add It’s treason\add*, Ahazyah!”
\v 24 Yehu \add grabbed his\add* bow, and the arrow struck Yoram between his \add shoulder blades\add* and came out from his heart, and he slumped down \add dead\add* in his chariot.
\v 25 Then \add Yehu\add* said to his third officer Bidkar, “\add Pick up his body and throw it out into\add* the field of Navot, the Yizre’elite. \add I’m sure you remember how\add* you and I were riding as pairs after his father Ahab, when Yahweh \add said this\add* against him:
\v 26 ‘Yesterday I saw Navot and his sons \add killed here\add*, declared Yahweh, and I will repay you in this \add very place\add*, declares Yahweh.’ \add So now, throw his body down here because Yahweh declared that it would happen\add*.”
\p
\v 27 Yehudah’s King Ahazyah saw \add that happen\add*, and he \add sped away through the garden by a\add* house \add with Yehu chasing after him shouting\add*, “\add Get him too in his chariot when he starts climbing upwards to\add* Gur near Yibleam.” \add So as\add* he fled towards Megiddo, he \add was killed\add* there,
\v 28 and his servants \add took his body\add* to Yerushalem, \add where\add* they buried him in his ancestral tomb in the City of David.

\p
\v 30 Then Yehu came to Yizre’el and \add Queen\add* Izevel \add (Jezebel)\add* heard \add about it\add*. She \add painted her eyelids\add* and \add did her hair nicely\add*, then she looked \add down\add* through the window,
\v 31 and \add when\add* Yehu came in the gate, she said, “Greetings, Zimri \add the second\add*,\x + \xo 9:31: \xt 1Ki 16:10.\x* murderer of his master.”
\v 32 \add Yehu\add* \add looked up at\add* the window and \add called out\add*, “Who is with me? Who?” And two or three servants \add poked their heads out windows and\add* looked down to him.
\v 33 “\add Okay,\add*” he \add called up\add*, “\add toss her out\add*!”
\p \add So\add* they tossed her \add out the window\add*, and some of her blood splashed onto the wall and onto the horses \add as she was trampled by them\add*.
\v 34 Then \add Yehu\add* \add and his men\add* went in and ate and drank, and then he said, “\add Now,\add* you all better attend to that \add evil\add* woman and bury her, because she’s a king’s daughter.”
\v 35 \add But when\add* they went to bury her, they \add could only find\add* her skull and her hands and feet.
\v 36 They \add came back inside\add* and told him, “It’s just like what Yahweh said via his servant the Tishbite Eliyyah, when he said that the dogs would eat Izevel’s flesh \add just outside\add* Yizre’el,
\v 37 and then \add her\add* body would become like dung on the \add ground and no one would be able to recognise her specific bones\add*.”

\s1 Ahab’s descendants are eliminated
\s4 Northern kingdom
\p
\v 1 \add King\add* Ahab had seventy sons who lived in Shomron \add (Samaria)\add*, \add so\add* Yehu sent letters to the leaders and elders of Yizre’el, and to the guardians of Ahab’s children, saying,
\v 2 “When you all \add receive\add* this letter, \add you’ll have\add* the sons of your masters \add with you, as well as\add* chariots and horses, and weapons \add within your\add* fortified city.
\v 3 \add So select\add* the best and the most honest one out of your masters’ sons \add or nephews\add*, and \add establish\add* him on his father’s throne, and then \add be prepared to defend your masters’ family\add*.”
\v 4 \add But\add* they were extremely frightened and said, “Listen—those two kings couldn’t stand \add against Yehu, so how could\add* we?”
\v 5 Then the man who was \add now\add* in charge of the household and leading the city elders sent \add a message\add* to Yehu, “We are your servants and we’ll do whatever you tell us to. We don’t \add plan to select a\add* king. Do \add whatever you think best\add*.”
\p
\v 6 \add So\add* \add Yehu\add* \add sent\add* a second letter saying, “If you’re all \add on my side and ready to follow\add* me, come and meet me at Yizre’el tomorrow with the heads of your masters’ sons.”
\p \add The late King Ahab had\add* seventy sons \add who were being brought up by the city leaders\add*,
\v 7 and when that letter \add arrived\add*, they killed and beheaded all of them, put the heads in baskets, and sent them to him at Yizre’el.
\p
\v 8 A messenger went and informed \add Yehu\add* that the heads had been brought, and he instructed them to pile them up in two piles at the \add city\add* gate until the next morning.
\v 9 In the morning he went out and stood there, and he told all the people, “You are innocent. Listen—it was me myself who conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all these?
\v 10 \add You all should\add* know that \add when Yahweh says something will happen, then it will happen\add*. \add He\add* \add said via his servant Eliyyah that this is what would happen to Ahab’s family, and so it has\add*.”
\v 11 Then Yehu \add killed all Ahab’s remaining family members\add* in Yizre’el, and all \add his chosen leaders, and his associates\add* and priests, leaving no survivors.
\s1 The relatives of Ahazyah are killed

\p
\v 12 Then \add Yehu\add* left \add Yizre’el\add* and headed towards Shomron \add (Samaria)\add*. \add When he reached\add* the shepherds’ shearing house,
\v 13 \add he\add* \add met\add* the \add late\add* King Ahazyah’s brothers \add there\add*, and he \add asked\add* \add them\add*, “Who are you?”
\p “We’re \add King\add* Ahazyah’s brothers,” they said, “and we’re coming \add to look after\add* the sons of the king and of the queen mother.”
\p
\v 14 “\add Arrest\add* them,” he \add ordered\add*, so they \add grabbed\add* and slaughtered them near the pit at the shearing house. There were forty-two men and \add none were spared\add*.
\s1 All Ahab’s other relatives are killed

\p
\v 15 Then \add continuing on\add* from there, \add Yehu\add* found Rekav’s son Yonadav \add coming\add* to meet him. \add Yehu\add* \add greeted him and asked\add*, “\add Are you wanting to do what is right just like I am\add*?” IS THAT WHAT HE WAS REALLY ASKING???
\p “\add Yes,\add* \add I am\add*.” Yonadav \add replied\add*.
\p “\add Great\add*,” \add Yehu\add* said. “Give me your hand,” and he gave him his hand, and \add Yehu\add* \add pulled him up to join him\add* in the chariot,
\v 16 telling \add him\add*, “Come with me and see my zeal for Yahweh.” \add So they rode together in the\add* chariot.
\v 17 \add When they got\add* to Shomron, \add Yehu\add* \add killed the remainder of Ahab’s family who were there\add*, until \add they were finally\add* exterminated, \add just as Yahweh had said via\add* Eliyyah.
\p
\v 18 Then Yehu assembled all the people and told them, “Ahab served Baal a little, \add but\add* Yehu will serve him \add a lot\add*.
\v 19 \add So\add* now, call all the prophets of Baal to come here—all his servants and all his priests. Don’t let \add anyone stay away because I’m going to make\add* a large sacrifice to Baal. \add Anyone who’s absent will be executed\add*.” \add However\add* Yehu \add was being\add* cunning in order to destroy Baal’s \add followers\add*.
\v 20 Yehu \add ordered\add*, “\add Announce a special holiday to assemble\add* \add and worship\add* Baal,” and \add so they did\add*.
\v 21 \add On that day,\add* Yehu brought in all \add the people\add*, and all the servants of the Baal came, \add leaving no one out\add*. They entered the \add temple\add* of the Baal and \add it\add* was \add packed full\add*.
\v 22 He \add told the wardrobe supervisor\add*, “Bring out \add uniforms\add* for all the servants of the Baal,” so he brought robes out for them.
\v 23 Then Yehu and Rekav’s son Yonadab entered the \add temple\add* of the Baal and \add instructed\add* the servants of the Baal, “\add Make sure that it’s only the servants of Baal in here—we don’t want any\add* servants of Yahweh.”
\v 24 \add So\add* they entered to make sacrifices and burnt offerings.
\p \add Meanwhile,\add* Yehu \add had stationed\add* eighty men outside, and had told \add them\add*, “\add Don’t let any of the ones I send you escape, or it will be \em your\em* life in place of theirs\add*.”
\p
\v 25 Then when he finished making the burnt offering \add in the outer area\add*, Yehu told the \add guards\add* and officers, “\add Come in now and\add* strike them \add down\add*. Don’t let \add any of them get\add* out.” \add So\add* they \add attacked them with swords\add*, and the \add guards\add* and officers threw \add the bodies over the fence\add*. Then they went \add inside the temple\add*,
\v 26 and pulled the \add sacred posts\add* outside and burnt \add them\add*.
\v 27 They broke down the pillar of the Baal, and they broke down the \add temple\add*. \add Since then it’s been used as an out-house\add*.
\p
\v 28 \add That’s how\add* Yehu \add put an end to Baal worship in\add* Yisrael.
\v 29 \add There was only one of the things with which Nebat’s son Yarave’am had caused Yisrael to sin that Yehu didn’t destroy\add*: the golden calves at Beyt-El and Dan.
\v 30 Then Yahweh told Yehu, “Because you did good by \add following my principles and doing what I’ve said is right, including what you did to Ahab’s family, you’ll have four generations sitting on Yisrael’s throne\add*.”
\v 31 \add But\add* Yehu didn’t take care \add to follow the instructions of Yisrael’s God Yahweh whole-heartedly\add*—he didn’t \add reject all of Yarave’am’s evil customs\add* which had caused Yisrael to sin.

\v 32 \add During that period\add*, Yahweh began to \add reduce the size of Yisrael’s territory\add* and \add Aram’s King\add* Haza’el \add attacked along their border\add*

\s1 Queen Ataliya’s reign over Yehudah

\r (2 Chr. 22:10–23:15)
\p
\v 1 When Ahazyah’s mother Atalyah saw that her son \add had been killed\add*, she went and had all \add of his descendants executed so that none of them could claim the throne\add*.
\v 2 \add However,\add* King Yehoram’s daughter Yehosheva took Yoash, the son of her sister Ahazyah, and hid him in the bedroom along with his wet-nurse. \add Although he was on the list of\add* the king’s sons to be executed, they hid him from Atalyah, and \add so\add* he wasn’t killed.
\v 3 Then he was able to stay hidden with her in the \add temple\add* for the six years while Atalyah ruled \add Yehudah\add*.
\p
\v 4 In the seventh year, Yehoyada \add the priest\add* sent for the \add officers over the royal bodyguards and the palace bodyguards to come to him inside Yahweh’s temple\add*. \add He made them agree to take an oath of\add* \add secrecy and loyalty\add* \add in the temple, then he let them\add* see the king’s son.
\v 5 Then he commanded them, “This is \add what you all need to\add* do: On the Rest Day, one third of you \add must go and guard the king’s palace\add*.
\v 6 The \add second\add* third \add must guard\add* the Sur gate, and \add the remainder must stay behind the others roaming back and forth\add*,
\v 7 and the two \add off-duty groups must guard the temple and protect\add* the \add young\add* king.
\v 8 You’ll surround the king—each man \add holding his weapons at the ready right around him\add*—killing any person who approaches your ranks, and \add accompanying\add* the king when he goes out or comes in.
\p
\v 9 \add So the officers over the royal bodyguards\add* did \add everything\add* that the priest Yehoyada had commanded. \add Both the on-duty and the off-duty men fulfilled their roles under Yehoyada’s direction that Rest Day\add*.
\v 10 The priest had \add taken\add* the spears and the shields out of the temple that had belonged to King David and given them to the \add officers over the royal bodyguards\add*,
\v 11 and \add they all stood in position\add*, each man holding his weapons ready in his hand, \add right around the palace and the temple\add* and the altar, and the king.
\v 12 Then \add the priest\add* brought \add young\add* Yoash out and put the crown on his head. He \add handed him the official scroll\add*, and they anointed him and made him king. Then they \add clapped their hands and shouted\add*, “\add Long\add* live the king!”
\p
\v 13 \add When\add* Atalyah heard the sound of the people \add and the guards\add*, she came to the people \add gathered\add* at Yahweh’s temple
\v 14 and \add was stunned to see\add* the \add young, new\add* king standing near the pillar as was the custom, with the captains and the trumpeters near the king, and all the people of the land rejoicing and \add sounding\add* trumpets. Then Atalyah tore her clothes and \add shouted\add* out, “Treachery! Treason!”
\v 15 Then Yehoyada the priest commanded the \add officials over the bodyguards and the army officers\add*, “Bring her out away from \add these public buildings\add*. Don’t kill her in the temple, but kill anyone who \add tries to rescue\add* her.
\v 16 \add So\add* they \add grabbed her by each arm and took her out through the entrance for the horses to the palace\add*, and she was \add executed\add* there.

\v 17 Then Yehoyada \add led the making of an agreement\add* between Yahweh and the king and the people, \add for the people to serve\add* Yahweh, and \add also\add* between the king and between the people.
\v 18 Then people \add from all over the country went to the temple\add* of Baal and broke down the altars.

\s1 Yoash reigns over Yehudah
\s4 Southern kingdom
\r (2 Chr. 23:16-23)
\p
\v 1 Yoash became king in Yerushalem in the seventh year of Yehu’s \add reign over Israel\add*. (His mother was Tsivyah from Beer-Sheva.) He reigned for forty years
\v 2 and all his life, \add he\add* did \add what Yahweh had said was correct\add* because he was instructed by Yehoyada the priest.
\v 3 \add However,\add* they didn’t remove the \add hilltop shrines\add* where the people continued sacrificing and burning incense.
\p
\v 4 Then Yoash told the priests, “\add You all must collect\add* all the \add money that’s donated to Yahweh’s temple, whether it’s the money they’re required to pay or the money that they themselves decide to give as sacred offerings to buy things for the temple\add*.
\v 5 \add Each priest must bring what they’ve collected from their acquaintances, and use it to make repairs wherever they find that there’s been damage to the temple\add*.”
\p
\v 6 \add However,\add* \add when\add* the priests \add still\add* hadn’t repaired the damaged portions by the twenty-third year of Yoash’s reign,
\v 7 \add he\add* sent for Yehoyada the priest and the \add other\add* priests, and \add questioned\add* them, “Why aren’t you all strengthening the \add temple where it was damaged\add*? \add From now on, you all won’t take any money from acquaintances, but you’ll give it directly for repairing the damage\add*.”
\v 8 \add So\add* the priests agreed to not accept \add money\add* from the people, and \add that they themselves wouldn’t be the ones to repair the temple\add*.
\p
\v 9 Then Yehoyada the priest took a \add wooden\add* chest and he made a hole in \add the top\add*, and he \add placed\add* it at the right of the altar. When a person came into the \add temple\add*, the priests guarding the \add entrance\add* would \add place any donated money into the chest\add*.
\v 10 \add Whenever they noticed the chest getting full\add*, the king’s secretary and the high priest \add would go and count the money as they bagged it up\add*.
\v 11 They \add used the funds to pay the supervisors and inspectors and the tradesmen doing the repair work\add*: carpenters and builders,
\v 12 and \add the masons and stone-cutters\add*. \add They also paid for the timber and stones, and everything else that was needed for the temple repairs\add*.
\v 13 However, \add they didn’t use the donated silver coins that were brought to the temple to make silver bowls, snuffers, basins, or trumpets, or for any other gold or silver instruments within the temple\add*,
\v 14 because they \add passed on the donations\add* to the people doing the work, and \add in this way Yahweh’s residence got repaired\add*.
\v 15 They didn’t audit the men who \add took the silver coins to the workers because the whole system was based on trust\add*.
\v 16 The silver \add coins that came as part\add* of the guilt offering and the sin offerings were not \add used for temple repairs\add*—they belonged to the priests.
\p
\v 17 Then Aram’s King Haza’el \add attacked\add* Gat and captured it, \add after which\add* \add he\add* \add decided to attack Yerushalem\add*.
\v 18 Yehudah’s King Yoash took all the sacred things that his ancestors Yehoshafat and Yehoram and Ahazyah, the \add previous\add* kings of Yehudah, had consecrated and his sacred things, and all of the gold that was found in Yahweh’s \add temple\add* treasuries and in the king’s \add palace\add*, and he sent them to Aram’s King Haza’el \add who then cancelled his planned attack on\add* Yerushalem.

\p
\v 5 \add Once he was firmly established as king\add*, \add Amatsyah\add* had the servants executed who had assassinated his father Yoash,\x + \xo 14:5 \xt 12:20-21.\x*
\v 6 \add but\add* he didn’t have their sons executed, because in the scroll where Mosheh had written the laws, Yahweh had commanded, “Fathers shouldn’t be executed for what their sons do, nor should sons be executed for the crimes of their ancestors—rather an individual should only be executed for their own crime.”
\p
\v 7 \add He led the victory over\add* ten thousand Edomites in the Salt Valley, seizing Sela in the battle and renaming it as Yokthe’el which it’s still called today.
\p
\v 8 Then Amatsyah sent messengers to Yisrael’s King Yehoash (the son of Yehoahaz, the son of Yehu) \add challenging\add*, “Come on, let’s \add have it out with each other\add*.”
\v 9 \add But\add* King Yehoash \add replied\add* to Yehudah’s King Amatsyah, “The thistle that was in the Lebanon \add forest\add* sent to the cedar that was in the Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as a wife.’ \add But\add* a \add wild\add* animal that was in the Lebanon passed by and it trampled the thistle.

\v 7 That happened because the \add Israelis\add* had sinned against their God Yahweh who had rescued them from King Far-oh in Egypt. They had \add sinned by\add* worshipping other gods
\v 8 and \add imitating the customs of the people groups\add* who Yahweh had driven out of the country ahead of them. \add They had also followed their kings\add* \add in doing evil things\add*.
\v 9 The \add Israelis\add* had done things secretly that their God Yahweh \add had said weren’t right\add*, and they’d built \add hilltop shrines everywhere from the largest fortified cities to the smallest towns\add*.
\v 10 They’d \add also\add* erected stone pillars \add to honour gods\add* and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every large tree,\x + \xo 17:10: \xt 1Ki 14:23.\x*
\v 11 and they’d burnt incense there on all \add those hilltops\add* \add just\add* like the \add people groups\add* that Yahweh \add had driven off the land ahead of them\add*—doing those evil things had made Yahweh angry.
\v 12 They’d served idols even when Yahweh had \add forbidden them\add* from doing that.

\v 13 \add So\add* Yahweh had warned Yisrael and Yehudah by the \add proclamations\add* of all of his prophets who said, “Turn from your evil ways and \add obey\add* my commands and statutes, \add following\add* all of the \add instructions that I gave\add* your ancestors and which I delivered to you \add through\add* my servants, the prophets.”
\v 14 \add However,\add* they hadn’t listened and had \add hardened their attitudes\add* \add just\add* like their ancestors who \add wouldn’t put their\add* trust in their God Yahweh.
\v 15 They rejected his statutes and the agreement that he \add made\add* with their ancestors, and \add the warning that he gave\add* them. They \add chose to worship lifeless objects\add*, and they became \add hollow and empty themselves, just like\add* \add the people of\add* the \add surrounding\add* countries which Yahweh had commanded them not to \add imitate\add*.
\v 16 They \add disobeyed the instructions given to them by\add* their God Yahweh \add by molding two metal\add* calves for themselves and making an Asherah pole. Then they \add bowed down and worshipped the sun, moon, and stars\add*, and they served Baal.\x + \xo 17:16: \xt 1Ki 12:28.\x*
\v 17 They \add sacrificed their sons and daughters, and used fortune-tellers and witchcraft—making themselves slaves to evil\add* by doing what Yahweh \add had forbidden, and so\add* making him angry.\x + \xo 17:17: \xt Deu 18:10.\x*
\v 18 \add So\add* \add that’s why\add* Yahweh had become very angry at \add the northern kingdom of\add* Yisrael and \add caused them to be removed from the land\add*. Only \add the Southern kingdom of\add* Yehudah \add remained\add*,
\v 19 \add but even they\add* didn’t \add obey the commands\add* of their God Yahweh, \add but copied much of the bad behaviour of the northern kingdom\add*.
\v 20 \add So\add* Yahweh rejected all the \add Israelis\add* and he \add caused them to suffer, including being plundered by enemy armies, until he banished them from his presence\add*.
\p
\v 21 \add Firstly he’d torn the northern kingdom out from the leadership of David’s descendants\add* and they’d made Nebat’s son Yarave’am king. Then Yarave’am had driven them away from following Yahweh, and had \add induced them into serious sin\add*.
\v 22 \add So\add* the \add Israelis had followed Yarave’am into sin\add* and then didn’t \add turn away from it\add*,
\v 23 \add and finally\add* Yahweh had removed \add the people of the northern kingdom of\add* Yisrael from \add his presence just like he’d warned he would through the messages\add* of his servants, the prophets. \add So the people\add* were deported to Assyria \add where they remain\add* to this day.
\s1 The Assyrians settle in the northern kingdom

\p
\v 24 Then the Assyrian king sent people from Babylon and from Kutah and from Avva and from Hamat and Sefarvayim, and he settled them in the cities of \add the northern kingdom\add* in place of the \add Israelis\add*. And they possessed Shomron \add (Samaria)\add* and lived in its towns.
\v 25 \add At first the new inhabitants living there didn’t respect\add* Yahweh, \add however\add* \add he\add* sent lions among them and they \add started\add* killing them.
\v 26 They told the Assyrian king, “The \add people groups\add* that you exiled \add from their own countries\add* and settled in the towns around Shomron, don’t know the customs of the God of the land. \add So\add* he’s sent lions against them, and look at them—killing them because they don’t know the customs of the God of the land.”
\v 27 “\add Send\add* one of the priests back that was brought from there,” the Assyrian king commanded. “He can go back there and settle there \add again\add*, then he can teach them the customs of the God of that place.”
\v 28 \add So\add* they found one of the priests who had been exiled from Shomron and sent him back \add to Israel\add*. He settled in Beyt-El and taught the people how Yahweh \add wanted to be\add* served.
\p
\v 29 \add But each people group\add* had made their own gods and put them in the \add hilltop shrines\add* that the \add Israelis\add* had made \add before being exiled\add*. \add Each people group did that in the area where they’d been resettled\add*.
\v 30 \add Those from\add* Babylon made \add their god\add* Succot-Benot, \add those from\add* Kutah made Nergal, \add those from\add* Hamat made \add their god\add* Ashima,
\v 31 and the Avvites made Nivhaz and Tartak. The Sefarvites \add sacrificed\add* their \add own\add* sons in the fire to \add their\add* gods Adrammelek and Anammelek.
\v 32 \add At the same time,\add* they \add tried placating\add* Yahweh, \add but\add* they \add also\add* made their own priests to make sacrifices for them in their \add hilltop shrines\add*.
\v 33 \add So\add* they were \add worshipping\add* Yahweh along with their \add own\add* gods—they’d brought those customs with them from the countries they’d been exiled from
\v 34 and which they \add still\add* follow to this day.\x + \xo 17:34: \xt Gen 32:28; 35:10.\x*
\p They’re not \add actually\add* \add obeying\add* Yahweh \add because\add* they’re not \add obeying the statutes or laws, or instructions or behaviour\add* that Yahweh commanded the descendants of Yakob (who he’d renamed to ‘Yisrael’).
\v 35 Yahweh had \add made an agreement with them\add* and had commanded them, “You all must not \add honour\add* other gods or \add bow\add* to them. You all must not serve them or sacrifice to them.\x + \xo 17:35: \xt Exo 20:5; Deu 5:9.\x*
\v 36 \add Only\add* \add serve\add* Yahweh who \add used his incredible power to rescue\add* you all out of Egypt. \add Honour\add* him, and \add only\add* bow to him and sacrifice to him.\x + \xo 17:36: \xt Deu 6:13.\x*
\v 37 \add Always\add* take care to obey the statutes and customs, and the law and the instructions that he wrote for you, and you all must not \add honour\add* other gods.
\v 38 Don’t forget the agreement that I made with you all, and don’t \add honour\add* other gods—
\v 39 \add only\add* your God Yahweh, and then he himself will rescue you from all your enemies.”
\v 40 \add However,\add* they didn’t listen, \add preferring to follow the customs from their former places of residence\add*.
\p
\v 41 \add So\add* those \add people groups honoured\add* Yahweh, but also served their idols. \add This continued through the generations with their descendants continuing the same behaviour\add*.

\s1 Hizkiyah’s reign over Yehudah

\p
\v 1 In the third year of Elah’s son King Hoshea’s \add reign\add* over Yisrael, Ahaz’s son Hizkiyah \add (Hezekiah)\add* became king of Yehudah.
\v 2 He was twenty-five when he became king and he reigned from Yerushalem for twenty-nine years. (His mother was Zekaryah’s daughter Abi.)
\v 3 He did what Yahweh \add had said was correct behaviour\add* like his ancestor \add King\add* David had done.
\v 4 He \add demolished the hilltop shrines\add* and shattered their pillars, and he cut down the Asherah \add poles\add*. He crushed the bronze serpent that Mosheh had made, because the \add Israelis\add* had named it ‘Nehushtan’ and had been offering incense to it until then.\x + \xo 18:4: \xt Num 21:9.\x*
\v 5 \add Hizkiyah\add* \add fully\add* trusted in Yisrael’s God Yahweh, and no other \add king\add* was like him among all the kings of Yehudah that \add either preceded or followed\add* him.
\v 6 He \add relied completely\add* on Yahweh—not turning away from \add following\add* him, and he \add obeyed\add* the \add instructions\add* that Yahweh had commanded Mosheh.
\v 7 \add So\add* Yahweh \add helped\add* him and he \add was successful in everything he did\add*. He rebelled against the Assyrian king and \add refused to submit to his demands\add*.
\v 8 He \add attacked and defeated\add* the Philistines as far as Gaza and its borders—\add both the smaller towns\add* and the fortified city.
\p
\v 9 Then in the fourth year of King Hizkiyah’s reign (it was the seventh year of Elah’s son Hoshea’s \add reign\add* over Yisrael), the Assyrian King Shalmaneser \add had attacked\add* Shomron \add (Samaria)\add* and \add besieged\add* it.
\v 10 They \add had finally\add* captured \add the city\add* \add after\add* three years. That was the sixth year of Hizkiyah’s \add reign over Yehudah\add* and the ninth year of Hoshea’s \add reign\add* over Yisrael.
\v 11 \add So\add* that was when the Assyrian king had exiled \add the people of\add* \add the northern kingdom of Yisrael\add* to Halah and to Havor along the Gozan River, and to the cities of the Medes.
\v 12 \add That happened\add* because they didn’t \add obey\add* their God Yahweh, but \add instead\add* they \add broke the agreement with him\add*—everything that Yahweh’s servant Mosheh had commanded. They didn’t take \add notice of it\add* and they didn’t \add obey it\add*.

\p
\v 13 In the fourteenth year of King Hizkiyah’s \add reign\add*, Assyrian King Sanheriv \add attacked\add* all the fortified cities in Yehudah and captured them.
\v 14 \add So\add* King Hizkiyah of Yehudah sent \add messengers\add* to the Assyrian king at Lakish, saying, “I \add apologise for my mistake\add*. \add Stop attacking\add* me \add and\add* \add I’ll give you whatever you demand of us\add*.” Then the Assyrian king \add demanded a tribute\add* of \add ten tonnes of gold and ten tonnes of silver\add*.
\v 15 \add So\add* Hizkiyah gave him all the silver out of the \add temple\add* and from the \add palace treasuries\add*.
\v 16 He cut the doors off Yahweh’s temple and the pillars that he’d overlaid \add gold onto\add*, and gave them to the Assyrian king.
\p
\v 17 \add However,\add* the Assyrian king \add still\add* sent his general and \add some of his top officials\add* from Lakish to King Hizkiyah in Yerushalem. They \add arrived at\add* Yerushalem with a large army and \add camped by the aquifer supplying\add* the upper pool that was \add near the field where the people washed their clothes\add*.
\v 18 They called out to the king, and Hilkiyyah’s son Elyakim who was \add the palace manager\add*, and the scribe Shebna, and Asaf’s son Yoah the secretary, went out to them.
\p
\v 19 Then the top \add Assyrian\add* commander said to them, “Now, tell Hizkiyah \add that the great Assyrian king asks him who he think’s he’s trusting in\add*.
\v 20 He claims to be powerful enough to fight us. Who is he trusting to help you all \add that gives you confidence\add* to rebel against us?
\v 21 Listen, \add your king’s\add* trusting in a \add broken stick\add* to lean on \add which will just splinter and pierce his hand\add*. That’s what King Far-oh of Egypt is like to everyone who \add puts their\add* trust in him.
\v 22 \add Ah,\add* but he might tell me that he’s trusting in your god Yahweh to help you all. If so, I’d ask him if he isn’t the one whose \add hilltop shrines\add* King Hizkiyah demolished when he told you people in Yerushalem and all Yehudah that you have to worship at the altar there?
\p
\v 23 “\add So now ask your king if he’ll make a deal\add* with my master, the king of Assyria: He’ll give you two thousand horses, \add on the condition that you can supply\add* two thousand horsemen who can ride them.
\v 24 \add If you can’t do that,\add* \add how could you all possibly repel even one of our army units\add*? \add Haha,\add* but \add of course\add* you trust in Egypt \add to supply\add* chariots and horsemen.
\v 25 \add Do you think that we’ve come here to destroy this place without Yahweh’s permission\add*? \add No, no,\add* \add it was Yahweh himself who told us to attack and destroy you\add*.”
\p
\v 26 \add But\add* Elyakim and Shebna and Yoah asked the Assyrian commander, “Please speak Aramaic to your servants because \add we understand it\add*. Don’t speak \add our language because our people on the nearby city wall will be able to understand it\add*.”
\p
\v 27 “\add Ha ha,\add* \add do you think my master sent this message just to you three and your king\add*?” he \add replied\add*. “\add No,\add* \add don’t you think that this message is also for the hungry people\add* sitting on the wall \add who’ll soon have to\add* eat their own dung and drink their own urine along with you?”
\p
\v 28 Then \add he\add* stood up and called out loudly in \add Hebrew\add*, “\add Everyone\add* \add listen to what the great king from Assyria says\add*:
\v 29 \add He’s warning you all not to let Hizkiyah deceive you, because he’s unable to save you all from our army\add*.
\v 30 And don’t let him force you all to trust in Yahweh \add thinking that we won’t capture your city and that Yahweh will somehow rescue you all\add*.
\v 31 Don’t listen to Hizkiyah because the Assyrian king is \add offering you all a chance to come out of the city and surrender. In exchange for saving me some trouble, you’ll be able to drink fresh water again and enjoy the fruit off your own trees\add* \add out here\add*
\v 32 until \add he comes here\add*. Then \add he’ll take you to another country\add* like your own—with grain and wine, and bread and vineyards, olive oil and honey. \add That way\add* you’ll live and not die \add of starvation\add*. \add So\add* don’t listen to Hizkiyah when he misleads you saying \add that Yahweh will rescue you all\add*.”
\v 33 Did the gods of \add any of\add* the \add other\add* countries \add rescue their people from the power of the Assyrian\add* king?
\v 34 Where were the gods of Hamat and Arpad? Where were the gods of Sefarvayim, Hena, and Ivvah? \add Were they able to save\add* Shomron from \add the king’s power\add*?
\v 35 \add From all the other countries, which of their gods was able to save their people, that might give confidence\add* that Yahweh \add might be able to\add* rescue Yerushalem from \add the king’s power\add*?”
\p
\v 36 \add But\add* the people \add on the wall listening\add* remained silent—they didn’t \add say\add* a word because the king \add had already ordered them not to answer the Assyrians\add*.
\v 37 Then Hilkiyyah’s son Elyakim \add the palace manager\add*, Shebna the scribe and Asaf’s son Yoah the secretary \add went back in the city to\add* Hizkiyah, \add tearing their clothes as they went\add*, and they \add relayed\add* the words of the chief commander to him.

\v 21 This is what Yahweh says about \add that king\add*:
\q1 Tsiyyon’s daughter despises you and derides you.
\q1 Yerushalem’s daughter shakes her head at you.
\q1
\v 22 Who \add did you think\add* you were teasing and insulting?

\q1 \add Did you raise your eyebrows\add* against Yisrael’s holy one?

\q1 You said that you went over the highest mountains with your many chariots.
\q1 That you went to the highest parts of Lebanon and harvested its tallest cedars—its best trees.
\q1 That you’ve been \add to the end of the inhabited world\add* with its densest forest.
\q1
\v 24 You said that you’ve dug wells far away and drunk their water,
\q1 yet with your own feet you dried up all of Egypt’s rivers.
\q1
\v 25 Haven’t you heard that I \add made plans\add* long ago—
\q1 that what I previously planned, I’m now \add making it happen\add*?
\q1 Fortified cities will collapse into heaps of rubble.
\q1
\v 26 Their inhabitants will be powerless—dismayed and ashamed.
\q1 They’ll be \add as vulnerable\add* as plants in the countryside,

\q1 they \add wilt and wither\add* before they can grow tall. DOUBLE-CHECK
\q1
\v 27 \add Yes,\add* I know when you sit down and when you go out.
\q1 When you come in and rage against me.
\q1
\v 28 Because you’ve raged against me and your arrogance has come to my ears,

\q1 and I’ll lead you back on the road that you came here on.
\p
\v 29 “\add So\add* this will be a sign to you \add Hizkiyah\add*:
\q1 This year you’ll eat what grew by itself,

\q1

\v 5 \add Menashsheh\add* built altars to all the \add constellations\add* in the two courts of the \add temple\add*.
\v 6 He \add even sacrificed his own son as a burnt offering\add*. He practised divination and read omens, and consulted mediums and fortune-tellers. He did \add so much that Yahweh had said was\add* evil, provoking Yahweh to get angry.
\v 7 He placed the Asherah idol that he’d made in the \add temple\add* about which Yahweh had said to David and to his son Shelomoh \add (Solomon)\add*, “I will \add establish\add* my \add reputation forever\add* in this house and in Yerushalem \add in Yehudah\add*, which I’ve chosen out of all the tribes of Yisrael.\x + \xo 21:7-8: \xt 1Ki 9:3-5; 2Ch 7:12-18.\x*
\v 8 If only the Israelis will take care to obey everything that I’ve commanded them, and all the instructions that my servant Mosheh gave them, then I won’t continue to \add cause them to leave the area\add* that I gave to their ancestors.”
\v 9 \add But\add* they didn’t listen and Menashsheh led them astray to do more evil things \add even\add* than the people groups that Yahweh had destroyed as the people had entered the region.
\p
\v 10 \add So\add* Yahweh announced via his servants the prophets,
\v 11 “Because Yehudah’s King Menashsheh has done \add such terribly evil things\add*, \add worse even than the Amorites who were there before him\add*, and \add because\add* he’s even made Yehudah sin with his idols,
\v 12 then Yisrael’s God Yahweh says: Listen, \add I’ll bring such terrible disaster to Yehudah including Yerushalem that people won’t even be able to handle hearing the news about it\add*.
\v 13 I’ll \add use the same tape measure for Yerushalem that I used for\add* Shomron \add (Samaria)\add*, and \add I’ll use the same\add* plumb line \add that I used for\add* Ahab’s \add extended family\add*. I’ll wipe Yerushalem away, just like someone \add dries\add* a bowl—they wipe \add it dry\add* and then turn it \add upside down\add*.
\v 14 I’ll abandon the \add small remainder of my people here\add*, and I’ll \add hand them over to\add* their enemies—they’ll become the spoil and plunder of all their enemies,
\v 15 because they’ve done what \add I told them was evil\add*, and they’ve been making me angry from the time that their ancestors \add were brought out of\add* Egypt \add right up\add* to this day.”
\p
\v 16 Menashsheh even poured out so much innocent blood that he filled Yerushalem \add with it\add* \add from one side to the other\add*, \add and that was on top of his other\add* sin of leading Yehudah into doing what Yahweh \add had said was\add* evil.
\p
\v 17 \add Everything else that Menashsheh said and did, including the sins that he committed, is written in the book of the events\add* of the kings of Yehudah.

\p
\v 3 In the eighth month of the eighteenth year of King Yoshiyyah’s reign, \add he\add* sent the scribe Shafan (the son of Atsalyah the son of Meshullam) to the \add temple\add*, saying
\v 4 “Go to the high priest Hilkiyyah and \add get him to\add* count the silver that was brought into Yahweh’s \add temple\add*, which the \add door-keepers\add* collected from the people.
\v 5 Then \add have it given to the supervisors of the temple repairs, and then they can pay the workers who are repairing\add* the damage—
\v 6 the craftsmen, builders, and masons, as well as buying wood and quarried stones \add for the repairs\add*.”
\v 7 They won’t need \add to submit detailed accounts\add* for it because \add they’re trustworthy people\add*.\x + \xo 22:7: \xt 2Ki 12:15.\x*
\p
\v 8 \add During the repairs,\add* the hight priest Hilkiyyah told the scribe Shafan, “I found a scroll in the temple \add with Yahweh’s instructions written on it\add*.” \add So\add* Hilkiyyah gave the scroll to Shafan \add to\add* read.
\v 9 Then Shafan the scribe went to the king \add with this report\add*, “Your servants \add handed over the money that had been collected in the temple\add*, and they gave it to the \add supervisors of the workers doing the repairs\add*.”
\v 10 Then he \add added\add*, “And the priest Hilkiyyah gave me a scroll.” Then he read it \add out loud\add* to King \add Yoshiyyah\add*.
\p
\v 11 When the king heard the contents of the scroll, he tore his clothes
\v 12 and commanded the priest Hilkiyyah, Shafan’s son Ahikam, Mikayah’s son Akbor, the scribe Shafan, and the king’s servant Asayah,
\v 13 “Go \add and\add* \add inquire from\add* Yahweh on my behalf and on behalf of the people and all Yehudah, concerning the words of this scroll that was found. Because \add it sounds like\add* Yahweh \add must be very angry at us because our predecessors\add* didn’t listen to \add what’s written on\add* this scroll \add and didn’t do what was expected of\add* us.”
\p
\v 14 \add So\add* Hilkiyyah the priest and Ahikam, Akbor, Shafan, and Asayah went to the prophetess Huldah (the wife of Shallum, the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, the \add one in charge of looking after the priests’ uniforms\add* who lived in \add the newer part of\add* Yerushalem), and they spoke to her.
\v 15 She told them that Yisrael’s God Yahweh had said, “Tell the man who sent you all to me
\v 16 that Yahweh says this: I’m going to bring disaster to this place and its inhabitants, \add just like it’s written\add* in the scroll that the king read
\v 17 because they abandoned me. They \add offered sacrifices\add* to other gods in order to make me angry \add at everything they do, so now my anger will be directed\add* against this place and it’s \add not stoppable\add*.
\v 18 But to the king of Yehudah who sent you all to seek Yahweh, tell him that Yisrael’s God Yahweh says: The words that you heard \add from the scroll\add*,
\v 19 because \add you’re open to learn\add* and \add because\add* you humbled yourself \add in front\add* of Yahweh when you heard \add my promise that\add* this place and its inhabitants would become a horror and a curse, and \add because\add* you’ve torn your clothes and wept \add in front of me\add*, then Yahweh \add said that he’s taken notice of you\add*.
\v 20 \add Because of that, he’ll allow you to die and be buried peacefully, and you yourself won’t witness the destruction that will come\add* to this place.”
\p \add So they relayed those messages\add* back to King \add Yoshiyyah\add*.

\v 1 Then King \add Yoshiyyah\add* \add summoned\add* all the elders of Yerushalem and \add across\add* Yehudah,
\v 2 and \add he\add* went to the \add temple\add*, and all the inhabitants of Yerushalem and from all across Yehudah went with him, along with the priests and prophets, and all the people from the \add most to the least important\add*.

All the people \add were also included in that commitment\add*.
\p
\v 4 Then the king commanded the high priest Hilkiyyah and the \add other\add* priests, and the \add temple\add* guards to bring out all the utensils that were made for Baal and Asherah and for all the \add constellations\add*, and he burnt them outside Yerushalem in the Kidron countryside, and carried their ashes to Beyt-El.
\v 5 He \add got rid of\add* the pagan priests that the kings of Yehudah had appointed to burn incense in the \add hilltop shrines\add* around Yerushalem and across \add the rest of\add* Yehudah, and the ones who burnt incense to Baal, and to the sun and moon and to the planets and constellations.
\v 6 He got the Asherah pole out from Yahweh’s \add temple\add* and burnt it in the Kidron valley outside Yerushalem, then he \add pounded the ashes\add* to dust and threw it over \add people’s\add* graves.
\v 7 He \add demolished\add* the \add cubicles\add* of the male temple prostitutes that were inside Yahweh’s \add temple\add* where the women were weaving Asherah \add coverings\add*.\f + \fr 23:7 \ft It’s not exactly clear what these woven objects were, or how or where they were used.\f*
\v 8 He brought all the priests \add to Yerushalem\add* from the cities of Yehudah, and he desecrated the \add hilltop shrines\add* where the priests had burnt incense, from Geba to Beer-Sheva. He \add demolished\add* the \add hilltop shrines\add* that Yehoshua (a city official) had built near the city gate (on the left of the gate as you entered the city).
\v 9 However those priests \add from those hilltop shrines\add* weren’t allowed to \add serve at\add* the altar in Yerushalem, \add but they were allowed to\add* eat unleavened bread \add like the other priests\add*.
\p
\v 10 \add Yoshiyyah\add* \add also\add* desecrated the Tofet, which was in the Ben-Hinnom valley, so that \add the people couldn’t sacrifice their children\add* to Molek.
\v 11 The horses that the kings of Yehudah \add had offered\add* to the sun, he \add prevented\add* from approaching the hall of the \add official\add* Natan-Melek that was in the courtyards of Yahweh’s \add temple\add*, and he \add set fire to\add* the chariots of the sun.
\v 12 Then the king tore down the altars that were on the roof in Ahaz’s upper chamber that the kings of Yehudah made, and the altars that Menashsheh made in the two courts of Yahweh’s \add temple\add* and he threw \add the rubble\add* into the Kidron valley.
\v 13 The king desecrated the \add hilltop shrines that faced\add* Yerushalem—they were \add south\add* of the ‘Mount of Destruction’ \add (the Mount of Olives)\add*. King Shelomoh had built \add shrines\add* for Ashtarot (the disgusting \add god\add* of the Sidonians) and for Kemosh (the disgusting \add god\add* of Moab) and for Molek (the disgusting \add god\add* of the \add Ammonites\add*).
\v 14 He \add also\add* smashed the \add sacred\add* pillars and cut down the Asherah poles, then he \add desecrated\add* those places \add by filling them\add* with human bones.
\p
\v 15 He also \add demolished\add* the altar that was in Beyt-El—the \add hilltop shrine\add* that Nebat’s son Yarave’am had made when he’d caused Yisrael to sin. He \add demolished\add* both that altar and the \add hilltop shrine\add*, then he burnt the \add shrine\add*. He crushed \add everything\add* to dust, and he burnt the Asherah pole.
\v 16 \add As\add* Yoshiyyah turned \add around\add*, he \add noticed some\add* graves that were there on the hillside, \add so\add* he \add had some bones removed\add* from the graves, and he burnt them on the altar \add to\add* desecrate it. \add This fulfilled what Yahweh had said through\add* the man of God who’d proclaimed these things.\x + \xo 23:16 \xt 1Ki 13:2-3.\x*
\v 17 \add Yoshiyyah\add* \add turned again and\add* \add asked\add*, “\add Whose tomb is that\add*?”
\p “It’s the prophet’s tomb,” the people of Beyt-El replied, “\add The one\add* who came from Yehudah and predicted that \add what you just did to that\add* altar would happen.”
\v 18 “\add Don’t disturb it then\add*,” \add the king\add* \add ordered\add*. “Don’t let anyone \add remove\add* his bones.”
\p \add So\add* they \add left\add* his bones \add alone\add*, \add along with\add* the bones of the \add other\add* prophet who came from Shomron.
