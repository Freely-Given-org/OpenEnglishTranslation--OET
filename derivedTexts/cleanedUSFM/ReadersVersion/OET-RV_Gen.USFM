\is1 Introduction
\ip The meaning of the English name \bk Genesis\bk* is ‘source’ or ‘beginning’. Hebrew readers call this document ‘Bereshit’ which is the first word in the Hebrew and means ‘In the beginning’. Some European and other translations call it ‘The first book of Mosheh/Moses’.
\ip This document describes the creation of space and of our planet and its contents, the origin of people, and the beginning of sin and suffering here in the world. This account also describes how God chose one particular people group and how he brought them to the land that he had promised them.
\ip This document has two main parts:
\ip 1. The making of world and the account of the first two people, and then the first ten generations of their descendants. We read about the foundations of human culture, beginning with Adam and Eve and their banishment from the garden, about Kayin killing his brother Abil, about Noah and the worldwide flood, and about the construction of the tower at Babel.
\ip 2. The lives of the ancestors of the Jewish people: Abraham the first ancestor became famous due to his faith and trust, and his obedience of God’s commands. Following that is the account about his son Yitshak (Isaac), and his grandson Yacob (Jacob, also named ‘Yisra’el’ or ‘Israel’), and then Yacob’s twelve sons who became the founders of the twelve tribes of Yisra’el. That account also includes the part about Yacob’s son Yosef and what happened him when he was sold into Egypt (Heb. Mitsrayim) by his brothers as a slave.
\ip We also read the accounts here about the various people gropus that proliferated across the continent and formed into nations.
\ip There in final parts of this account, we’re told about God’s eternal promise of God to the people group that he chose. God doesn’t forget his promises, but he also judges and punishes those who disobey him.

\s1 The six days of creation
\rem /s1 Six Days of Creation and the Sabbath; The Account of Creation; The Beginning; The Story of Creation; The creation of the universe
\p
\v 1 In the beginning, God\f + \fr 1:1 \ft As per common practice, we use ‘God’ through the Hebrew scriptures for the word ‘elohim’. Note that ‘elohim’ is a Hebrew language plural, and is translated more literally as ‘gods’ in a few places. However the connected Hebrew verb translated ‘created’ here is clearly a singular form, so the singular noun ‘God’ fits better here and everywhere where ‘elohim’ is used with other verbs marked as being singular. The mysterious plurality of God is confirmed in v26 where ‘our’ is used to refer to him/them.\f* created the heavens and the earth.
\v 2 The earth was formless and empty and darkness covered the surface of the depth \add waters\add* and God’s spirit was hovering over the surface of the waters.
\v 3 Then God said, “Let there be light,” and light came into existence,\x + \xo 1:3: \xt 2Cor 4:6.\x*
\v 4 and God observed that the light was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness.
\v 5 God named the light \em daytime\em*, and the darkness he named \em nighttime\em*. Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of the\add* first day.
\p
\v 6 Then God said, “Let there be a large space in the middle of the waters, and let it separate the two lots of waters.”\x + \xo 1:6-8: \xt 2Pe 3:5.\x*
\v 7 So God made the large space and separated between the waters that were underneath from the waters that were above it. Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 8 and he named the space \em sky\em*. Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the second day.
\p
\v 9 Then God said, “Let the waters under the sky be gathered to one place, and let the dry ground appear.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 10 and he named the ground that appeared \em land\em*, and he named the gathered waters \add seas\add*, and he saw that \add what he had done\add* was good.
\v 11 Then God said, “Let the land sprout vegetation: every plant yielding seed, every fruit tree bearing its own fruit that has its seed inside it, on the earth.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 12 so the land started producing vegetation, every plant producing its own seed, and every tree bearing fruit that has its seed inside it. And God saw that \add what he had done\add* was good.
\v 13 Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the third day.
\p
\v 14 Then God said, “Let there be lights in the sky to separate daytime from nighttime, so they’ll be signs, and for \add indicating\add* seasons, and for \add tracking\add* days and years.
\v 15 They must function as lights in the sky that shine \add light\add* on the earth.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 16 so God made the two large lights, the larger, brighter light to rule the day, and the smaller light to rule the night, and he \add also\add* made the stars.
\v 17 He put those lights in the sky to shine \add light\add* on the earth,
\v 18 and to oversee the daytime and the nighttime, and to distinguish between the light and the darkness. And God saw that \add what he had done\add* was good.
\v 19 Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the fourth day.
\p
\v 20 Then God said, “Let the waters be full of with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly in the sky above the earth.”
\v 21 So God created the great sea creatures and every kind of living creature that moves which the waters swarm with, and every kind of winged bird. And God saw that \add what he had done\add* was good,
\v 22 and he blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth.”
\v 23 Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the fifth day.
\p
\v 24 Then God said, “Let the land bring forth every kind of living creature: livestock and every crawling creature and every kind of living thing on the earth.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 25 so he made every kind of creature of the earth, and every kind of livestock, and every kind of crawling creature on the ground. And God saw that \add what he had done\add* was good.
\p
\v 26 Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them rule over the fish in the sea and over the birds in the sky and over the livestock and over all the earth, and over every creature moving on the earth.”\x + \xo 1:26: \xt 1Cor 11:7.\x*
\v 27 Then God created humankind in his image, \add yes,\add* created in the image of God—male and female he created them.\x + \xo 1:27-28: \xt Gen 5:1-2.\x*
\v 28 Then God blessed them and told them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and take control of it. You’re in charge of the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
\v 29 Then God said, “Look, I’ve given you every plant throughout the whole earth that yields seed, and every tree that has fruit with a seed or seeds inside it. They will be yours for food,
\v 30 and to every living thing on the earth, and to every bird in the sky, and to everything moving on the earth that has living breath in it, I’ve given every green plant for food.” Everything happened \add exactly\add* as he commanded,
\v 31 and he saw everything that he’d made, and wow, it was \em very\em* good. Then evening came, and \add later\add* morning came, \add and that was the end of\add* the sixth day.
\c 2
\p
\v 1 So the heavens and the earth were completed, along with everything in them.
\v 2 By the seventh day God had finished his work, so he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he’d done.\x + \xo 2:2-3: \xt Exo 20:11.\x*
\v 3 Then God blessed the seventh day and declared it to be different from the other days, because on that \add first Saturday\add*, he rested from all his work of creating.

\v 4 What follows tells\f + \fr 2:4 \ft This little formula is sometimes known as a ‘toledoth’ (or ‘tōlədōt’, from the Hebrew word) and seems to mark a new section, but it’s debated whether this part belongs at the bottom of the previous section, or at the top of the following section. We’re assuming the later here.\f* \add more details about\add* the history of what God did when he created the heavens and the earth:
\rem /s1 The Garden of Eden; The Man and Woman in Eden; Another Account of the Creation
\p During the time when Yahweh God\f + \fr 2:4 \ft This is the first occurrence of the Hebrew letters ‘יהוה’ (YHWH) in the Bible, which we find out later (in Exodus 3, also compiled by Moses) is God’s actual name. Although the vowels which go with those four consonants have been lost over the millenia, most scholars believe ‘Yahweh’ to be the best guess that we can make. (It’s certainly NOT ‘Jehovah’, which was a historical mistake made by confusing the vowels of two different words.) Some older translations use \sc LORD\sc* which is NOT a translation of ‘יהוה’ (which means ‘I am’), but which represents confusion over the more recent Jewish (but non-Biblical) custom of not pronouncing God’s name (and which makes one wonder what’s the use of telling people your name if they’re then not allowed to use it).\f* made the earth and the heavens,
\v 5 there weren’t yet any bushes growing on the earth, and no plants had yet sprung up in the fields, because Yahweh God had not yet made it rain, and nor were there any people yet to till the ground.
\v 6 However, a mist came up from the ground and watered the entire surface of the land.
\p
\v 7 Then Yahweh God formed the \add first\add* man out of the dust on the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living person.\x + \xo 2:7: \xt 1Cor 15:45.\x*
\p
\v 8 Now in the east, Yahweh God had planted a garden in Eden, and he put the man there that he had formed.
\v 9 He \add also\add* caused all kinds of trees to grow there—\add some\add* that are pleasant to look at and good for food. In the middle of the garden was the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil\x + \xo 2:9: \xt Rev 2:7; 22:2,14.\x*
\p
\v 10 A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and then from there it split into four rivers.
\v 11 The first river was named Pishon, and it winds around through the entire region of Havilah, where there’s gold.
\v 12 The gold from there is \add very pure\add*, and there’s also \add a type of fragrant resin\add* and onyx \add gemstones\add* there.
\v 13 The second river was named Gihon, and it winds through the entire region of Cush.
\v 14 The third river was named Tigris, and it flowed east of the Asshur \add region\add*, and then the fourth river was \add named\add* Frat.
\p
\v 15 Yahweh God took the man and put him in the garden at Eden to cultivate and maintain it
\v 16 and instructed him, “You can eat as much \add fruit\add* as you want from any tree in the garden,
\v 17 but you mustn’t eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because the day you eat its \add fruit\add* you’ll certainly die.”
\p
\v 18 Then Yahweh God said, “It’s not good for the man to be alone, so I’ll make a suitable helper for him.”
\p
\v 19 Now Yahweh God had formed every living thing of the field and every bird of the sky from the ground, so he brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and whatever the man called each living creature, that would become its name.
\v 20 The man gave names to all the \add various\add* livestock and to the birds of the sky and to every living creature in the fields, but none of them was a suitable \add companion\add* to help him.
\p
\v 21 So Yahweh God caused the man to go into a deep sleep, and then while he was sleeping, he removed one of his ribs and closed up \add over\add* its place with flesh.
\v 22 Then Yahweh God used the rib which he had taken from the man to form into a woman, and he brought her to the man,
\v 23 and the man said:
\q1 “Now this is bone from my bones
\q2 and flesh from my flesh.
\q1 She’ll be named ‘woman’
\q2 because she came from a man.”
\m
\v 24 So that’s why a man leaves his father and mother, and becomes united to his wife, and the two of them become one being.\x + \xo 2:24: \xt Mat 19:5; Mrk 10:7-8; 1Cor 6:16; Eph 5:31.\x*
\p
\v 25 At that time, both the man and his wife were naked, but they had no sense of shame.

\s1 The couple disobey God
\rem /s1 The Fall of Man; Human Disobedience; The Man and Woman Sin; The First Sin and Its Punishment
\p
\v 1 Now the snake was the craftiest of all the animals that Yahweh God had created, and \add one day\add* he asked the woman, “Did God really command you to not eat \add fruit\add* from any of the trees in the garden?”\x + \xo 3:1: \xt Rev 12:9; 20:2.\x*
\p
\v 2 “No,” answered the woman, “we can eat the fruit from \add any\add* of the trees in the garden,
\v 3 except from the tree that is in the centre. He commanded \add us\add* to not eat that fruit or even touch it, because if we do, we will die!”
\p
\v 4 But the serpent said to the woman, “It’s not definite that you’ll die.
\v 5 Actually, God knows that as soon as you eat fruit from that tree, you’ll understand new things, so that you will know \add what’s\add* right and \add what’s\add* wrong just like God does.”
\p
\v 6 The woman saw that the tree’s \add fruit looked\add* good to eat and that the tree itself was very atractive, plus she wanted \add to eat\add* the fruit so that it would make her wise. So she picked some of the fruit and ate it and she also gave \add some of it\add* to her husband \add who was there\add* with her, and he ate it \add too\add*.
\v 7 \add Immediately\add* they both had new understanding and they felt their nakedness. So they sewed \add some\add* fig leaves together and made skirts for themselves.
\p
\v 8 \add Late that afternoon,\add* during the cool time of the day, the man and his wife heard Yahweh God’s voice as he walked in the garden, but they hid from him behind some trees in the garden,
\v 9 so Yahweh God called out to the man, “\add Adam,\add* where are you?”
\p
\v 10 “I heard you \add walking\add* in the garden,” he replied, “but I was scared because I was naked, so I hid \add myself\add*.”
\p
\v 11 “Who told you that you’re naked?” Yahweh God asked. “Have you eaten \add the fruit\add* that I told you not to eat?”
\p
\v 12 “The woman that you put here beside me,” answered the man, “she gave me \add some\add* fruit from the tree and I ate it.”
\p
\v 13 Then Yahweh God asked the woman, “What did you do?”\x + \xo 3:13: \xt 2Cor 11:3; 1Tim 2:14.\x*
\p “The snake tricked me, so I ate \add some of the fruit\add*,” the woman replied.
\s1 God’s judgements after they disobeyed
\rem /s1 God Pronounces Judgment
\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh God said to the snake,
\q1 “Because you’ve done this you’ll be cursed more than all the livestock,
\q2 and more than every living thing in the fields.
\q1 \add Now\add* you’ll move along on your belly,
\q2 and you’ll eat dust all the rest of your life.
\q1
\v 15 I’ll put hostility between you and the woman
\q2 between your descendants and hers.
\q1 He will crush your head
\q2 and you’ll strike his heel.”\x + \xo 3:15: \xt Rev 12:17.\x*
\p
\v 16 To the woman God said,
\q1 “I’ll sharply increase your pain in childbirth.
\q2 You’ll produce children in pain.
\q1 Your desire will be for your husband
\q2 and he will rule over you.”
\p
\v 17 Then \add God\add* said to the man,\x + \xo 3:17-18: \xt Heb 6:8.\x*
\q1 “Because you did what your wife told you
\q2 and ate from that tree
\q2 that I’d told you not to eat from,
\q1 then the ground will be cursed because of you.
\q1 You’ll have to work hard to get food from it
\q2 all the rest of your life.
\q1
\v 18 It’ll produce thorns and thistles for you
\q2 although you’ll eat the crops of the fields.
\q1
\v 19 You’ll eat bread with sweat drops on your nose
\q2 until you return to the ground
\q2 because you were taken out of the ground.
\q1 \add Yes,\add* you were \add created\add* from dust,
\q2 and you’ll return back to dust.”
\p
\v 20 Then the man named his wife ‘Havvah’ \add (which means ‘living’)\add* because she would become the mother of all future people.
\v 21 Then Yahweh God made clothes from \add animal\add* skins for Adam and his wife and he dressed them.
\s1 The humans get expelled from the garden

\p
\v 22 Then Yahweh God said, “See, the man has become like one of us, being aware of good and evil. But now, he mustn’t \add be allowed\add* to reach out his hand and also take \add fruit\add* from the tree of life and eat it and live forever.”\x + \xo 3:22: \xt Rev 22:14.\x*
\v 23 So Yahweh God expelled \add them\add* out of the garden in Eden to work the soil from which \add Adam\add* had been taken.
\p
\v 24 After he expelled them, he placed sentries on the east side of the garden in Eden, as well as a fiery sword that swung around in every direction to guard the path to the tree of life.

\p
\v 1 Then Adam slept with his wife, and she conceived and \add in due course \add* gave birth to Kayin (Cain). “Yahweh has enabled me to produce a man,” she said.
\v 2 \add Eventually\add* she also gave birth to Kayin’s brother, Abel. Abel became a shepherd, while Kayin became a crop farmer.
\v 3 Some \add months\add* later, Kayin brought some of what he’d grown in the ground as an offering to Yahweh,
\v 4 and also Abel brought the best portions from some of the firstborn of his flock. Now Yahweh was pleased with Abel and his offering,\x + \xo 4:4: \xt Heb 11:4.\x*
\v 5 but he didn’t even look towards Kayin and his offering. Kayin got very angry and his face showed his displeasure.
\v 6 Then Yahweh said to Kayin, “Why are you so angry? And why are you frowning like that?
\v 7 If you do what’s right, won’t you be honoured? But if you don’t do what’s right, sin is crouching in the doorway wanting to have you, but you have the control over it.”
\p
\v 8 \add One day,\add* Kayin spoke to his brother Abel when they were \add out\add* in the field, and then Kayin attacked him and killed him.\x + \xo 4:8: \xt Mat 23:35; Luk 11:51; 1Jn 3:12.\x*
\p
\v 9 \add Later\add* Yahweh asked Kayin, “Where’s your brother Abel?”
\p “I don’t know,” he replied, “It’s not my job to look after my brother.”
\p
\v 10 “What have you done?” Yahweh asked. “Your brother’s blood is calling out to me from the ground.\x + \xo 4:10: \xt Heb 12:24.\x*
\v 11 So now you’re cursed and banished from the soil that your brother’s blood soaked into as a result of your actions.
\v 12 Whenever you till \add and plant\add* the ground, it will no longer produce good yields for you. You’ll be a fugitive and wandering \add refugee\add* on the earth.”
\p
\v 13 “My punishment is more than I can bear,” Kayin \add complained\add* to Yahweh.
\v 14 “Look, you’re now driving me \add away\add* from the ground \add I’ve been cultivating\add* to somewhere where you won’t be able to see me. I’ll be a wandering \add refugee\add* on the earth, and anyone who finds me will kill me.”
\p
\v 15 “Very well,”, replied Yahweh and declared, “If anyone kills Kayin, then that person will receive a seven times greater \add sentence\add*.” Then Yahweh marked Kayin so that no one who found him would kill him,
\v 16 and Kayin left Yahweh’s presence and settled in the land of Nod to the east of Eden.

\p
\v 17 Then Kayin slept with his wife and and she conceived and gave birth to Hanoch (Enoch). Then Kayin founded a town and named it Hanoch after his son.
\v 18 \add Eventually\add* Hanoch fathered Irad, and Irad fathered Mehuyael, and Mehuyael father Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lemech (Lamech).
\v 19 Lemech had two wives: the first was named Adah and the second was Tsillah (Zillah).
\v 20 Adah gave birth to Yaval (Jabal) who became the ancestor of people who live in tents and rear cattle.
\v 21 His brother’s name was Yuval (Jubal) and he became the ancestor of people who play stringed and wind instruments.
\v 22 Tsillah gave birth to Tuval-Kayin (Tubal-Cain) who forged all \add kinds of\add* tools out of bronze and iron. His sister was \add named\add* Naamah.
\v 23 Then Lemech said to his wives:
\q1 “Adah and Tsillah, listen to me.
\q2 My wives, take notice of my words;
\q1 I killed a man who had wounded me;
\q2 I killed a young man who hurt me.

\v 25 Then Adam slept with his wife again and she bore a son and named him Shet (Seth) \add (which means ‘given’)\add* because she had said, “God has given me another son in place of Abel who was killed by Kayin.”

\p
\v 1 When people began to multiply on the earth’s surface, and they were having daughters,\x + \xo 6:1-4: \xt Yob 1:6; 2:1.\x*
\v 2 God’s sons saw that men’s daughters were beautiful, and they took any that they wanted for themselves as wives.
\v 3 Then Yahweh said, “My Spirit won’t tolerate people forever, because they are physical beings, therefore their \add remaining\add* time will be 120 years.”
\v 4 The NEFILIM were on the earth in those days and also after that, when the sons of God went to the daughters of humankind and they bore children for them. INVESTIGATE They were the mighty \add warriors\add* of long ago—those famous men.\x + \xo 6:4: \xt Num 13:33.\x*
\p
\v 5 Then Yahweh saw that the humankind’s wickedness on the earth was extensive, and that every inclination of their inner thoughts was only evil all day long.\x + \xo 6:5-8: \xt Mat 24:37; Luk 17:26; 1Pe 3:20.\x*
\v 6 So Yahweh regretted that he had made humankind on the earth and he was deeply saddened,
\v 7 so he said, “This humankind that I created, I will completely destroy them from the surface of the ground, along with the animals, and crawling creatures and the birds of the sky, because I regret that I made them.”
\v 8 However, Yahweh noticed Noah and was pleased with him.

\rem /s1 Noah; Noah Pleases God
\p
\v 9 This is the account of Noah: He was a man who obeyed God, blameless among the people of his time and he walked around with God.\x + \xo 6:9: \xt 2Pe 2:5.\x*
\v 10 Noah had three sons: Yafet (Japheth), Shem, and Ham.
\p
\v 11 Now God noticed that \add humankind\add* was corrupt and very violent.
\v 12 \add Yes,\add* God looked at the earth, and wow, all the living creatures on the earth had corrupted their behaviour.
\p
\v 13 So God told Noah, “I’ve decided to put an end to all people on earth because the earth is filled with violence because of them. So listen, I myself am going to destroy all of them, along with the earth.
\v 14 Make yourself a wooden chest\f + \fr 6:14 \ft The reader might have expected the word ‘ark’ here, but sadly the Latin word ‘arca’ meaning ‘large box, chest’ led to the English word ‘ark’ being invented, and why we can’t use it here, is that now for most English readers, they picture a large boat in their minds when they hear that word. If you think about the ‘ark of the covenant’ that uses the same word, hopefully you can understand how anything like a ‘boat’ is the wrong word picture, hence we’ve gone back to translating the actual Hebrew word here.\f* out of cypress. Build rooms inside it, and seal it both inside and outside with resin.
\v 15 These are the dimensions for it: 140m long, 23m wide, and 14m high.
\v 16 It must have a roof, but the last half a metre between the sides and the roof should remain open. Put the door in its side, and build lower, middle, and upper decks.
\v 17 You see, I’m going to flood the earth with water to destroy every creature that breathes. Everything that’s on the earth will die.
\v 18 \add But\add* I’ll make an agreement with you, so you must go into this chest along with your wife and sons and their wives,
\v 19 and you must take a pair, male and female, of everything that lives into the chest to keep alive with you.
\v 20 Pairs of every kind of bird and animal, including every kind of creature that moves on the ground, will come to you so that you keep them alive,
\v 21 and you must take with you some of every different kind of food and store it in there for you and them to eat.
\v 22 So Noah did \add that\add* exactly as God had specified.\x + \xo 6:22: \xt Heb 11:7.\x*

\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and all your household, because I’ve seen that you’re the \add only\add* one who obeys me in this generation.
\v 2 Take in seven male and female pairs of every kind of ‘clean’ animal, and one male and female pair of the ‘unclean’ animals,
\v 3 as well as seven male and female pairs of every kind of flying bird \add in order\add* to preserve their kinds on the earth.
\v 4 Seven days from now I’ll send forty days and nights of rain on the earth, and I’ll eliminate every living thing that I’ve made that’s \add still\add* on the ground.
\v 5 So Noah did everything that Yahweh had instructed him to do.
\p
\v 6 Noah was 600 years old when the flood covered the earth,
\v 7 and he went into the \add wooden\add* chest along with his wife, his \add three\add* sons and their wives, \add in order\add* to escape from the floodwaters.\x + \xo 7:7: \xt Mat 24:38-39; Luk 17:27.\x*
\v 8 ‘Clean’ and ‘unclean’ animals, the birds, and everything that lived on the ground
\v 9 came to Noah in male and female pairs and went into the chest, just like God had instructed Noah.
\v 10 Then when the seven days were up, water \add started\add* to flood the earth.
\p
\v 11 When Noah was 600 years old (and around the beginning of May), deep underwater geysers in the ocean started spouting out water, and the skies began to drop heavy rain\x + \xo 7:11: \xt 2Pe 3:6.\x*
\v 12 that continued day and night for forty days.
\v 13 That was the very day that Noah and Yafet and Shem and Ham and their wives had all entered the \add wooden\add* chest.
\v 14 They had with them every kind of living creature, including every kind of livestock and every \add other\add* kind of creature that lives on the land, and every kind of bird \add and\add* everything \add else\add* that flies.
\v 15 They had come to Noah \add in order\add* to enter the chest—two by two of every creature with the breath of life.
\v 16 So \add pairs of\add* males and females of every creature entered just as God had instructed \add Noah\add*, then Yahweh \add closed the door and\add* they were shut in.
\p
\v 17 Then the flood came onto the earth for forty days, and the water rose so that the \add wooden\add* chest was lifted up right off the land.
\v 18 The water continued to rise and get deeper on the earth, and the chest floated along on top of the water.
\v 19 \add Eventually\add* the water on the earth got so deep that all the high mountains everywhere under the sky were under water—
\v 20 \add in fact\add* the water rose over seven metres above the tops of them.
\v 21 \add By\add* then every living creature that lived on the earth had drowned—birds, livestock, animals, every creature that swarms upon the earth, and all humankind.
\v 22 Everything that \add had\add* the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils, everything that \add lived\add* on dry land, died.
\v 23 That’s how \add Yahweh\add* completely annihilated every living creature off the earth, including humankind and livestock and crawling creatures and \add even\add* the birds. Everything was annihilated except for Noah and those with him in the \add floating\add* chest,
\v 24 and the earth remained in full flood for 150 days.

\rem /s1 The End of the Flood; The Flood Recedes; The Flood Subsides
\p
\v 1 Then God considered Noah and and all the living things and all the livestock that were with him in the \add floating\add* chest, and he caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters \add started to\add* subside
\v 2 and the underwater geysers and the rain was stopped.
\v 3 Then the water steadily receded from the earth and after five months the water had gone down \add enough\add*
\v 4 that by October the \add wooden\add* chest was left sitting on one of the Ararat mountains.
\v 5 The water continued to recede until December when the tops of the mountains became visible.
\p
\v 6 Then after another forty days, Noah opened a window near the \add top\add* of the chest
\v 7 and he released a raven which kept flying out and returning until the land started to dry out.
\v 8 Then Noah \add also\add* released a dove to see if the land was really out of the water,
\v 9 but the dove didn’t find anywhere to land so it returned to the window because the surface of the earth was still wet, and he stretched out his arm and brought the dove back inside.
\v 10 Noah waited another week and then he released the dove again
\v 11 and it returned to him in the evening and wow, it had a fresh, green olive leaf in its beak. So now Noah knew that the land was out of the water.
\v 12 Then he waited another week, and released the dove \add again\add*, but this time it didn’t come back to him.
\p
\v 13 So it was when Noah was 601 years old (in the month of WHAT MONTH on the first day of the \add Jewish\add* new year) the land was still drying out. So Noah made an opening in the top of the \add wooden\add* chest and saw that the land surface \add there\add* was \add almost\add* dry.
\v 14 By the end of the next month, the land was fully dry.
\p
\v 15 Then God said to Noah,
\v 16 “Leave the \add wooden\add* chest along with your sons and each of your wives.
\v 17 Take out all the living creatures that are with you, including the birds and livestock, and everything that crawls (CHECK FOR WORD CONSISTENCY) on the ground, so that they’ll proliferate and increase their numbers \add all\add* over the earth.
\v 18 So Noah went outside, along with his sons and each of their wives.
\v 19 Every living creature, every crawling thing and every bird, everything moving on the earth, went outside kind by kind.

\v 5 Also, I will certainly require blood as payment for people’s lives: if anyone murders another person, I require that the murderer must die, and even if an animal kills a human being, I require that it must die.
\v 6 \add Yes,\add* if anyone sheds human blood, the others must shed the murderer’s blood, because God made human beings in his image.\x + \xo 9:6: \xt Exo 20:13; Gen 1:26.\x*

\v 12 Then God added, “This is how I’ll show everyone that I’ve made this agreement with you and with all the living creatures that are with you, along with all future generations:

\v 23 So Shem and Yafet took a robe, and holding it between their shoulders they walked backwards into the tent and covered their father’s nakedness. (Their faces were towards the tent entrance, so they didn’t see his nakedness.)
\v 24 \add Eventually,\add* Noah woke up from his drunken sleep and found out what his youngest son (Ham) had done to him

\v 9 Isn’t the whole land available to you? So let’s separate. If you go to the left then I’ll go right, or if you go to the right then I’ll go left.”

\v 1 At the time when Amraphel was king of Shinar, Arioch was king of Ellasar, Kedorlaomer was king of Elam, and Tidal was king of the Goyim,
\v 2 they went to war against Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also known as Tso’ar).
\v 3 Those latter five kings joined forces in the Siddim valley (also known as the Salt Sea valley).
\v 4 They had been subject to King Kedorlaomer for twelve years, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled.
\p
\v 5 Then in the fourteenth year, Kedorlaomer and the kings who were with him went and attacked the Rephaim in Ashteroth-Karnaim, and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-Kiriathaim,

\v 1 After those events, Yahweh spoke to Abram in a vision, telling him, “Don’t be afraid, Abram, because I’ll protect you and I’ll generously and richly reward you.”
\p
\v 2 “My master Yahweh,” replied Abram, “what will you give me, since we have no children and it’s Eliezer (\add my chief slave\add* from Damascus) who’ll inherit all my possesions?”
\v 3 Then he continued, \add Yes,\add* you haven’t given me a child so wow, my heir is a slave from my household!”

\p
\v 8 “My master Yahweh,” Abram asked, “how will I know that I will possess it?”
\p
\v 9 “Bring me a three-year-old heifer,” Yahweh replied, “and a three-year-old she-goat and a three-year-old ram and a turtledove and a young pigeon.”
\v 10 So \add Abram\add* brought all those to \add Yahweh\add*, and then he cut the animals (but not the birds) in half down the middle and laid the halves opposite to each other.

\p
\v 1 Now Abram’s wife Sarai hadn’t been able to give him any children, but she had an Egyptian slave named Hagar,
\v 2 so Sarai said to Abram, “Listen, Yahweh has prevented me from having children so please sleep with my slave. Perhaps I can have a family through her.” Abram agreed to what Sarai had suggested.
\v 3 So Sarai, the wife of Abram, took Hagar, her Egyptian slave, after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife for him.
\v 4 So he slept with Hagar and she got pregnant, but once she realised that she began to despise her mistress.
\p
\v 5 So Sarai \add complained\add* to Abram, “This is all your fault. I let you sleep with my slave, but now that she’s pregnant she looks down on me. May Yahweh judge between me and you.”
\p
\v 6 “Listen,” Abram replied, “She’s \em your\em* slave to do what she’s told. Do whatever you think best.” So Sarai started mistreating Hagar, and so she ran away.
\p
\v 7 Then Yahweh’s messenger found her in the wilderness at a spring—the spring beside the road to Shur,
\v 8 and \add asked\add* her, “Hagar, Sarai’s slave, where have you come from and where are you going?”
\p “I am running away from Sarai, my mistress,” she \add replied\add*.

\v 10 then added, “I’ll give you so many descendants that they won’t even be able to be counted because there’ll be so many.”
\v 11 Then the messenger told her,
\q1 “Listen here: you’re pregnant and will give birth to a son,
\q1 and you’ll name him ‘Ishma’el’ (\add which means ‘God hears’)\add*
\q2 because Yahweh has heard your cries of misery.

\v 12 He’ll be a wild donkey of a man

\p
\v 17 Abraham fell to his knees and he laughed and said to himself, “How can a hundred year old man father a child? And what about Sarah who’s ninety-nine years old having a baby!”
\v 18 Then Abraham said to God, “If only \add you’d bless\add* Ishma’el \add as my heir\add*.”
\p
\v 19 “No,” God \add replied\add*, “It’ll be your wife Sarah who gives you a son, and you’ll name him ‘Yitshak’ \add (or ‘Isaac’, meaning ‘one who laughs’)\add*. I’ll establish my agreement with him as a never-ending commitment to him and his descendants.

\v 25 Surely you wouldn’t do anything like that—killing the good people along with the evil ones, so that they all just get treated the same? Certainly you wouldn’t do that? Wouldn’t the one who judges the entire world be more fair?”

\v 12 Then the men said to Lot, “Who else belongs to you here, a son-in-law or your sons or your daughters or anyone else who belongs to you in the city? Take them out from this place,
\v 13 because we’re \add about to\add* destroy it. \add The people have repeatedly cried out to\add* Yahweh, so he’s sent us to destroy the city.”
\p
\v 14 Then Lot went out and spoke to his \add future\add* sons-in-law who were \add engaged\add* to his daughters, and he told them, “\add Hurry\add*, get out of this place, because Yahweh is going to destroy the city!” But they thought he was just joking.
\p
\v 15 At dawn the next day, the \add two\add* messengers urged Lot, saying, “Get up, take your wife and your two daughters who’re here, so that all of you won’t be swept away in the punishment of the city.”
\v 16 When Lot hesitated, because of Yahweh’s mercy for him, the men grabbed his hand and his wife’s hand and the hands of their daughters, and led them out beyond the edge of the city.\x + \xo 19:16: \xt 2Pe 2:7.\x*
\v 17 At that point \add one of them\add* told Lot, “Flee for your lives! Don’t \add turn around and\add* look behind you and don’t stop anywhere \add down\add* in the plain. Escape \add up to\add* the hills so you don’t get swept away!”
\p
\v 18 \add But\add* Lot \add argued\add*, “Not right now, my masters.
\v 19 Listen, you’ve been kind to me and show us mercy by saving my life, but I won’t be able to make it to the hills because the disaster will overtake me and I’ll die.
\v 20 Listen, there’s a small town nearby that I could flee to. Let me escape there. It’s only small. Then my life would be saved.”
\p
\v 21 “Ok then,” the man replied, “I’ll also grant your request about this so I won’t overthrow the town that you’re talking about.
\v 22 Hurry up, escape there, because I am not able to do a thing until you go there.”
\p That’s why they \add renamed\add* the town to ‘Zoar’ \add (which means ‘small’)\add*.

\rem /s1 The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah
\p
\v 23 The sun had already risen by the time Lot \add and family\add* reached Zoar.
\v 24 Then Yahweh rained burning sulfur down onto Sodom and Gomorrah,\x + \xo 19:24-25: \xt Mat 10:15; 11:23-24; Luk 10:12; 17:29; 2Pe 2:6; Yud 7.\x*
\v 25 and he destroyed those cities and all their inhabitants as well, as all of the plain including all the vegetation.
\v 26 \add But\add* Lot’s wife who was following him looked back and she turned into a pillar of salt.\x + \xo 19:26: \xt Luk 17:32.\x*
\p
\v 27 \add Meanwhile,\add* Abraham got up early in the morning and went to the place where he had stood before Yahweh,
\v 28 and he looked down towards Sodom and Gomorrah and the land of the plain. From there he saw, wow, that smoke was rising from the land like a furnace \add chimney\add*.
\v 29 So it was that when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham and had Lot removed out of the middle of the destruction when he destroyed the cities that Lot had been living in.

\p
\v 30 Then Lot and his two daughters left Zoar and settled up in the hills, because he was afraid to stay in Zoar. So he lived in a cave \add up there\add* with his two daughters.
\v 31 Then the older girl said to the younger, “Dad’s old and there isn’t a \add single\add* man \add up here\add* to \add marry\add* us like happens to \add other women\add* in the world.
\v 32 So let’s get Dad drunk and then we can lie with him, so that at least we can have some descendants through our father.”
\v 33 So then, they got their father to drink wine that evening, and the oldest daughter went and lay with her father, but he wasn’t aware of her coming or going.
\p
\v 34 Then the next day, the older girl said to the younger, Listen, last night I lay with my father. Let’s get him drunk again tonight then you go lie with him so that we’ll give life to descendants through our father.”
\v 35 So that next evening also, they got their father to drink wine and the younger girl went and lay with him, but \add again\add* he wasn’t aware of her coming or going.
\v 36 In that way, both of Lot’s daughters got themselves pregnant through their father.
\v 37 Then the eldest daughter gave birth to a son and she named him Moab \add (which means ‘from my father’)\add*. (He’s the ancestor of the Moabites to this day.)
\v 38 The younger daughter also gave birth to a son and she named him Ben-Ammi \add (which means ‘son of my people’)\add*. (He’s the ancestor of Ammonites to this day.)

\rem /s1 Abraham Deceives Abimelech; Abraham and Abimelech; Abraham and Sarah at Gerar
\p
\v 1 Then Abraham travelled from there to the Negev region and he settled between Kadesh and Shur, staying in Gerar for a while.
\v 2 Abraham had told \add people\add* his wife Sarah was his sister, so Abimelech the king of Gerar sent for Sarah and took her.\x + \xo 20:2: \xt Gen 12:13; 26:7.\x*
\v 3 \add But\add* God came to Abimelech in a dream in the night and told him, “Listen, you’re \add as good as\add* dead because of that woman you took because she is married to a husband.”
\p
\v 4 Now Abimelech hadn’t gone near to her, so he said, “My master, would you destroy a nation even though it’s innocent?
\v 5 Didn’t Abraham himself tell me that she was his sister? And she herself also said that he was her brother. I did this with a \add clear conscience\add* and with \add clean\add* hands.”
\p
\v 6 Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know that you did this with a \add clear conscience\add* and indeed I kept you from sinning against me. I didn’t allow you to touch her for that reason.
\v 7 So now, return that man’s wife because he’s a prophet, and he’ll pray for you and you’ll live. But if you don’t return her, be certain that you and all your people will surely die.”
\p
\v 8 So \add King\add* Abimelech got up early in the morning and called for all of his slaves \add to come\add*, and he explained the entire situation to them and they were very scared.
\v 9 Then he sent for Abraham and asked him, “What have you done to us? What did I do to you that you would cause all this trouble for me and my people? What you did to me should never have happened.”
\v 10 Then he asked again, “What were you thinking when you did that?”
\p
\v 11 “Because I thought that there’s probably no one around here who \add obeys\add* God,” replied Abraham “so they might kill me because of my wife.
\v 12 \add Besides that,\add* Sarah actually \em is\em* my \add half-\add*sister. We have the same father, but different mothers, and then it was her that I took as a wife.
\v 13 \add Later\add* when God got me to leave my father’s home, I said to her, ‘You could do this one kindness do for me: Everywhere we go, just tell them that he’s your brother.’ ”
\p
\v 14 Then \add King\add* Abimelech returned Sarah his wife to him and also gave him flocks and herds, and male and female slaves,
\v 15 and he told him, “Look, my land is in front of you. Settle wherever looks good to you.”
\v 16 Then he said to Sarah, “Listen, I’ve given 1,000 pieces of silver to your brother. That’s for you to demonstrate that you did nothing wrong, so that you’re completely cleared.”
\p
\v 17 Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his slave women so that they could have children,
\v 18 because Yahweh had made every woman in Abimelech’s household barren because of \add what had been happening to\add* Abraham’s wife, Sarah.

\p
\v 1 \add In due course,\add* Yahweh visited Sarah just as he’d said and he did for her exactly what he’d said,
\v 2 so that Sarah conceived and gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age at the very time \add of the year\add* that God had told him.\x + \xo 21:2: \xt Heb 11:11.\x*
\v 3 Abraham named their son Yitshak,
\v 4 and he circumcised him when he was eight days old, just as God had commanded him.\x + \xo 21:4: \xt Gen 17:12; Acts 7:8.\x*
\v 5 Abraham was one hundred years old when his son Yitshak was born,
\v 6 and Sarah said, “God has brought laughter to me. Everyone who hears will laugh with me.”
\v 7 And she continued, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would breastfeed children, yet I have \add given him\add* a son in his old age.”
\s1 Hagar is expelled with Ishma’el
\rem /s1 Hagar and Ishmael Are Sent Away
\p
\v 8 The child grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a large feast on the day Yitshak was weaned.
\p
\v 9 \add But\add* Sarah noticed that \add Ishma’el\add* (the son of Hagar the Egyptian who she had given birth to for Abraham) was mocking,
\v 10 so \add Sarah\add* said to Abraham, “Get rid of that slave woman and her son, because that slave woman’s son won’t be inheriting \add anything along\add* with my son Yitshak.”\x + \xo 21:10: \xt Gal 4:29-30.\x*
\v 11 Now this stressed out Abraham \add who also cared for that\add* son,
\v 12 but God told him, “Don’t get distressed because of the boy and your slave woman. Listen to what Sarah’s telling you, because it’s in Yitshak that your descendants will be called yours.\x + \xo 21:12: \xt Rom 9:7; Heb 11:18.\x*
\v 13 \add But\add* I’ll also make the descendants of the slave woman’s son into a nation, because he’s \add also\add* your \add son\add*.”
\p
\v 14 Abraham got up early the \add next\add* morning, and got some bread and a skin of water and helped Hagar put them on her shoulder. Then he gave her the child and sent her away, and she left and wandered in the wilderness around Beersheba.
\v 15 \add But\add* when the water from the skin was gone, she threw the child under one of the bushes,
\v 16 and she went and she went a short distance away (about as far as a bow can shoot an arrow) and sat down there, because she said, “I don’t want to watch my child die.” And as she sat at a distance, she sobbed loudly.
\p
\v 17 Now God heard the boy’s voice, so \add one of\add* God’s messengers called Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What’s the matter, Hagar? Don’t be afraid, because God has heard the boy’s voice over there.
\v 18 Get up and get the boy and hold on to him by the hand, because I’ll make \add his descendants\add* into a great nation.”
\v 19 Then God \add enabled her to see\add* a well, so she went and filled the skin with water and gave the boy a drink.
\p
\v 20 As the boy grew up, God \add kept watch over\add* him, and he lived in the wilderness and became an \add expert with the bow and arrow\add*.
\v 21 He settled in the Paran wilderness, and \add in due course\add* his mother found an Egyptian girl for him to marry.
\s1 Abraham and Abimelech’s agreement
\rem /s1 Abraham and Abimelech Make a Covenant; A Treaty with Abimelech; The Treaty at Beersheba; The Agreement between Abraham and Abimelech
\p
\v 22 \add One day \add King\add* Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, spoke to Abraham, saying, “\add We can see that\add* God is with you in everything you do.\add* \x + \xo 21:22: \xt Gen 26:26.\x*
\v 23 So then, swear to me here by God \add that you won’t treat\add* me or my children or my descendants \add badly\add*, and that’ll you’ll be kind to this country just as I showed kindness to you.”
\p
\v 24 “I swear it,” Abraham replied.
\p
\v 25 \add But\add* Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that had been taken over by Abimelech’s slaves.
\v 26 “I don’t know who did that,” Abimelech responded, “and you hadn’t told me about it, so I’ve only just heard about it today.”
\v 27 Then Abraham gave \add some\add* sheep and cattle to Abimelech to confirm their agreement together,
\v 28 and \add then\add* he separated seven female lambs from the rest of the flock.
\v 29 “Why did you pen those seven lambs,” Abimelech asked.
\p
\v 30 “Because I want you to take them,” Abraham insisted. “I want them to be the verification that it was \em me\em* who dug this well.”
\v 31 So that’s why the place was named ‘Beersheba’ \add (which means ‘Well of the seven’ or ‘Well of the oath’)\add*, because that’s where the two of them made their agreement.
\p
\v 32 So the agreement was made at Beersheba, then Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, got up and returned \add home\add* to the Philistine region.
\v 33 Then \add Abraham\add* planted a tamarisk tree there at Beersheba, and he prayed to Yahweh, the God of eternity.
\v 34 Then Abraham continued his stay in the Philistine region for quite some time.

\s1 God tests Abraham over Yitshak

\p
\v 1 \add Several years later,\add* God \add decided to\add* test Abraham, calling him, “Abraham.”\x + \xo 22:1-13: \xt Heb 11:17-19.\x*
\p “Here I am,” he replied.
\p
\v 2 “Take your son Yitshak who you love, your only son,” God commanded him, “and go to the Moriah region and sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I’ll \add point out\add* to you.”\x + \xo 22:2: \xt 2Ch 3:1.\x*
\p
\v 3 So Abraham got up early in the morning and saddled his donkey. Then he took two of his young men with him and his son Yitshak, and he cut \add some\add* firewood for the burnt offering. Then they left to go to the place that God had told him.
\v 4 On the third day Abraham \add looked up ahead\add* and he could see the place from a distance,
\v 5 so he said to his young men, “Stay here by yourselves with the donkey while the boy and I go over there to \add worship God\add*, then we’ll come back to you \add here\add*.”
\p
\v 6 So Abraham took the firewood for the burnt offering and put it on his son Yitshak, and he carried the fire pot and the knife. Then the two of them went on together,
\v 7 and Yitshak asked his father Abraham his father, “My father?”
\p “Yes, son?”, he replied.
\p “We’ve got the fire and the wood,”, he continued, “but where’s the lamb for the burnt offering?”
\p
\v 8 “God will provide the lamb for the burnt offering himself, my son,” Abraham answered, and then the two of them continued on together.
\p
\v 9 Then they came to the place that God had told him, and Abraham built an altar there and arranged the firewood \add on it\add*. Then he tied up his son Yitshak and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.\x + \xo 22:9: \xt Jam 2:21.\x*
\v 10 Then Abraham took the knife and raised his arm to kill his son,
\v 11 but one of Yahweh’s messengers called to him from the sky and said, “Abraham! Abraham!”
\p “Here I am.” he answered.
\p
\v 12 “Don’t lift up your hand against the boy,” \add the messenger\add* continued. “And don’t do anything to him, because now I know that you \add respect and obey\add* God, since you haven’t withheld your son, your only son, from me.”
\p
\v 13 Then Abraham raised his head and looked around, and wow, there was a ram was behind him, caught by its horns in the thicket. So Abraham went and grabbed the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering instead of his son.
\v 14 So Abraham named that place ‘Yahweh will provide’, and to this day it’s still said, “Yahweh will provide on his mountain.”
\p
\v 15 Then the Yahweh’s messenger called Abraham from the sky a second time
\v 16 saying, “I, Yahweh, make this declaration by my \add authority and truth\add* that because you did that and didn’t withhold your only son,\x + \xo 22:16-17: \xt Heb 6:13-14.\x*
\v 17 I’ll bless you tremendously and I’ll cause your descendants to be \add as numerous\add* as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the beach, and your descendants will be victorious over their enemies.\x + \xo 22:17: \xt Heb 11:12.\x*
\v 18 Because you obeyed what I said, all the nations of the earth will be blessed through your descendants.”\x + \xo 22:18: \xt Acts 3:25.\x*

\v 1 Sarah went on to be 127 years old
\v 2 when she died in \add the city of\add* Kiriath Arba (now \add called\add* Hebron) in the Canaan region. Abraham went in \add by her bed\add* to weep and mourn for her.
\p
\v 3 \add After a time,\add* Abraham got up from beside his dead \add wife\add* and he spoke to Het’s sons, \add requesting\add*,
\v 4 “I’m a foreigner and just staying among you. Give me property for a burial place \add on your land\add* so that I can bury my dead \add wife\add*.”\x + \xo 23:4: \xt Heb 11:9,13; Acts 7:16.\x*
\p
\v 5 Het’s sons replied to Abraham, telling him,
\v 6 “My master, listen to us. You’re a mighty prince among us. \add Go ahead and\add* bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places. We’ve all agreed not to prevent you from burying your dead in any of our cemeteries.”
\p
\v 7 Then Abraham stood and bowed to the Het’s sons who were the owners of the land,
\v 8 and \add asked\add* them, “Since you’re all allowing me to bury my dead, listen to me and intercede for me with Zohar’s son Efron,
\v 9 so that he’ll \add sell\add* me Machpelah’s cave which belongs to him and which is at the end of his field. \add I’ll pay\add* full price if he’ll give it to me to use as a burial place.”
\p
\v 10 Now Efron (the Hittite) was sitting \add there\add* among Het’s sons, so he responded to Abraham while the other \add land-owners\add* were listening, along with everyone else at the city gate,
\v 11 “No, my master. Listen to me: I’ll \em give\em* you the field and the cave that’s in it. I give it to you in front of all these others, then you can bury your dead.”
\p
\v 12 Then Abraham bowed before the people of the land,
\v 13 and he told Efron while all the others were listening, “But if you would, please listen to me. I’ll \add pay\add* the \add value\add* of the field. Accept it from me, then I’ll bury my dead there.”
\p
\v 14 Efron responded to Abraham,
\v 15 “My master, listen to me. That land’s worth 400 shekels of silver, but that’s nothing between me and you. \add Just go ahead\add* and bury your dead.”
\v 16 So Abraham accepted Efron’s words and weighed out for Efron the price that he had mentioned in the hearing of Het’s sons: 400 shekels of silver (the currency among the merchants).
\p
\v 17 So Efron’s field that was in Machpelah which faced Mamre (including the field and the cave that was in it, and all the trees that were in the field that was within all of its surrounding borders) was deeded
\v 18 to Abraham as the new owner as witnessed by Het’s son and everyone \add else\add* who had come to the city gate.
\v 19 Then after that, Abraham \add laid the body of\add* his wife Sarah to rest in the cave in Machpelah’s field facing Mamre (also called Hebron, in the Canaan region).
\v 20 So the field was deeded as property to Abraham by Het’s sons, including the cave in it for a burial place.

\s1 Yitshak’s marriage
\rem /s1 A Wife for Isaac; Isaac and Rebecca; Isaac and Rebekah; The Marriage of Isaac and Rebekah; Isaac Marries Rebekah
\p
\v 1 Abraham was now getting very old, and Yahweh had blessed him in every way.
\v 2 Then Abraham said to his oldest slave of his household who was in charge of everything that belonged to him, “Please put your hand under my thigh,
\v 3 and I want you to vow by Yahweh, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth, that you won’t select a wife for my son \add Yitshak\add* from any of the Canaanite women in this area where we’re living.
\v 4 Rather, you should go \add back\add* to my country and to my relatives, and find a wife for \add him there\add*.”
\p
\v 5 “Suppose the woman isn’t willing to come \add back\add* with me to this place?” the slave asked. “Should I take your son back to the country that you came from?”
\p
\v 6 “Make sure that you don’t take my son back there,” Abraham answered.
\v 7 “Yahweh, the God of the heavens, who took me from my father’s house and from the land of my relatives, and who spoke to me and who promised me, saying, ‘I’ll give this land to your descendants,’ he’ll send his messenger ahead of you, and you’ll \add be guaranteed to\add* bring back a wife for my son from there.
\v 8 If \add it turned out that\add* the woman isn’t willing to come \add back\add* with you, then you’re released from this vow \add to me\add*. \add But still in that case,\add* don’t take my son back there!”
\v 9 Then the slave put his hand under the thigh of his master Abraham and promised his \add that he’d follow those instructions.\add*.
\p
\v 10 Then the slave took ten of his master’s camels and \add loaded them with\add* all kinds of good things from his master, and \add with his own slaves,\add* he travelled to the city of Nahor in the Aram Naharaim \add region\add*.
\v 11 Then on that first evening, he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well. It was the time that women come out to fetch water,
\v 12 and he prayed, “Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, please cause it to happen right in front of me today that you show kindness toward my master Abraham.
\v 13 See, I’m standing by this \add well\add*, and the young women from the city will be coming out \add here\add* to fetch water.
\v 14 Let it be that if I say to a young woman, ‘Please let me have a drink from your water jar,’ and she says, ‘Sure, and I’ll also get more for your camels,’ let her be the one you have appointed for your slave Yitshak. And by \add finding\add* her, I’ll know that you’ve shown kindness toward my master.”
\p
\v 15 Now before he’d even finished speaking, then wow, Rebekah arrived with her \add empty\add* water jar on her shoulder. (She was Bethuel’s daughter—Bethuel being the son of Abraham’s brother Nahor and his wife Milcah.)
\v 16 The young woman was very beautiful and a virgin who hadn’t slept with a man. She went down to the well and filled her jar and came \add back\add* up.
\v 17 The slave ran to meet her and said, “Can I have a small drink of water from your jar.”
\p
\v 18 “Drink, my master,” she said and quickly lowered her jar to her hands and gave him a drink,
\v 19 and after she’d finished giving him a drink, she said, “I’ll also get water for your camels until they have finished drinking.”
\v 20 Then she hurried and emptied her jar into the trough and ran back to the well to draw \add more\add* water, and she drew \add enough\add* water for all his camels
\v 21 \add while Abraham’s slave\add* watched her silently to determine whether Yahweh had made his journey successful or not.
\p
\v 22 Then when the camels had finished drinking, the slave took out an \add expensive\add* gold nose ring and two \add solid\add* gold bracelets for her arms.
\v 23 “Tell me, whose daughter are you?” he asked her. “Is there room at your father’s house for us to stay?”
\p
\v 24 “I’m Bethuel’s daughter. He’s the son of Nahor and Milcah,” she answered.
\v 25 “We’ve got plenty of both straw and fodder \add for the camels\add*, and there’s also a room where you could stay.”
\p
\v 26 Then the \add slave\add* bowed down and worshipped Yahweh
\v 27 and said, “Praised be Yahweh, my master Abraham’s God, who hasn’t relented from his kindness and faithfulness toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me on the road to the home of my master’s relatives.”
\p
\v 28 Then the young woman ran \add home\add* and told her mother’s household what had happened.
\v 29 Now Rebekah had a brother named Lavan (Laban), and he ran out to the man at the well.
\v 30 He had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and when he’d heard his sister Rebekah’s words saying, “This is what the man said to me,” then he went to the man, and indeed, he was \add there\add* standing by the camels at the spring
\v 31 and he \add invited him\add*, “Come, you who’re blessed by Yahweh. Why are you standing out here? I’ve \add already\add* prepared the house and a place for the camels.”
\p
\v 32 So \add Abraham’s slave\add* went to the house. Then he unloaded the camels and gave them straw and fodder, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.\f + \fr 24:32 \ft It’s not certain from the pronouns in the text here, just who did what in this second sentence—whether it was the slave (the guest) or Lavan (the host), so other translations might vary.\f*
\v 33 Then food was set out for \add them\add* to eat, but \add Abraham’s slave\add* said, “I won’t eat until I have \add said what I have to say\add*.”
\p “Speak then,” Lavan responded.
\p
\v 34 “I’m one of Abraham’s slaves,” he said,
\v 35 and Yahweh has blessed my master a lot, so that he has become wealthy. \add Yahweh\add* has given him cattle, sheep and goats, silver and gold, male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.
\v 36 And my master’s wife Sarah gave birth to a son for my master \add despite\add* her old age, and \add my master\add* has given him everything that he owns.
\v 37 My master made me promise, saying, ‘You mustn’t get a wife for my son from Canaanite women whose land I am living in,
\v 38 but rather you must go to my father’s house and to my clan, and find a wife for my son \add there\add*.’
\v 39 Then I \add asked\add* my master, ‘Suppose the woman \add refuses\add* to come with me?’
\v 40 And he \add replied\add*, ‘\add The God\add* Yahweh that I obey, he’ll send his messenger with you and make your journey succeed, so that you’ll find a wife for my son from my clan, and from my father’s house.
\v 41 Then you’ll be free of your promise: When you go to my clan, and if they won’t allow her to \add return with\add* you, then you’ll be clear from \add this promise\add*.’
\p
\v 42 “Then today I came to the well, and I said, ‘Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, if it’s what you want, make my journey succeed that I have come on.
\v 43 Listen, I’m standing by this well, so let it be that the young woman who comes out to fetch water and I say to her, “Please give me a little water to drink from your jar,”
\v 44 and she replies to me, “Sure, drink, and I will also get water for your camels,” let her be the wife that Yahweh has chosen for the my master’s son.’
\v 45 Before I’d finished speaking in my heart, then wow, Rebekah was coming out with her jar on her shoulder. And she went down to the well and drew water, and I asked her, ‘Can I have a drink.’
\v 46 So she hurried and lowered her jar from her \add shoulder\add* and said, ‘Drink, and I’ll also water your camels.’ So I drank and she also watered the camels.
\v 47 Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, a son of Nahor and his wife Milcah.’ Then I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms.
\v 48 Then I bowed down and worshipped and praised my master Abraham’s God Yahweh, who led me on the right way to \add find\add* the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.
\v 49 And now if you all want to show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me. But if not, tell me, so that I \add can decide what to do next\add*.”
\p
\v 50 Then Lavan and Bethuel answered, “This matter has come from Yahweh, \add so\add* we’re not able to tell you bad or good.
\v 51 \add But\add* listen, Rebekah’s \add right here\add*. Take her and go, and let her become the wife of your master’s son, as Yahweh has \add indicated\add*.”
\v 52 \add Now\add* when Abraham’s slave heard their \add reply\add*, he bowed down to the ground before Yahweh.
\v 53 Then \add he\add* brought out silver and gold jewelry, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. And he gave valuable things to her brother and her mother.
\p
\v 54 Then \add Abraham’s slave\add* and the men with him ate and drank and stayed \add there overnight\add*. Then in the morning they got up, and he said, “\add Let\add* me \add leave now and return back\add* to my master.”
\p
\v 55 But \add Rebekah’s\add* brother and her mother said, “Let the girl stay with us a few days, at least ten. After \add that\add* she can go.”
\p
\v 56 “Don’t detain me,” he told them, “since Yahweh has made my journey successful. Send me off so that I \add can return\add* to my master.”
\p
\v 57 “Let’s call for the young woman and \add find out what she wants to do\add*.” they responded.
\v 58 So they called for Rebekah and asked her, “Are you \add prepared to leave now\add* with this man?”
\p “\add Yes,\add* I’ll go.” she answered.
\p
\v 59 \add So\add* they \add got ready to\add* send off their sister Rebekah with Abraham’s slave and his men, along with her \add childhood\add* nurse.
\v 60 They \add prayed\add* a blessed for Rebekah, saying
\q1 “Our sister, may you become the mother of thousands,
\q1 and may your descendants defeat all of their enemies.”
\m
\v 61 Then Rebekah got up with her maids, and they mounted the camels and went with the man. So the slave took Rebekah and left.
\p
\v 62 Meanwhile Yitshak was living in the Negev region, and \add had just returned from visiting\add* Be’er-Lahai-Roi.
\v 63 Late on afternoon, he went out to a field to meditate, and when he looked up, he saw some camels approaching.
\v 64 Rebekah \add also\add* looked up and saw Yitshak, and dismounted from her camel,
\v 65 asking the slave, “Who’s that man in the field who is coming to meet us?”
\p “He’s my master,” the slave replied, so she took the veil and covered herself.
\p
\v 66 Then the slave reported everything that he’d done to Yitshak.
\v 67 Then Yitshak brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, and he took Rebekah as his wife. And Yitshak loved her and he was comforted after his mother\add ’s death\add*.

\v 19 These are the generations of Abraham’s son Yitshak: Abraham fathered Yitshak
\v 20 and Yitshak was forty years old when he married Rebekah. (She was the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram, the sister of Lavan the Aramean.)
\v 21 \add In due course,\add* Yitshak prayed to Yahweh on his wife’s behalf because she was barren. Yahweh \add answered his prayer\add* and his wife Rebekah got pregnant,
\v 22 \add but the twins kept jostling\add* each other within her \add womb\add*, so she asked, “Why’s this happening to me?” She \add also\add* asked Yahweh about it

\q1 “There’s two nations inside your womb—
\q2 two \add different\add* peoples will come from within you.

\p
\v 24 When the time came to give birth, she gave birth to twin \add boys\add*.
\v 25 The firstborn came out quite red and covered with hair like a fur coat, so they named him ‘Esaw’ \add (which means ‘hairy’)\add*.
\v 26 Then his brother was born and his hand grabbed Esaw’s heel, so he was named ‘Yacob’ \add (which means ‘heel-grabber’)\add*. Yitshak was sixty years old when they were born.

\p
\v 1 Then there was a famine in the region (a different one from the earlier famine that was in the days of Abraham) so Yitshak \add moved\add* to Gerar, \add the region of\add* Abimelech, the Philistines king.
\v 2 Then Yahweh appeared to \add Yitshak\add* and told him, “Don’t go down to Egypt—stay in the area that I’ll tell you.
\v 3 Stay as a guest in this region, and I’ll be with you and bless you, because I’ll give all this land to you and to your descendants, and I’ll confirm the oath that I made to your father Abraham.\x + \xo 26:3-4: \xt Gen 22:16-18.\x*

\v 5 because Abraham obeyed me by keeping my requirements, my commands, my decrees, and my laws.”
\p
\v 6 So Yitshak settled \add there\add* in Gerar.
\v 7 Then the men of the place asked about his wife, and he said, “She’s my sister,” because he was afraid to say, “She’s my wife.” He was thinking, “What if the men in this place kill me because Rebekah is so beautiful to look at.”\x + \xo 26:7: \xt Gen 12:13; 20:2.\x*
\v 8 Then when he’d been in that area for quite a while, the Philistine King Abimelech looked down from a window and saw that \add to his surprise\add*, Yitshak was laughing \add together\add* with his wife Rebekah.
\v 9 So Abimelech called for Yitshak and said, “Hey, she’s really your wife! So how could you say, ‘She’s my sister’?”
\p “Because I said \add to myself\add*, ‘I might die because of her.’,” Yitshak replied.
\p
\v 10 “What’s this that you’ve done to us?” continued Abimelech. “One of \add my\add* people might easily have slept with your wife and you would have brought condemnation onto us!”
\v 11 Then \add King\add* Abimelech ordered all the people, “Whoever touches this man or his wife will certainly be killed.”

\p
\v 12 Then Yitshak \add planted a crop\add* in that land and Yahweh blessed him and gave him one hundred times as much as he’d planted.
\v 13 Hence he became \add wealthier\add* and that repeated until \add eventually\add* he was \add very powerful\add*.
\v 14 He \add also\add* owned sheep and goats, and cattle, and many slaves. \add Because\add* the Philistines \add now\add* envied him,
\v 15 they blocked up all the wells that his father’s slaves had dug when his father Abraham had been alive, and they filled them with dirt.
\p
\v 16 Then \add King\add* Abimelech told Yitshak, “You all \add need to\add* leave this area because you’ve become more powerful than us.”
\v 17 So Yitshak left that place and set up camp in the Gerar Valley and settled there.
\v 18 Then he returned and dug out the water wells that they had dug in the days of Abraham his father and that the Philistines had blocked up after Abraham’s death, and he called them similar names to the ones that his father had called them.
\p
\v 19 Then Yitshak’s slaves dug in the valley and found an \add underground\add* spring with flowing water there.
\v 20 But the herdsmen from Gerar quarreled with Yitshak’s herdsmen, saying, “The water belongs to us.” So he named the well ‘Esek’ \add (which means ‘dispute’)\add*, because they disputed with him.
\p
\v 21 \add Yitshak’s men\add* dug another well, but they quarreled over it too, so he named it ‘Sitnah’ \add (which means ‘opposition’)\add*.
\v 22 Then he moved from there and dug another well, and they didn’t quarrel over it, so he named it ‘Rehoboth’ \add (which means ‘space’)\add*, and he said, “Because now Yahweh has made space for us and we’ll be productive in this area.”
\p
\v 23 Then from there Yitshak moved \add down\add* to Beer-Sheba,
\v 24 and Yahweh appeared to him during that night and said, “I am the God of your father Abraham. Don’t be afraid, because I’m with you and I will bless you and multiply your descendants for the sake of my slave Abraham.”
\v 25 So Yitshak built an altar there and he prayed to Yahweh. He set up his tents there and his slaves dug a well there.

\v 28 “We have clearly seen that Yahweh has been with you,” they \add answered\add*, “so we said, ‘There should be an agreement between us’—between us and you. So let us make an agreement with you,

\p “\add I’m here\add*,” Esau replied.
\p
\v 2 “Please listen,” Yitshak \add continued\add*, “I’m old and don’t know how long I’ve got before I die.
\v 3 So please take your weapons—your quiver, and your bow—and go out into the field\add s\add* and hunt game for me
\v 4 and cook me a tasty meal in the way that I love it, and bring it to me so I can eat it, so that \add I\add* can bless you before I die.”
\p
\v 5 \add Now\add* Rebekah had been listening while Yitshak spoke to Esau. Then Esau went \add out\add* to the field\add s\add* to hunt game and bring it back.
\v 6 \add Meanwhile\add* Rebekah said to her son Yacob, “Listen, I heard your father speaking to your brother Esau, saying,
\v 7 ‘Get \add some\add* game \add meat\add* for me and prepare me a tasty meal so that I can eat it, and \add then\add* I can bless you in Yahweh’s presence before I die.’
\v 8 So now \add Yacob\add*, listen to what I tell you:
\v 9 Go \add out\add* to the flock and get me two of the \add best\add* young goats so that I can prepare a tasty meal from them that your father loves.
\v 10 Then you \add can\add* take it \add in\add* to your father, and \add after\add* he’s eaten it he’ll bless you before he dies.”
\p
\v 11 “Look,” Yacob said to his mother, “My brother Esau is \add very\add* hairy, whereas \add my skin\add* is smooth.
\v 12 What if my father touches me? Then he’ll think of me as a deceiver and \add he’ll\add* curse me rather than bless me.”
\p
\v 13 “Let your curse be on me, my son,” his mother \add replied\add*, “Just \add do\add* what I said and go get \add the young goats\add* for me.”
\v 14 \add So\add* he went and \add slaughtered them\add* and brought \add them\add* to his mother. Then \add she\add* prepared tasty food the way his father loved \add it\add*.
\v 15 \add She then\add* got Esau’s best clothes that were in the house and \add got\add* her younger son Yacob to put \add them\add* on,
\v 16 then she \add tied\add* the skins of the young goats \add over\add* his hands and \add around\add* the smooth part of his neck.
\p
\v 17 Then she \add handed\add* the tasty food and the bread to Yacob,
\v 18 and he went \add in\add* to his \add elderly\add* father and said, “My father.”
\p “I’m here,” \add he\add* said, “Which son are you?”
\v 19 “I’m your oldest son Esau,” Yacob\add replied\add* to his father. “I’ve done what you told me. Please get up, \add and come and\add* sit up and eat some of my game, so that you’ll bless me.”
\v 20 “How did you find it so quickly, my son?” Yitshak \add asked\add*.
\p “Because your God Yahweh \add helped me when I went out hunting\add*,” Yacob \add answered\add*.
\p
\v 21 Then Yitshak said to Yacob, “Please come close so that I can touch you, my son, and \add to be sure\add* whether you’re really my son Esau or not.”
\v 22 So Yacob went close to his father and \add Yitshak\add* felt \add his skin\add* and said \add to himself\add*, “It’s Yacob’s voice, but \add these\add* are \add definitely\add* Esau’s hands.”
\v 23 So he didn’t recognise \add that it was Yacob\add*, because his hands were hairy like Easu’s hands, so he was about to bless him
\v 24 \add but asked once more,\add* “Are you really my son Esau?”
\p “\add Yes,\add* I am,” Yacob answered.
\p
\v 25 \add So Yitshak told him\add*, “Bring the food \add here\add* and I’ll eat some of my son’s game, so that my \add I can then\add* bless you.” \add So Yacob\add* took it to him and he ate, and then he brought wine to him and he drank.

\v 3 And may the powerful God bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you so that you become a community of peoples.
\v 4 May he give the \add same\add* blessing of Abraham to you—to you and to your offspring with you—so that you will own the land where you’ve been staying and which God gave to Abraham.”\x + \xo 28:4: \xt Gen 17:4-8.\x*
\v 5 Then Yitshak sent Yacob \add away\add*, and he went to Paddan Aram—to Lavan, the son of Bethuel the Aramean and the brother of Yacob and Esau’s mother Rebekah.

\p
\v 6 Now Esau noticed that Yitshak had blessed Yacob and sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife for himself from there. \add He’d also noticed\add* that when \add Yitshak\add* had blessed him, he’d instructed him not to take a wife from the Canaanite girls,
\v 7 and that Yacob had listened to his parents and travelled to Paddan Aram.
\v 8 \add As a result,\add* Esau \add realised\add* that his father wasn’t happy about the Canaanite girls
\v 9 so \add he\add* went to Ishma’el and he took Mahalath as an additional wife. She was the daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael, and was the sister of Nevayot.

\rem /s1 Jacob’s Dream at Bethel
\p
\v 10 \add Meanwhile,\add* Yacob had left Beersheba and was enroute to Haran.
\v 11 \add One night\add* after he’d stopped when the sun had gone down, he laid down in that place and used one of the stones there to put under his head \add for a pillow\add*.
\v 12 \add While he was sleeping,\add* he had a dream, and wow, a stairway was set up on the earth and its top reached to the heavens, and look, God’s messengers were ascending and descending on it.\x + \xo 28:12: \xt Jn 1:51.\x*
\v 13 And look, Yahweh was standing above it and he said, “I am Yahweh, the God of Abraham your grandfather and the God of Yitshak. I will give the land that you are lying on to you and to your descendants\x + \xo 28:13: \xt Gen 13:14-15.\x*
\v 14 and \add they\add* will be \add as numerous as\add* dust \add particles\add*, and you’ll \add all\add* spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south. And all the families of the earth will be blessed \add through\add* you and your offspring.\x + \xo 28:14: \xt Gen 12:3; 22:18.\x*
\v 15 \add So\add* listen, I’m with you and I’ll watch over you everywhere you go. I’ll bring you back to this land because I won’t leave you until I’ve done what I told you.”
\p
\v 16 Then Yacob woke up and said \add to himself\add*, “Yahweh is certainly \add here\add* in this place, but I didn’t realise it.”
\v 17 So he was afraid and said \add to himself\add*, “This place is spine-chilling—it’s nothing other than God’s house, and it’s heaven’s gateway.”
\p
\v 18 Then in the morning Yacob got up early, and he took the stone that he’d put under his head and stood it up \add longways\add* as a pillar, and he poured oil over the top of it.
\v 19 He named that place ‘Beyt-el’ \add (which means ‘God’s house’)\add*, even though that town had been named Luz before then.
\v 20 Then Yacob made a promise \add to God\add*, saying, “If God will be with me and watch over me on this road that I’m walking on, and give me bread to eat and clothes to wear,
\v 21 and if I’m \add able to\add* return \add safely\add* to my father’s home, then I’ll make Yahweh my God,
\v 22 and this stone that I’ve stood up as a pillar will be God’s house, and I’ll give you a tenth of everything that you give to me.”

\rem /s1 Jacob Arrives in Paddan Aram; Jacob Arrives at Laban’s Home; Jacob Meets Rachel; Jacob Arrives at Paddan-Aram
\p
\v 1 Then Yacob \add got on the road again\add* and went to the land of the eastern peoples.
\v 2 \add Close to his destination,\add* he looked \add ahead\add*, and wow, there was a well in the field, and what’s more, three flocks of sheep and goats were lying there near it, because the flocks were watered from that well \add but\add* the stone over the mouth of the well was large \add and heavy\add*.
\v 3 \add Once\add* all the flocks were gathered there, then they would roll the stone from over the mouth of the well and water the \add animals\add*. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.
\p
\v 4 \add So\add* Yacob \add asked the farmers\add*, “My brothers, where are you from?”
\p “We’re from Haran,” they \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 5 “Do you know Nahor’s grandson Lavan?” Yacob asked.
\p “\add Yes,\add* we know him,” they \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 6 “Is he doing well?” Yacob asked.
\p “\add Yes,\add* he’s fine,” they said, “and here comes his daughter Rahel with \add their\add* flock.”
\p
\v 7 “Look, it’s still \add broad daylight\add*,” Yacob told them. “It’s not time for the livestock to be brought it. Water the flock, and go pasture them.”
\p
\v 8 “We can’t,” they said, “until \em all\em* the flocks are gathered \add here\add* and they roll the stone off the \add top\add* of the well. Then we will water the sheep.”
\p
\v 9 He was still talking with them when Rahel came with her father’s flock, because she was \add the one who looked after\add* them.
\v 10 When Yacob saw Rahel (the daughter of his mother’s brother, Lavan) with Lavan’s flock, \add he\add* went over and rolled the stone \add off the top\add* of the well and watered the sheep and goats.
\v 11 Then \add he gave\add* Rahel \add a kiss\add* and \add happily\add* cried \add out loud\add*.
\v 12 Then \add he\add* told Rahel that he was a relative of her father and that he was a son of Rebekah.
\p Then she ran and told her father,
\v 13 and when Lavan heard the news about his sister’s son Yacob, he ran \add out\add* to meet him. Then he embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Then \add Yacob\add* told Lavan \add everything that had happened up until then\add*,
\v 14 and Lavan told him, “You are indeed \add a close relative\add*.”

\p After Yacob had stayed with Lavan and \add worked for him\add* for a whole month,
\v 15 Lavan said to \add him\add*, “Should you work for me for nothing just because you’re my relative? Tell me, what \add should I pay you\add*?”
\p
\v 16 Now Lavan had two daughters: the older one was named Le’ah, and the younger one was named Rahel (Rachel).
\v 17 Le’ah had \add pretty\add* eyes, but Rahel was \add extremely beautiful in every way\add*.
\p
\v 18 \add Now\add* Yacob \add was in love with\add* Rahel, so he \add answered\add*, “I’ll \add work for\add* you \add for\add* seven years \add so I can marry\add* your younger daughter Rahel.”
\p
\v 19 “\add Ok,\add* stay with me \add then\add*,” said Lavan. “It’s better for me to give her to you than to give her to some other man.”
\p
\v 20 So Yacob \add worked\add* seven years for Rahel, but \add it only seemed\add* like a few days \add to him\add* because of his love for her,
\v 21 then \add he\add* said to Lanan, “Give me my wife \add to marry now\add* because \add I’ve worked the agreed seven years\add*.”
\v 22 \add So\add* Lavan invited all the local people and held a wedding reception,
\v 23 but that evening Lavan \add brought\add* his \add other\add* daughter Le’ah to \add Yacob\add*, and he \add slept with\add* her.
\v 24 (Lavan also gave his female slave Zilpah to Le’ah to be \add her personal\add* slave.)
\v 25 \add But\add* in the morning, \add Yacob saw\add* that wow, it was Leah! “\add Hey,\add* what’s this \add that\add* you’ve done to me?” Yacob \add demanded of\add* Lavan. “Wasn’t it Rahel that I \add worked for\add* you for? So why did you deceive me?”
\p
\v 26 “It’s not our custom here,” Lavan answered, “for the younger \add daughter\add* to marry before the older one.
\v 27 Stay with \add just\add* this one for the \add marriage\add* week, and \add then\add* we’ll also give you the \add younger\add* one \add in return for\add* another seven year’s work.”
\p
\v 28 \add So\add* Yacob agreed and \add spent the week with Le’ah\add*, then \add Lavan also\add* gave him his daughter Rahel to be his wife.
\v 29 (Lavan also gave his female slave Bilhah to Rahel to be \add her personal\add* slave.)
\p
\v 30 \add So Yacob\add* also \add slept with\add* Rahel, \add but\add* he also loved \add her\add* more than Le’ah. Then he \add worked for Lavan\add* for another seven years.

\p
\v 31 \add Now\add* Yahweh saw that Le’ah was spurned, so he \add allowed her to conceive\add*, but Rahel was \add unable to get pregnant\add*.
\v 32 \add So\add* Leah \add got pregnant\add* and gave birth to a son, and she named him ‘Reuben’ \add (which means ‘Look, a son’)\add* because she said, “Because Yahweh has looked on my misery, surely my husband will love me now.”
\v 33 Then she \add got pregnant\add* again and \add gave birth to a second\add* son, and she said, “Because Yahweh heard that I am hated, then he also gave me this son.” So she called his name ‘Simeon’ \add (which means ‘he hears’)\add*.
\v 34 Then she \add got pregnant\add* again and \add gave birth to a third\add* son, and she said, “This time now my husband will hold me close to him, because I’ve \add given\add* him three sons.” That’s why she named \add the baby\add* ‘Levi’ \add (which means ‘hold close’)\add*.
\v 35 Then \add Le’ah got pregnant\add* again and \add gave birth to a fourth\add* son, and she said, “This time I will praise Yahweh.” That’s why she named him ‘Yehudah’ \add (which means ‘praise’)\add*. Then she stopped \add getting pregnant\add*.
\c 30
\p
\v 1 Now Rahel \add realised\add* that she wasn’t \add producing any\add* children for Yacob, so she envied her sister \add Le’ah\add*, and she \add demanded from\add* Yacob, “Give me children, and if \add you don’t\add*, I’ll die!”
\p
\v 2 \add But\add* Yacob’s anger \add flared up\add* against Rahel and he \add asked\add*, “Am I in the place of God who’s kept you \add from getting pregnant\add*?”
\p
\v 3 \add Rahel answered\add*, “Listen, \add here’s\add* my slave Bilhah. \add Sleep with\add* her so that she’ll \add have children on my behalf\add* and I’ll also \add be able to have a family through\add* her.”
\v 4 Then she gave Bilhah to him as a \add slave\add* wife and Yacob \add slept with\add* her,
\v 5 \add so\add* then Bilhah \add got pregnant\add* and \add produced\add* a son for Yacob.
\v 6 Rahel said, “God has vindicated me, and indeed he’s listened to my \add request\add* and given me a son!” That’s why she named him ‘Dan’ \add (which means ‘he judged (in my favour)’)\add*.
\v 7 \add Later on,\add* Rahel’s slave Bilhah \add got pregnant\add* again and \add gave birth to\add* a second son for Yacob
\v 8 \add so\add* Rahel said, “I’ve \add had a difficult battle\add* with my sister but I’ve \add succeeded\add* in the end!” \add So\add* she named \add the baby\add* ‘Naftali’ \add (which means ‘my struggle’)\add*.
\p
\v 9 \add Now when\add* Le’ah \add noticed\add* that she \add wasn’t getting pregnant any more\add*, she gave her female slave Zilpah to Yacob as a \add slave\add* wife.
\v 10 Then \add eventually\add* Le’ah’s slave Zilpah \add produced\add* a son for Yacob,
\v 11 and Le’ah said, “What good fortune!” So she named him ‘Gad’ \add (which means ‘fortunate’)\add*.
\v 12 Then Le’ah’s slave Zilpah \add produced\add* a second son for Yacob,
\v 13 and Le’ah said, “How blessed I am because women will call me blessed.” So she named him ‘Asher’ \add (which means ‘blessed’)\add*.
\p
\v 14 \add One day during\add* the wheat harvest, Reuben went out and found \add some\add* mandrake \add plants\add*\f + \fr 30:14 \ft The mandrake plants were believed to increase fertility, but it’s not clear from the text which part of the plant was used or how they were applied.\f* in the field and brought them \add home\add* to Le’ah his mother. Then Rahel \add asked\add* Le’ah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.”
\p
\v 15 “Is it a small matter you have taken my husband?” Le’ah \add snapped back\add*. “And would you also take my son’s mandrakes?”
\p “\add Well,\add* he can \add sleep\add* with you tonight \add in exchange\add* for your son’s mandrakes.” Rahel \add answered\add*.
\v 16 \add So that\add* evening \add when\add* Yacob came \add home\add* from the field, Leah went out to meet him and told \add him\add*, “You must come to me \add tonight\add* because I’ve hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he \add slept\add* with her that night.
\p
\v 17 God listened to Le’ah and she \add got pregnant\add* and \add produced\add* a fifth son for Yacob,
\v 18 saying, “God has given me my reward because I gave my slave to my husband \add to sleep with\add*.” So she named him ‘Yissakar’ \add (which means ‘reward’)\add*.
\v 19 Then Le’ah \add got pregnant\add* again and \add produced\add* a sixth son for Yacob,
\v 20 saying, “God has \add given\add* me a nice present. This time my husband will honour me because I have \add produced\add* six sons for him.” So she called his name ‘Zebulun’ \add (which might mean ‘honour’)\add*.
\v 21 Later on, Le’ah had a daughter and named her Dinah.
\p
\v 22 Then God \add paid attention\add* to Rahel and listened to her and \add enabled her to conceive\add*,
\v 23 \add so\add* she \add got pregnant\add* and produced a son, and said, “God has taken away my disgrace.”
\v 24 She named him ‘Yosef’ \add (which means ‘may he give another’)\add*, saying, “May Yahweh add another son to me.”

\p
\v 25 \add Sometime\add* after Rahel had given birth to Yosef, Yacob said to Lavan, “Send me off \add now\add*, so that I can \add return\add* to my place and to my land.
\v 26 \add Let me take\add* my wives that I worked for you for, and take my children so that I can leave, because you yourself know \add how long and hard I’ve worked for\add* you.”
\p
\v 27 \add But\add* Lavan \add replied\add*, “Please stay, if I’ve found favour in your eyes \add because\add* I’ve learned by divination that Yahweh has blessed me because of you.”
\v 28 Then he \add added\add*, “Tell me how much you \add want\add* and I’ll pay you that.”
\p
\v 29 “You yourself know how \add well\add* I’ve served you and how your livestock have \add prospered\add* with me.” Yacob \add replied\add*.
\v 30 \add Before I came, you didn’t have much, but now you have plenty because\add* Yahweh has blessed you \add wherever I was involved\add*. But now, when will I also do something for my \add own\add* household?”
\p
\v 31 “What should I give you?” Lavan \add asked\add*.
\p “You don’t have to \em give\em* me anything,” Yacob \add replied\add*. “If you’ll do this \add one\add* thing for me, I’ll continue \add taking care of\add* your flocks:
\v 32 Let me look through all your flocks today and separate out from them all the lambs that are speckled, spotted, or dark-coloured, and all the young goats that are spotted or speckled. They will be my pay.
\v 33 \add So\add* in the future, you’ll be able to see that I’ve been honest because you’ll be able to see it for yourself: any goat that’s not speckled and spotted, and any sheep that’s not dark-coloured, if it’s in my flock then it must have been stolen.”
\p
\v 34 “Ok then, let’s \add do it your way\add*.” Lavan \add agreed\add*.
\v 35 \add But\add* that \add very\add* day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, any that had white on it, and all the dark-coloured ones among the lambs. Then he gave them to his sons \add to look after\add*,
\v 36 and \add they took them\add* a three-day journey \add away from where\add* Yacob \add was\add*, \add so\add* Yacob was\add left just\add* tending \em the rest\em* of Lavan’s flocks.
\p
\v 37 Then Yacob \add got some\add* freshly cut branches of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them \add by\add* exposing the white that was inside the branches.
\v 38 Then he put the branches that he had peeled in the water troughs where the flocks \add would see them when they\add* came to drink, and they mated when they came to drink.
\v 39 \add Thus\add* the flocks would mate by the \add striped\add* branches, and \add they\add* would bear young who were streaked, speckled, and spotted.
\p
\v 40 Then Yacob \add separated out those young animals into a separate flock\add*, and he made the \add older\add* flocks look at the streaked and all the dark-coloured animals in Lavan’s flocks. \add So\add* he kept his own flocks by themselves and didn’t \add mix\add* them with Lavan’s flocks.
\p
\v 41 So whenever the strong animals were \add ready to mate\add*, then Yacob put the branches in the troughs \add in front\add* of the flocks so that they would mate by the branches,
\v 42 \add but\add* when the animals were weak, he didn’t put them in. So the weak animals went to Lavan and the strong ones to Yacob
\v 43 so he \add became very wealthy\add*, and he owned large flocks \add as well as\add* male and female slaves, and camels and donkeys.

\s1 Yacob flees from Lavan
\rem /s1 Jacob Flees from Laban; Jacob Flees with Family and Flocks
\p
\v 1 \add One day, Yacob\add* overheard the words of Lavan’s sons who were saying, “Yacob has taken everything that belonged to our father, and from what \add originally\add* belonged to our father he has gained all this wealth.”
\v 2 Then Yacob \add also noticed\add* that Lavan’s \add attitude towards him had changed\add*, and he wasn’t \add in favour of him like he’d been in the past\add*.
\v 3 Then Yahweh \add told\add* Yacob, “Go back to the land of your ancestors and to your relatives, and I’ll be with you.”
\p
\v 4 \add So\add* Yacob sent for Rahel and Le’ah to \add come to him out in\add* the field \add where he was with\add* his flocks
\v 5 and he told them, “I’ve \add noticed\add* your father’s \add attitude\add* and that he’s not \add positive\add* toward me \add like he was a few days\add* ago, but my father’s God has been with me.
\v 6 You \add both\add* know that I’ve served your father with all my strength,
\v 7 \add but\add* your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times. However, God hasn’t allowed him to harm me.
\v 8 \add When he told me\add*: ‘The speckled animals will be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore speckled young. But when he \add told me\add*: ‘The streaked ones will be your wages,’ then all the flocks bore streaked young.
\v 9 \add In that way,\add* God took your father’s animals away from him and gave them to me.
\p
\v 10 “\add One day during\add* the season when the flocks were \add mating\add*, I \add looked up\add* and saw in a dream that, wow, the male goats that were mounting the flocks were streaked, speckled, and spotted.
\v 11 Then God’s messenger said to me in the dream, ‘Yacob!’ and I said, ‘\add I’m listening\add*.’
\v 12 Then he \add told me\add*, ‘Please \add look up\add* and \add observe that\add* all the male goats that are mounting the flocks are streaked, speckled, and spotted, because I have seen everything that Lavan is doing to you.
\v 13 I’m the God of Beyt-el, where you anointed a pillar—where you vowed a vow to me. Now \add pack\add* up and depart from this land, and return to the land where you were born.’ ”\x + \xo 31:13: \xt Gen 28:18-22.\x*
\p
\v 14 Then Rahel and Le’ah replied, “\add Yes,\add* we’re not expecting any portion or inheritance from our father’s \add property\add*.
\v 15 Doesn’t he just \add treat\add* us like foreigners \add now\add*? \add Yes,\add* he sold us and then he \add frittered away all the money that should have been\add* ours,
\v 16 so all the wealth that God took from our father \add belonged\add* to us and to our children \add anyway\add*. So \add yes\add*, \add go ahead and\add* do everything that God’s told you \add to do\add*.”
\p
\v 17 So Yacob \add packed\add* up and put his wives and children on the camels.
\v 18 Then he drove all his livestock and all his property that he had acquired—the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan Aram—to go \add back\add* to Isaac his father in the Canaan region.
\v 19 \add Now\add* Lavan had gone \add off for several days\add* to shear his sheep, so Rahel stole the idols that belonged to her father,
\v 20 and Yacob \add deceived\add* Lavan (the Syrian) by not telling him that \add they all\add* were leaving.
\v 21 \add So\add* Yacob \add took his household\add* and everything that belonged to \add them\add* and crossed the \add Euphrates\add* River and \add headed upward\add* toward the hill-country of Gilead.
\s1 Lavan catches up to Yacob
\rem /s1 Laban Overtakes Jacob; Laban Pursues Jacob
\p
\v 22 Three days later, Lavan was \add informed\add* that Yacob had fled \add with his family\add*,
\v 23 \add so\add* he took \add some of\add* his relatives with him and chased after Yacob \add and his family\add* for seven days until they overtook \add them\add* in the hill-country of Gilead.
\v 24 \add But\add* that night God \add appeared\add* to Lavan the Syrian in a dream and told him, “Watch yourself that you don’t \add say anything to\add* Yacob, either good or bad.”
\v 25 \add When\add* Lavan had caught up to Yacob, Yacob had pitched \add their\add* tents in the hills, so Lavan with his relatives \add also\add* pitched theirs on the Gilead hills.
\p
\v 26 Then Lavan said to Yacob, “What have you done? \add You’ve deceived me\add* and carried away my daughters like \add prisoners of war\add*.
\v 27 Why did you flee secretly and deceive me and not tell me? I would have sent you \add all off\add* with \add music and singing and a cheery party\add*.
\v 28 You didn’t let me kiss my grandchildren \add goodbye\add* and my daughters, \add instead you made a foolish decision\add*.
\v 29 \add I have the right and the ability to punish\add* you, but last night your father’s God told me, ‘\add Be careful not to\add* speak either good or bad to Yacob.’
\v 30 \add So\add* now, you probably left because you miss your father’s place badly, \add but\add* why did you steal my gods?”
\p
\v 31 “\add We left like that,\add*” Yacob answered Lavan, “because I was afraid, because I said that perhaps you would \add use force to take\add* your \add married\add* daughters from me.
\v 32 \add As for your idols,\add* whoever you find your gods with will \add be put to death\add*. Look through everything we have and take \add back anything that\add* belongs to you, with our relatives \add as witnesses\add*.” (Now Yacob didn’t know that Rahel had stolen them.)
\p
\v 33 \add So\add* Lavan \add inspected\add* Yacob’s and Le’ah’s tents, and the tent of the two slave women, but he didn’t find anything. Then he came out of Le’ah’s tent and went into Rahel’s tent.
\v 34 Now Rahel had taken the idols and put them in the camel’s saddle \add which she was now\add* sitting on, \add so although\add* Lavan searched throughout \add her\add* entire tent, he didn’t find them,
\v 35 and she said to her father, “Don’t let my master \add be upset\add* that I’m not able to stand up in your presence, because \add I have the regular female concern at the moment\add*.” So he searched, but he didn’t find the idols.
\p
\v 36 \add So\add* Yacob \add got very angry\add* and he argued with Lavan, demanding from \add him\add*, “What’s my crime? What’s my sin, that you’ve hotly chased after me?
\v 37 Since you’ve searched through all \add our\add* things, what things from \em your\em* house have you found? Put it here in front of my relatives and your relatives, and let them judge between the two of us!
\p
\v 38 “I’ve \add worked\add* for you for twenty years. Your ewes and your female goats didn’t miscarry, and I haven’t eaten rams from your flocks.
\v 39 I didn’t bring \add dead sheep or goats\add* to you \add that had been attacked by wild animals\add*—I bore the loss of \add those\add* myself. You required \add that I cover anything\add* stolen during the day or during the night.
\v 40 I was \add always out there\add*—during the day the heat \add tormented\add* me, and at night the frost \add so bad that I couldn’t sleep\add*.
\v 41 That’s how it was for me for twenty years in your house. I \add worked for you for\add* fourteen years for your two daughters, then six \add more\add* years for your flocks, and you changed my wages ten times \add to your advantage\add*.
\v 42 If my father’s God—the God of Abraham and the one Yitshak respected—had not been with me, surely you would have sent me away empty-handed now. God has seen my suffering and \add my hard work\add*, and last night, he rebuked you.”

\v 43 Then Lavan responded and told Yacob, “\add These women\add* are my daughters, and the children are my grandchildren, and the flocks are my flocks. Everything that you see \add here\add* belongs to me. But what can I do today about these daughters of mine or about their children that they gave birth to?
\v 44 \add So\add* come now, let’s make an agreement, I and you, and let it be a witness between me and you.”
\p
\v 45 So Yacob took a stone and \add stood it up longways\add* as a pillar,
\v 46 then \add he instructed\add* his relatives, “Gather stones.” So they \add fetched\add* stones and made a pile, then they ate there by the pile.
\v 47 Lavan gave the pile \add the Aramaic name\add* ‘Jegar Sahadutha’ \add (which means ‘pile that reminds’)\add* while Yacob gave it \add the Hebrew name\add* ‘Gale’ed’ \add (which has the same meaning)\add*.
\p
\v 48 Then Lavan said, “This pile is a witness \add of the agreement\add* between me and you today.” (That’s why he’d named it Galeed.)
\v 49 It’s also \add named\add* ‘Mizpah’ \add (which means ‘watchtower’)\add*, because he said, “May Yahweh watch between me and you when we are hidden one from the other.
\v 50 If you \add mistreat\add* my daughters, or if you take \add other\add* wives besides my daughters, even though there’s not someone \add there to see it\add*, listen, God \add will be\add* a witness between me and you.”
\v 51 Then Lavan said to Yacob, “Look at this pile \add of stones\add*, and look at the pillar which I set up between me and you.
\v 52 This pile is a witness and the pillar is a witness that I won’t go past these to you, and that you won’t go past these to me to do harm.
\v 53 May Abraham’s God and the gods of their ancestor Nahor judge between us.” Then Yacob swore by the one respected by his father Yitshak,
\v 54 and Yacob offered a sacrifice on the hill. Then he called his relatives to eat bread and they ate bread and spent the night on the hill.

\rem /s1 Jacob Sends Presents to Appease Esau
\p
\v 3 Then Yacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the Se’ir region in the country of Edom,
\v 4 instructing them, “This is what you’ll say to my master, to Esau: ‘This is what your servant Yacob says, “I have been staying with \add Uncle\add* Lavan and have remained there until now.
\v 5 \add Now\add* I have cattle and donkeys, flocks, and male and female slaves. And I’ve sent \add these messengers\add* to speak with my master, so that I’ll find favour in your eyes.” ’ ”
\p
\v 6 \add In due course\add* the messengers returned to Yacob, saying, “We went to your brother Esau and \add now\add* he’s coming to meet you along with his four hundred men!”
\v 7 \add This made\add* Yacob very scared and distressed, so he divided the people who were with him and the flocks and the herds and the camels into two groups,
\v 8 \add reasoning\add*, “If Esau comes and attacks one camp, then the camp that’s left can escape.”
\p
\v 9 Then \add he prayed\add*, “Yahweh, God of my grandfather Abraham, and God of my father Yitshak, who said to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives, and I will cause things to prosper with you,’
\v 10 I’m unworthy of all the kindnesses and of all the faithfulness that you have shown \add me\add* your slave, because I crossed this Jordan \add River\add* with \add only\add* my staff, but now I’ve become two camps.
\v 11 Please save me from my brother Esau, because I’m afraid that he’ll come and attack me and the mothers with the children.
\v 12 But you said,\x + \xo 32:12: \xt Gen 22:17.\x* ‘I will surely cause things to prosper with you, and I’ll make your descendants as \add numerous as\add* the sand \add grains on the beach\add* which are too many to be counted.’ ”
\p
\v 13 Then he stayed there for that night and he \add selected\add* gifts for his brother Esau from what he had with him:
\v 14 two hundred female and twenty male goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
\v 15 thirty milk camels with their young, forty cows and ten bulls, and twenty female and ten male donkeys.
\v 16 Then he \add handed them over\add* to his slaves, each herd by itself, and he \add told them\add*, “Go ahead of me \add one by one\add*, and \add keep a\add* space between each herd.”
\v 17 And he instructed the first one, saying, “When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, ‘Who do you belong to, and where are you going? And who do those animals belong to?’
\v 18 then you \add should answer\add*, ‘They belong to your servant Yacob. They are a gift sent to my master Esau. \add In fact, he’s coming along\add* behind us.’ ”
\v 19 Then \add Yacob\add* also instructed the second and third slaves, as well as everyone who followed behind the herds, \add telling them\add*, “Say the same thing to Esau when you find him,
\v 20 and also say, ‘Look, your servant Yacob is behind us.’ ” \add Yacob was thinking\add*, “I’ll \add cheer him up\add* with the gifts that are going ahead of me, and after that, when I see \add him in person\add*, perhaps he’ll \add accept me\add*.”
\v 21 \add So\add* the gifts went ahead of him, and he himself stayed in the camp for that night.

\p
\v 22 Then during that night, \add Yacob\add* got up and took his two wives and \add their\add* two female slaves and his eleven sons and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok \add Stream\add*.
\v 23 \add After\add* crossing the stream, he \add also\add* sent across \add everything else that\add* belonged to him.
\v 24 Then Yacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until dawn.\x + \xo 32:24-26: \xt Hos 12:3-4.\x*
\v 25 \add When the man realised\add* he wasn’t gaining on him, he touched \add Yacob\add* on the socket of his hip so that it became dislocated as \add they\add* wrestled with \add each other\add*.
\v 26 Then \add the man\add* said, “Release me \add now\add*, because it’s \add already\add* dawning.”
\p “I won’t release you until you bless me,” Yacob \add responded\add*.
\v 27 “What’s your name?” the man \add asked\add*.
\p “Yacob,” he \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 28 “You won’t be called Yacob anymore,” the man said, “but \add you’ll be\add* ‘Yisra’el’ \add (or ‘Israel’, which means ‘he struggled with God’)\add*, because you have struggled with God and with men, and you won.”\x + \xo 32:28: \xt Gen 35:10.\x*

\p
\v 30 \add So\add* Yacob named the place ‘Penu’el’ \add (also spelt ‘Peni’el’, which means ‘God’s face’)\add*, because he said, “I saw God face to face, yet my life was preserved.”
\v 31 And the sun rose above him as he passed through Penu’el, and he was limping because of his hip.
\v 32 That’s why Israelis don’t eat the muscle of the tendon that is on the hip socket to this day, because \add the man\add* touched the socket of Yacob’s hip on the muscle of the tendon.

\v 1 Then Yacob \add raised his head\add* and looked \add ahead\add*, and wow, Esau was coming \add towards him\add* along with \add his\add* four hundred men. Then \add Yacob quickly\add* divided the children among Le’ah and Rahel and \add their\add* two female slaves,
\v 2 and he put the slave women and their children first, and then Le’ah and her children after them, and \add finally\add* Rahel and Yosef after them.
\v 3 Then he himself went ahead of them, and he bowed to the ground seven times as he approached his brother.
\v 4 \add But\add* Esau ran \add forward\add* to meet him and embraced him and \add threw his arms around\add* his neck and kissed him, and they \add both\add* cried \add together\add*.
\v 5 Then \add Esau looked up\add* and saw the women and the children, and \add asked\add*, “Who are these \add others\add* with you?”
\p “The children that God has graciously given to your servant,” Yacob replied.
\v 6 Then the \add two\add* female slaves approached with their children, and they bowed down.
\v 7 \add Next\add* Le’ah also approached with her children, and they bowed down. Then after that, Yosef and Rahel approached, and they bowed down.
\p
\v 8 Then \add Esau asked\add*, “What were all these groups that I met?”
\p “To \add win\add* my master’s favour,” Yacob \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 9 “I’ve got plenty, my brother,” said Esau. “\add Keep\add* what belongs to you.”
\p
\v 10 “No, please,” Yacob \add insisted\add*. “If I’ve \add won\add* your favour, then take my gifts. Because indeed, I’ve seen you face-to-face, which is like seeing God’s face, and you’ve received me \add favourably\add*.
\v 11 Please take my \add gifts\add* that were brought to you, because God has been gracious to me and I have \add way more than I need\add*.”
\p And he urged him, so \add Esau\add* took it
\v 12 and said, “\add Ok,\add* let’s get moving and go, and I’ll go ahead of you.”
\p
\v 13 But \add Yacob replied\add*, “My master knows that the children are tender plus I have flocks and herds \add with young animals\add*. If they drive them \add harder today\add*, then all the flocks will die.
\v 14 Please let my master go on before his servant, and I’ll lead them on at my gentle pace—at the pace of the livestock that are ahead of me and at the pace of the children—until I come to my master’s \add place\add* in Se’ir.”

\v 15 “\add At least\add* let me leave some of my men with you \add all\add*,” said Esau.

\p
\v 1 \add One day,\add* Yacob and Le’ah’s daughter Dinah, went out to \add visit some of\add* the \add local women\add*,
\v 2 \add but\add* Shekem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of the land, saw her and he \add grabbed\add* her and \add raped\add* her.
\v 3 \add Shekem admired Dinah so much that he fell in love with her\add* and spoke \add sweetly to her to try to cultivate a relationship\add*.
\v 4 Then \add he asked\add* Hamor his father, “Get this girl for me as a wife.”
\p
\v 5 \add When\add* Yacob heard that \add Shekem\add* had dishonoured his daughter Dinah, his sons were \add out\add* in the fields with his livestock, so Yacob \add waited quietly\add* until they \add got home\add*.
\v 6 \add Meanwhile\add* Shekem’s father Hamor \add took Shekem\add* to \add negotiate\add* with Yacob.
\v 7 \add In due course\add* Yacob’s sons came \add home\add* from the fields. When they heard \add what had happened\add*, then they were \add very angry and upset\add*, because \add Shekem\add* had done something disgraceful to Yisra’el by \add taking advantage of\add* Yacob’s daughter. \add Something like that should never have happened\add*.
\v 8 \add But\add* Hamor spoke with them, saying, “My son Shekem my son \add is madly in love with\add* your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.
\v 9 \add In fact, why don’t you allow us to marry\add* your daughters, and you \add people could have\add* our daughters \add to marry\add*,
\v 10 then you could settle \add here permanently\add* with us. \add This region would open up to you all so\add* settle in it and trade \add with us\add* and \add you could\add* buy \add more land around here\add*.”
\p
\v 11 Then Shekem spoke to \add Dinah’s\add* father and brothers, “\add Look kindly on my request\add* and I’ll give \add whatever you ask for\add*.
\v 12 \add Set any very high amount for\add* the bride-price and gifts \add from\add* me, and I’ll give \add whatever you ask\add*—\add just\add* give the young woman to me as a wife.”
\p
\v 13 \add But because\add* Shekem had \add abused\add* their sister Dinah, Yacob’s sons \add gave a false answer\add* to Shekem and his father,
\v 14 \add stating\add*, “\add Sorry,\add* we can’t do that because it would be a disgrace \add in our culture\add* to allow a man with a foreskin \add to marry her\add*.
\v 15 We’d only consent \add to your proposal\add* if you’d become like us by circumcising every male among you,
\v 16 Then we’d give our daughters to you \add to marry\add*, and we’d take your daughters for us \add to marry\add*. And we’d settle among you, and we \add all\add* would become one \add united\add* people.
\v 17 \add But\add* if you all won’t \add agree\add* to get circumcised, then we’ll \add just\add* take \add Dinah\add* and go.”
\p
\v 18 \add This idea\add* pleased Hamor and his son,
\v 19 \add so Shekem\add* didn’t delay \add implementing the plan\add* because he was the most honoured son in his father’s household, and he was so delighted with Yacob’s daughter.
\p
\v 20 So Hamor and Shekem went to \add the city elders at\add* the gate of their city, and they spoke to them, saying,
\v 21 “These men are peaceful towards us, so let them settle in the land, and let them trade in it. And look, the land \add is plenty wide enough for them as well\add*. We can take their daughters for ourselves as wives, and we can give our daughters to them \add to marry\add*.
\v 22 \add But\add* they’ll only consent to settle among us and unite with us on this \add condition\add*: we would need to circumcise all of the males amongst us, just like they’re circumcised.
\v 23 Won’t all of their livestock and their property and all their animals then belong to us? \add So\add* let’s agree with \add their condition\add* and then they’ll settle among us.”
\v 24 All \add the elders\add* at the city gate \add agreed with\add* Hamor and his son Shekem, and \add so\add* every male who \add passed through\add* the city gate was circumcised.
\rem /s1 Dinah’s Brothers Avenge Their Sister
\p
\v 25 Three days later when \add all those men\add* were in pain \add from the cutting\add*, two of Yacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi who were Dinah’s brothers, took their swords and boldly attacked the city and slaughtered every male,

\v 27 Then when Yacob’s \add other sons\add* discovered that a slaughter \add had taken place\add*, they looted the city because their sister had been violated—
\v 28 taking flocks and herds and donkeys—anything the was in the city or \add out\add* in the fields.
\v 29 They captured their women and children and took all their wealth and everything that was in their houses.
\p
\v 30 \add Afterwards,\add* Yacob scolded Simeon and Levi, saying, “You \add two\add* have \add made\add* trouble for me by \add destroying my reputation with\add* those who live in the land—the Canaanites and the Perizzites. \add There’s only a few of us\add*, and if they gather together to attack me \add and my household\add*, then \add we’ll\add* be destroyed—me and \add all\add* my household.”

\v 3 Then \add we’ll leave here\add* and \add make the uphill trip\add* to Beyt-el, and I’ll make an altar there to God, who answered me \add when I was\add* distressed. He’s been with me \add wherever\add* I’ve gone.”
\v 4 So they gave Yacob all \add their idols and their earrings\add*, and \add he buried\add* them under the terebinth tree that was near Shekem.
\p
\v 5 Then they \add started their journey but\add* and the \add people of\add* the cities around them \add were afraid of Yacob’s God\add* so they didn’t \add attack them\add*.
\v 6 \add So\add* Yacob and everyone with him \add eventually arrived\add* at Luz in the Canaan region (which is \add now named\add* Beyt-el).
\v 7 He built an altar there and named the place ‘El Beyt-el’ \add (which means ‘the God of Beyt-el’)\add*, because God had revealed himself to him there when he was fleeing from his brother \add Esau\add*.
\v 8 Then Rebekah’s nurse Deborah died and was buried under the oak tree below Beyt-el \add so\add* he named \add the place\add* ‘Allon Bakut’ \add (which means ‘oak of weeping’)\add*.
\p
\v 9 \add Now that Yacob had left\add* Paddan Aram and \add come back to Beyt-el\add*, God appeared to him \add there\add* again and blessed him

\s1 Yosef’s dreams cause conflict
\rem /s1 Joseph; Joseph Dreams of Greatness; Joseph’s Dreams; Joseph and His Brothers
\p
\v 1 Yisra’el \add (Israel/Yacob/Jacob)\add* lived in the area where his father \add Yitshak\add* had stayed, in the Canaan region.
\v 2 This is \add the record of his\add* descendants:
\p When Yosef \add (Joseph)\add* was seventeen, he was shepherding the flocks with his brothers. He was \add younger than his brothers\add* who were the sons of his father’s \add slave\add* wives Bilhah and Zilpah. \add One day\add* Yosef gave a \add tell-tale\add* bad report about them to their father.
\p
\v 3 \add Now\add* Yisra’el loved Yosef more than all of his \add other\add* sons because he was \add born to him when he was already old\add*, so he made a multicoloured robe for him.
\v 4 \add When\add* his brothers saw that their father loved \add Yosef\add* more than all of his brothers, they hated him and couldn’t \add make themselves say anything nice\add* to him.
\p
\v 5 \add One night\add* Yosef had a dream, and he told his brothers about it, \add but\add* that made them hate him even more.
\v 6 He \add told\add* them, “Please \add listen about\add* this dream that I \add had\add*:
\v 7 See, we were \add tying up bundles of grain stalks\add* in the middle of a field, and wow, my bundle got up and stood upright. Then \add would you believe it\add*, your bundles gathered around and bowed down to my \add one\add*.”
\p
\v 8 “Will you really reign over us?” his brothers \add retorted\add*. “\add Do you think\add* you’ll really rule over us?” \add So\add* they continued to hate him even more because of his dreams and because of \add what he said\add*.
\p
\v 9 Then \add Yosef had\add* another dream, and \add again\add* he told his brothers, “Listen, I \add had\add* another dream, and wow, the sun and the moon and eleven stars were bowing down to me.”
\p
\v 10 \add When\add* he told his father and his brothers, his father scolded him, “What’s this dream that you \add had\add*? Will your mother and I and your brothers \add actually\add* come to bow down to the ground to you?”
\v 11 \add Consequently\add* his brothers envied him, but his father \add kept pondering it\add*.\x + \xo 37:11: \xt Acts 7:9.\x*

\p
\v 12 \add Sometime after that, Yosef’s\add* brothers went to shepherd their father’s flocks near Shekem.
\v 13 \add One day,\add* Yisra’el said to Yosef, “Aren’t your brothers \add away\add* shepherding near Shekem? Come \add we’ll get some supplies\add* and I’ll send you to them.”
\p “\add Sure\add*,” Yosef \add replied\add*.
\p
\v 14 Then he \add told\add* him, “Please go and see \add how\add* your brothers \add are doing\add* and the flocks \add as well\add*, then \add come and let me know\add*.”
\p So he sent \add Yosef off\add* from the Hebron valley, and he went to Shekem.
\v 15 \add When he got there,\add* a man \add noticed\add* him wandering around the fields and asked him, “What are you looking for?”
\p
\v 16 “I’m looking for my brothers,” he answered. “Please tell me where they’re \add looking after our flocks\add*.”
\p
\v 17 “They’ve left here,” the man responded. “I heard them say, ‘Let’s go to Dothan.’ ”
\rem /s1 Joseph Sold into Slavery
\p So Yosef continued on after his brothers and found them at Dotan,
\v 18 \add but\add* they saw him from a distance and before he \add got close\add* to them, they \add made plans among themselves\add* to kill him.
\v 19 “Look, that master \add dreamer\add* is coming,” they said to each other.
\v 20 “\add Here’s our chance to\add* kill him and throw \add his body\add* into one of the pits \add around here\add*. We’ll say that a \add wild\add* animal \add attacked\add* him. \em Then\em* we’ll see what his dreams \add turn into\add*.”
\p
\v 21 But Reuben heard \add what they were saying\add*, and he \add tried to\add* rescue \add Yosef by insisting\add*, “Let’s not \add take\add* his life.”
\v 22 “Don’t shed blood,” he continued. “Throw him into \add that\add* pit in the wilderness, but don’t \add wound\add* him.” \add He said this\add* because he was planning to rescue Yosef \add later\add* and return him \add home\add* to \add their\add* father.
\v 23 \add So\add* when Yosef \add reached\add* his brothers, they \add grabbed him and ripped\add* off the coloured robe that \add he was wearing\add*.
\v 24 Then they took him and \add dropped\add* him into the pit. (The pit was empty with no water in \add the bottom\add*).
\p
\v 25 Then they sat down to eat, and \add a bit later when they looked up\add*, look, \add there was\add* a caravan of Ishmaelites coming \add towards them\add*. \add They had left\add* Gilead carrying spices and balm and myrrh on their camels that they were going to take down to Egypt.
\v 26 Then Yehudah \add (Judah)\add* said to his brothers, “What will we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?
\v 27 Let’s sell him to \add these\add* Ishmaelites \add so we won’t be guilty of killing\add* him. \add After all,\add* he’s our brother—our \add own\add* flesh \add and blood\add*.” And his brothers \add agreed\add*.
\v 28 \add So when\add* the Midianite traders came past, \add the brothers\add* pulled Yosef up and lifted him out of the pit and sold \add him\add* to the Ishmaelites for twenty \add pieces\add* of silver. Then \add the traders took\add* Yosef \add onwards with them\add* to Mitsrayim.\x + \xo 37:28: \xt Acts 7:9.\x*
\p
\v 29 \add Later on,\add* Reuben returned to the pit, but wow, Yosef wasn’t \add down there\add*, so he tore his clothes \add in despair\add*
\v 30 and returned to his brothers and said, “The boy isn’t there. \add What am I going to do\add*?”
\p
\v 31 Then they slaughtered a young goat and took Yosef’s robe and dipped \add it\add* in the blood.
\v 32 Then they sent the coloured robe \add back\add* to their father with this message: “We found this. Please examine whether or not it’s your son’s robe.”
\p
\v 33 \add Yisra’el\add* recognised it and said, “It \em is\em* my son’s robe. A \add wild\add* animal \add must have eaten\add* him. Yosef was \add almost\add* certainly torn to pieces.”
\v 34 Then Yacob ripped his clothes and put sackcloth \add around\add* his \add waist\add*, and he mourned for his son many days.
\v 35 All his \add other\add* sons and all his daughters \add came\add* to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, “I will go down to my son in \add the grave\add* mourning.” So his father wept for him.

\s1 Yehudah mistreats Tamar
\rem /s1 Judah and Tamar
\p
\v 1 \add Around that time\add*, Yehudah \add (Judah)\add* went down \add the hills\add* from \add where\add* his brothers \add were\add* and settled near an Adullamite man named Hirah.
\v 2 There Yehudah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua, and he took her \add as a wife\add*. He \add slept with\add* her
\v 3 and she got pregnant and \add in due course\add*, gave birth to a son who Yehudah named Er.
\v 4 Then she got pregnant again and gave birth a \add another\add* son, and she named him Onan.
\v 5 Then she \add got pregnant yet again\add* and gave birth to a \add third\add* son, and she named him Shelah. (\add Yehudah\add* was in Kezib when she \add Onan was born\add*.)
\p
\v 6 \add In due course,\add* Yehudah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.
\v 7 But Er was evil in Yahweh’s eyes, so Yahweh killed him.
\v 8 Then Yehudah said to Onan, “Go to your brother’s wife and perform your \add brotherly\add* duty to her \add to\add* produce \add children\add* for your brother.”
\v 9 However, Onan knew that \add any children\add* wouldn’t be his, so \add whenever\add* he \add slept with\add* his brother’s wife, he spilled \add his semen\add* on the ground so that he wouldn’t give \add children\add* to his \add late\add* brother.
\v 10 \add But\add* Yahweh \add considered\add* what he did to be evil, so he killed him also.
\v 11 Then Judah \add told\add* his daughter-in-law Tamar, “Remain a widow in your father’s house until my son Shelah grows up.” \add This was\add* because he’d said, “So that he doesn’t also die like his brothers!” So Tamar went and lived in the house of her father.
\p
\v 12 \add A long time afterwards\add*, Yehudah’s wife (Shua’s daughter) died. \add After\add* Yehudah \add had finished mourning\add*, he and his friend Hirah (the Adullamite) went to Timnah to \add where\add* the men were shearing his sheep.
\v 13 Then Tamar was told, “Look, your father-in-law is going to Timnah to shear his sheep.”
\v 14 \add So\add* she \add changed out of\add* her widow’s clothes and covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself \add up\add*. Then she sat at the entrance of Enaim which is on the road to Timnah. \add She was doing this\add* because she had seen that Shelah had grown up, but she hadn’t been given to him as a wife.
\p
\v 15 \add In due course,\add* Yehudah saw her and because she had covered her face, he thought she was a prostitute.
\v 16 \add So\add* he turned to her beside the road and asked, “Please let me \add lie with\add* you,” because he didn’t know that she was his daughter-in-law.
\p “What will you give me \add in exchange\add*?” she \add asked\add*.
\p
\v 17 “I’ll send \add you\add* a young goat from my flock,” he replied.
\p “But what about \add something to keep now as\add* a pledge until you send it,” she \add bartered\add*.
\p
\v 18 “What pledge \add should\add* I give you?” he \add asked\add*.
\p “Your signet \add ring\add* and \add its\add* cord, and your staff that \add you’re holding\add*.” \add So\add* he \add handed\add* them to her and went and lay with her, and she became pregnant \add as a result\add*.
\v 19 Then \add Tamar\add* got up and left, and she took off her veil and put her widow’s clothes \add back\add* on.
\p
\v 20 Then Yehudah sent his friend the Adullamite to take the young goat and get the pledge back from the woman, but he couldn’t find her,
\v 21 \add so\add* he asked \add some of the local\add* men, “Where’s the temple prostitute who was at Enaim beside the road?”
\p \add But\add* they answered, “There’s \add never\add* been a temple prostitute \add around here\add*.”
\p
\v 22 \add So Hirah\add* returned to Yehudah and \add told him\add*, “I couldn’t find her. \add What’s more\add*, the men of the place said that there hasn’t been a temple prostitute at that place.”
\p
\v 23 “\add Oh well,\add*” said Yehudah. “Let her \add keep those\add* things for herself so that we don’t become a laughingstock. Anyway, I \add did my duty by sending the goat\add*, but you couldn’t find her.”
\p
\v 24 About three months later, Yehudah was told, “Your daughter-in-law Tamar has prostituted herself, and \add not only that\add*, she’s pregnant from doing it.”
\p “Bring her out and let her be burnt \add to death\add*.” Yehudah \add demanded\add*.
\p
\v 25 \add So they got her and\add* brought her out, \add but\add* she sent a message to her father-in-law, saying, “It was the man who these things belong to that got me pregnant.” Then she \add added\add*, “Please identify whose signet ring and cords and staff these are.”
\p
\v 26 \add When\add* Yehudah recognised \add the items\add*, he admitted, “She’s more \add in the right\add* than I am,\x + \xo 38:26: \xt 37:11.\x* because I didn’t give my son Shelah to her.” \add But\add* he didn’t \add lie with her again\add*.
\p
\v 27 When the time came for \add Tamar\add* to give birth, wow, \add she was going to have twins\add*.
\v 28 \add While\add* she was giving birth, one \add of the babies poked\add* out a hand and the midwife tied a scarlet thread \add around its wrist\add*, saying, “This one came out first.”
\v 29 \add However,\add* it pulled its hand back in, then wow, its brother \add was delivered first\add*. Then she\f + \fr 38:28 \ft It’s not clear from the text who ‘she’ was—either the mother or the midwife. Similarly, the ‘he’ in the next sentence (and in the next verse) is presumably the father.\f* said, “How \add did you manage to\add* break out first?” So he named him ‘Perez’ \add (which means ‘break out’)\add*.
\v 30 After that, his brother who had the scarlet thread on his \add wrist\add* was delivered, and he named him Zerah.

\v 3 His master \add noticed\add* that Yahweh was with him and that Yahweh made everything that he did succeed,
\v 4 \add so\add* Yosef earned his favour as he served him. Then \add Potifar\add* put him in charge of his \add entire\add* household and \add everything that he owned\add*.
\v 5 \add From that time onwards,\add* Yahweh blessed that Egyptian household because of Yosef, and Yahweh’s blessing \add even extended\add* from everything in the home \add all the way out\add* to \add their\add* fields.
\v 6 \add Potifar\add* left all his belonging in Yosef’s charge, \add so much so that\add* he didn’t have to think about anything else beyond \add what he wanted to eat\add*.
\p \add Now\add* Yosef \add had developed\add* into a well-built and handsome \add young man\add*,
\v 7 and after a while, his master’s wife \add started to develop a crush on\add* him and told \add him\add*, “Come to bed with me.”

\p
\v 1 \add Sometime after that\add* the Egyptian king’s cupbearer and baker sinned against their master, \add also known as Far’oh\add*.
\v 2 Far’oh was angry at those two officials
\v 3 and he put them in the custody of the chief of the guards—in the prison where Yosef was \add also being held\add*.
\v 4 \add There\add* the chief of the guards assigned Yosef to serve them.
\p After they’d been in custody for quite some time,
\v 5 the king’s \add cupbearer and baker\add* in prison each had \add separate\add* dreams on the same night, and each man’s dream had its own interpretation.
\v 6 \add The next\add* morning, Yosef came to them, and wow, they were worried,
\v 7 \add so\add* he asked the \add two former\add* officials of Far’oh, “Why are you looking so upset today?”
\p
\v 8 “We each had a dream last night,” they answered, “but there’s no one here who can tell us what our dreams mean.”
\p “God is the only one who gives someone the ability to interpret the meaning of dreams,” Yosef replied. “Please tell me what you dreamed.”
\p
\v 9 Then the chief of the cupbearers \add went first and\add* told his dream to Yosef, “Listen, in my dream there was a grapevine in front of me
\v 10 with three branches on it. Then as soon as the buds appeared \add on the branches\add*, its blossoms came out \add straight away\add* and its clusters ripened into grapes.
\v 11 Then I was holding Far’oh’s cup and I took the grapes and squeezed them into it and I gave the cup to Far’oh.”
\p
\v 12 “This is the interpretation,” Yosef responded. “The three branches \add represent\add* three days.
\v 13 Within three days, Far’oh will \add display you publicly\add* and then restore you to your position. Then you’ll place Far’oh’s cup into his hand, \add just like you used to before\add* when you were his cupbearer.
\v 14 But when it \add all\add* goes well for you, if you remember me then please be kind and mention me to Far’oh \add to\add* get me out of this \add prison\add*,
\v 15 because indeed I was trafficked from the land of the Hebrews. And even here, I didn’t do anything \add to deserve being held in this\add* pit.”
\p
\v 16 \add Now when\add* the chief of the bakers saw that \add this first dream was\add* interpreted \add so\add* favorably, he told Yosef, “I also was in my dream, and listen, there were three baskets of white bread on my head.
\v 17 In the top basket \add there\add* were \add various\add* kinds of food for Far’oh—baker’s goods—but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”
\v 18 “This is the interpretation,” Yosef responded. “The three baskets are three days.
\v 19 Within three days, Far’oh will \add display you publicly\add* and then impale you on a pole, and the birds will eat your flesh \add off your bones\add*.”
\p
\v 20 Then \add three days later\add*, \add it was Far’oh’s birthday\add* and he held a feast for all his officials and he got the chief of the cupbearers and the chief of the bakers \add brought in to stand publicly\add* in the middle of \add everyone\add*.
\v 21 Then he restored the chief of the cupbearers to his position, and \add the man carried\add* the cup \add across to\add* Far’oh,
\v 22 but he had the chief of the bakers executed, just like Yosef had \add described in the interpretation of the dream\add*.

\v 6 \add But\add* wow, seven thin heads of grain sprouted after them—these heads of grain had been scorched by the \add hot, desert\add* wind.
\v 7 Then the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good, fat heads. \add At that point\add*, Pharaoh woke up, and \add realised that\add* it had been a dream.

\v 17 “In my dream,” Far’oh told Yosef, “wow, I was standing on the river bank
\v 18 and then listen, up from the river came seven cows. \add They were\add* well-fed and good-looking, and they grazed among the reeds.
\v 19 Then listen, seven other cows came up after them. \add They were in\add* poor \add condition\add* and very ugly and skinny—I haven’t seen cows that ugly \add anywhere in\add* Egypt.
\v 20 Then the skinny, ugly cows ate the first seven fat cows,
\v 21 \add but\add* you wouldn’t know it because their bellies \add were just as skinny as before\add* and they looked just as ugly as they had before. Then I woke up.
\p
\v 22 “Then I \add had another\add* dream, and listen, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk. \add They were\add* full and good.
\v 23 Then listen, seven \add more\add* heads of grain sprouted after them, \add but they were\add* withered and thin, and scorched by the east wind.
\v 24 Then the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. I told \add these dreams\add* to the sorcerers, but no one could explain \add them\add* to me.”
\p
\v 25 Then Yosef said to Far’oh, “\add The king’s\add* dreams are one \add and the same\add*. God has shown Far’oh what he’s going to do.
\v 26 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good heads of grain are seven years—\add both\add* dreams \add mean the same\add*.
\v 27 And the seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years, and so are the seven thin heads of grain scorched by the east wind. There will be seven years of \add drought\add*.
\v 28 That’s \add why\add* I told Far’oh that God has shown \add him\add* what he’s going to do.
\v 29 Listen, there’s seven years coming of plentiful \add harvests\add* throughout all of Egypt,
\v 30 \add but\add* seven years of \add drought\add* will \add follow\add* after them, \add such that the years of plenty will be quickly\add* forgotten and famine will \add devastate\add* the land.
\v 31 \add Yes,\add* the \add time of plenty\add* won’t be remembered because of the famine \add that follows\add*—it’ll be very \add severe\add*.
\v 32 And as for \add having two dreams with the same meaning\add*, it’s because the matter has been established by God, and God will do it soon.
\p
\v 33 “So now \add the king\add* should find a man who’s discerning and wise, and appoint him over \add all\add* Egypt.
\v 34 Then \add the king\add* should get him to appoint supervisors \add all across the country\add* to collect twenty percent of the \add crops\add* during the seven years of plenty.
\v 35 They should collect that \add surplus\add* food in the coming good years, and store it in the cities \add under the king’s authority\add*. It should be kept
\v 36 and used as a reserve for the seven years of famine that will affect the country, so that the \add people\add* will survive.

\p
\v 37 \add This idea sounded\add* good to Far’oh and to all his servants,
\v 38 so he asked them, “\add Do we have any other\add* man like this who has God’s spirit in him?”
\v 39 Then he told Yosef, “Since God has shown you all this, there’s no one as discerning and wise as you.
\v 40 You’ll be over my household, and all my people will \add obey your every word\add*. Only I on the throne will be greater than you.”\x + \xo 41:40: \xt Acts 7:10.\x*

\v 41 Then \add he added\add*, “See, I’ve put you over all the \add entire country\add*.”
\v 42 Then \add he\add* removed his signet ring from his hand and put it on Yosef’s hand, and he had him dressed in fine linen clothes, and put a gold chain around his neck.\x + \xo 41:42: \xt Dan 5:29.\x*
\v 43 He had \add Yosef\add* ride in his #2 chariot, and they called out in front of him, “Bow down!” So \add the king\add* put him over the entire \add country\add* of Egypt.
\v 44 Far’oh \add also\add* told \add him\add*, “I’m Far’oh, and no person in all Egypt will lift their hand or foot without \add your permission\add*.”
\v 45 Then Far’oh gave him the Egyptian name ‘Zaphenath-Paneah’ \add (which means ‘the one who reveals secrets’)\add*, and he \add presented him with\add* Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, as a wife. And Yosef \add travelled throughout\add* the land of Egypt.
\p
\v 46 Yosef was thirty years old when he’d \add been called to\add* stand before Far’oh king of Egypt. \add When he left\add* Far’oh’s presence, he travelled throughout the land of Egypt
\v 47 and the land produced outstanding harvests during the seven years of plenty.
\v 48 For seven years, he gathered all the food throughout the land of Egypt and had it stored in the cities. The food from the fields that surrounded each city, he put inside \add that city\add*.
\v 49 \add So\add* Yosef stored up so much grain \add that it was\add* like sand \add on the beaches\add*, until he \add eventually\add* stopped measuring it because it \add too much to calculate\add*.
\p
\v 50 Before the years of the famine came, Yosef had two sons that Asenath (the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On) gave birth to.
\v 51 Yosef named the oldest son ‘Manasseh’ \add (which means ‘forget’)\add*, because he said, “God has made me forget all my hardships and all of my family.”
\v 52 His second son he named ‘Ephraim’ \add (which means ‘fruitful’)\add*, because he said, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my difficulties.”
\p
\v 53 Then the seven years of plenty in Egypt came to an end
\v 54 and the seven years of famine started, just as Yosef had said. The famine \add covered the entire wider region\add*, but \add it was different in\add* Egypt.\x + \xo 41:54: \xt Acts 7:11.\x*
\v 55 All the land of Egypt became famished, and the people cried to \add the king\add* for food, so Far’oh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Yosef \add and\add* do whatever he tells you.”\x + \xo 41:55: \xt Jn 2:5.\x*
\v 56 The famine was \add right across the country\add*, so Yosef opened all the grain stores and sold grain to the Egyptians. \add But\add* the famine in Egypt was \add really\add* severe.
\v 57 Then \add people from much further away started\add* coming to Egypt to buy grain from Yosef, because the famine was severe in the \add entire wider region\add*.
\c 42
\s1 Yosef’s brothers turn up in Egypt
\rem /s1 Joseph’s Brothers Go to Egypt to Buy Grain; Joseph’s Brothers Go to Egypt
\p
\v 1 \add Meanwhile (up in the Canaan region),\add* Yacob \add heard\add* that there was grain \add available\add* in Egypt, so \add he\add* said to his sons, “Why are you \add just standing there\add* looking at each other?
\v 2 Listen, I’ve heard that \add they’re selling\add* grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy some for us so that we \add won’t just starve to death here\add*.”\x + \xo 42:2: \xt Acts 7:12.\x*
\v 3 \add So\add* ten of Yosef’s brothers \add travelled\add* down to Egypt to buy grain,
\v 4 \add but\add* Yacob wouldn’t send Benyamin (Yosef’s \add youngest\add* brother) with \add the others\add*, because he said, “I don’t want any harm to come to him.”
\p
\v 5 \add So\add* Yisra’el’s sons \add found themselves\add* among \add many others\add* who \add went\add* to buy grain, because the famine was \add also throughout\add* the Canaan \add region\add*.
\v 6 \add Now\add* Yosef was the governor over \add all of Egypt\add* and he \add was the one there\add* who was selling grain to all the people. So Yosef’s brothers \add approached\add* and bowed down to him with their noses to the ground.
\v 7 \add When\add* Yosef saw his brothers, he recognized them and acted like a stranger to them, and he spoke harshly with them \add (through an interpreter)\add*, “Where \add are you lot from\add*?”
\p “From the land of Canaan to buy food,” they \add answered\add*.
\p
\v 8 Yosef had recognised his brothers, but they hadn’t recognised him,
\v 9 and \add just then\add* he remembered the dreams that he had dreamed about them, \add so\add* he said to them, “You are spies. You’ve \add all\add* come to \add discover any weak points in this country’s defences\add*.”\x + \xo 42:9: \xt Gen 37:5-10.\x*
\p
\v 10 “No, my master,” they \add answered\add*. “Your servants have \add only\add* come to buy food.
\v 11 We’re \add all\add* sons of \add the same\add* man. We’re \add being\add* honest. Your servants are not spies.”
\p
\v 12 “No, you’ve definitely \add all\add* come \add here\add* to see \add where our land is vulnerable\add*,” \add Yosef insisted\add*.
\p
\v 13 “Your servants are twelve brothers,” they protested. “We’re \add all\add* sons of one man in the Canaan \add region\add*. \add It’s all true\add*—the youngest is \add home\add* with our father, and one \add has passed away\add*.”
\p
\v 14 “\add Yes,\add* it’s just as I said,” retorted Yosef. “You’re spies!
\v 15 \add But\add* this is how we’ll test you all: On Far’oh’s life, you won’t \add ever\add* leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here.
\v 16 \add Select\add* one among you to go and get your brother, and \add the rest of\add* you will be \add imprisoned\add*. Then \add we’ll find out if you’ve all been telling the truth\add*. And if not, on Far’oh’s life, you’re certainly spies.”
\v 17 Then he had them \add locked up\add* together for three days.
\p
\v 18 On the third day, Yosef told them, “I’m a man who reveres God. So if you do \add exactly\add* what I say, I’ll let you live.
\v 19 If you are \add actually\add* honest, leave one of your brothers \add in prison here\add*, and you \add others\add* go and take grain back \add to feed\add* your families.
\v 20 Then \add when\add* you will bring me your youngest brother so that \add I can verify your statements\add*, then you won’t die.” So they \add agreed\add*,
\v 21 saying to each other \add (in Hebrew)\add*, “We are truly guilty concerning our brother \add Yosef\add*, because we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, but we didn’t \add take any notice\add*. \add That’s why\add* this \add predicament has happened to\add* us.”
\p
\v 22 “Didn’t I \add beg\add* you \add all\add* not to sin against the lad?” Reuben spoke up. “But you wouldn’t listen, so now, see, \add now we’re having to account for\add* his blood.”\x + \xo 42:22: \xt Gen 37:21-22.\x*
\v 23 (\add But\add* they didn’t know that Yosef understood them, because \add he and them had been speaking through an interpreter\add*.)
\v 24 \add Yosef\add* turned away from them \add briefly so they couldn’t see his tears\add*, then he turned back toward them and spoke to them. Then he had Simeon \add separated\add* from \add the group\add* and tied up in front of them.
\v 25 Then Yosef ordered \add his servants\add* and they filled their bags with grain, and he \add quietly\add* ordered them to return each man’s silver \add back\add* to his sack and to give them provisions to them for the road.
\s1 Yosef’s brothers return home
\rem /s1 Joseph’s Brothers Return to Canaan
\p \add After Yosef had provided for his brothers\add*,
\v 26 they loaded their grain onto their donkeys and departed.
\v 27 At a lodging place \add that night\add*, one \add of them\add* opened his sack to feed his donkey and \add to his horror\add*, he saw his silver inside the top of the sack.
\v 28 “My silver’s been returned,” he told his brothers, “and it’s \add right here\add* in my sack!”
\p
\v 29 \add When\add* they \add got home\add* to Yacob their father in Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them,
\v 30 “\add This\add* man, the master of \add Eygpt\add*, spoke harshly to us and treated us as if we were spying out \add his country\add*,
\v 31 but we told him, ‘We’re honest—we’re not spies.
\v 32 We’re twelve brothers, the sons of our father. One is \add no longer\add* alive, and the youngest is with our father today \add back\add* in Canaan.’
\v 33 Then \add that\add* man told us, ‘\add I’ll find out if you’re honest\add*: Leave one of your brothers with me, and take grain for your families and go.
\v 34 Then bring me your youngest brother so that I’ll know you’re not spies—that you’re \add telling the truth\add*. Then I’ll \add release\add* your brother and you can trade \add here freely\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 35 Then \add when\add* they \add started\add* emptying their sacks, wow, each man’s pouch of silver was inside his sack. \add When the brothers\add* and their father saw their pouches of silver, they were afraid.
\v 36 “You’ve \add deprived\add* me \add of another son\add*,” Yacob \add exclaimed\add*. Yosef is \add gone\add*! Simeon’s \add gone\add*! And \add then you want to take\add* Benyamin \add as well\add*! \add Why’s everything going so wrong for\add* me?”
\v 37 Then Reuben \add offered\add* to his father, “You can kill my two sons if I don’t bring \add Benyamin back\add* to you. \add Let me take responsibility for him\add*, and I’ll \add make sure that he\add* returns to you.”
\v 38 “My son will \em not\em* go with you,” Yacob countered, “because his brother is dead, and he alone is left. And if harm were to meet him on the road that you’re going on, then you’d bring my gray head down to the grave in grief.”

\p
\v 1 \add However,\add* the famine in the region was \add still\add* very severe,
\v 2 \add so\add* when they’d \add used up all\add* the grain that they’d brought from Egypt, their father \add instructed\add* them, “Go back \add there and\add* buy \add some\add* food for us.”
\p
\v 3 \add But\add* Yehudah \add challenged\add* him, “\add That\add* man \add told us that he won’t even see us\add* unless \add our\add* brother is with \add us\add*.
\v 4 We can \add only\add* go \add there\add* to buy food for you if you’ll \add agree to\add* send our \add youngest\add* brother with us.
\v 5 If you don’t, \add it’s not even worth going, because that\add* man \add clearly told us that he won’t even see us\add* unless \add our\add* brother is with \add us\add*.
\p
\v 6 “Why did you all treat me badly by telling the man you have \add a younger\add* brother?” \add their father\add* Yisra’el asked.
\p
\v 7 “The man \add kept asking\add* about us and our relatives,” they answered. “\add He asked\add*, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?’ \add We just answered what he asked\add*. How could we possibly know that he would \add insist that we bring our youngest brother there\add*?”
\p
\v 8 Then Yehudah said to his father, “\add Entrust\add* the young man to me, and we’ll \add pack\add* up and go so that both we and you and our little ones will live and not die.
\v 9 I myself will guarantee him. \add If anything happens to him, you can charge it to me\add*. If I don’t \add get\add* him \add safely\add* back to you, then I’ll \add personally\add* carry the blame \add for the rest of my life\add*.
\v 10 \add If we hadn’t sat around here doing nothing for so long\add*, certainly by now we could have \add been there and back\add* twice!”
\p
\v 11 “\add Well, if that’s our only choice\add*,” their father \add acceded\add*, “then do this: Take some of the best produce \add from around here\add* in your bags, and take it down to the man as a gift: a little balm, a little honey, spices and myrrh, \add and some\add* pistachio nuts and almonds.
\v 12 And take double the \add amount of\add* silver, because you must repay the silver that was returned in the \add tops\add* of your sacks. Perhaps it was a mistake.
\v 13 So take your brother and \add go and\add* return to the man.
\v 14 May the provider God Almighty \add cause\add* the man to treat you kindly, and may he send your other brother and Benyamin \add back\add* with you. And \add as for me\add*, if I \add lose another son\add*, I’ll \add just have to mourn him\add*.”
\p
\v 15 \add So\add* the \add brothers\add* took the gifts and double the \add amount of\add* silver. Then \add taking\add* Benyamin, they \add travelled\add* down to Egypt and \add presented themselves\add* to Yosef.
\v 16 \add When\add* Yosef saw Benyamin with them, he told \add his head house-servant\add*, “Take \add these\add* men to the house, and slaughter an animal and prepare a meal, because \add they’ll\add* eat with me at noon.”
\v 17 The man did what \add he’d\add* been instructed and brought the men to Yosef’s house.
\p
\v 18 \add But\add* the \add brothers\add* were afraid when they \add found out that they’d been\add* brought to \add wait outside\add* Yosef’s house, and said \add to each other\add*, “We must have been brought \add here\add* because of the silver that was returned in our sacks the first time. \add He wants to overpower us, then arrest\add* us and \add confiscate\add* our donkeys and take us as slaves.”
\rem /s1 A Feast at Joseph’s Palace
\v 19 \add So\add* they approached the \add head servant\add* and spoke to him at the entrance of the house,
\v 20 \add explaining\add*, “Please, my master, honestly, we came down here the first time to buy food.
\v 21 \add But\add* when we \add got\add* to \add our\add* lodging place \add that evening\add*, we opened our sacks and \add got a shock because\add* each man’s silver was in the \add top\add* of his sack—the full amount of our silver was there. So we’ve brought it back \add here on this trip\add*,
\v 22 plus we’ve brought more silver to buy food. We don’t know who put \add that\add* silver in our sacks.”
\v 23 \add But\add* he said, “Peace to you—don’t be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you hidden treasure in your sacks—\add I received your previous payment\add*.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.
\p
\v 24 Then the \add servant\add* took the \add brothers\add* into Yosef’s house. He \add had\add* water \add given to them\add* and they washed their feet, and he \add had\add* fodder \add given\add* to their donkeys.
\v 25 Then they \add got theirs gifts ready\add* for when Yosef would arrive at midday, because they’d heard that they would \add be given lunch\add* there.
\v 26 \add When\add* Yosef \add arrived there\add*, they brought \add their gifts\add* and they bowed to the ground \add in front of him\add*.
\v 27 Then he asked them about their \add living situation at home\add* and \add questioned\add*, “Is everything ok for your elderly father that you \add told me\add* about? Is he still alive?”
\p
\v 28 “Things are well for your servant our father. \add And yes,\add* he’s still alive.” Then they bowed their heads and bowed \add to the ground again\add*.
\p
\v 29 Then \add Yosef looked around\add* and saw his full-brother Benyamin, and asked, “Is this your youngest brother that you spoke to me about?” Then he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.”
\v 30 \add At that point, Yosef had to\add* hurry out \add of the room\add*, because \add he was so overcome with emotion for his younger\add* brother that he needed to cry, \add so\add* he went to \add his\add* inner room and cried there.
\v 31 Then he washed his face and came out, controlling himself and \add ordering\add*, “Serve the meal.”
\v 32 \add So the servants\add* served \add Yosef at his own table\add*, and served \add the brothers separately\add* and the Egyptians who were eating with him \add separately again\add* (because Egyptians won’t eat \add together\add* with Hebrews, because Egyptians \add would find that demeaning\add*.
\v 33 \add At their table, the brothers were astonished to discover\add* that they had been seated in order from the oldest to the youngest.
\v 34 Then they were served food \add Yosef’s table\add*, but Benyamin’s serving was five times larger than any of \add the others\add*, and they drank and they and \add Yosef all\add* got a bit tiddly.
\c 44
\s1 Yosef frames Benyamin for theft

\p
\v 1 Then \add Yosef commanded his head servant\add*, “Fill the men’s sacks with grain, as much as they are able to carry, and put each man’s \add payment back into the top\add* of his sack.
\v 2 And put my \add own\add* silver cup in the \add top\add* of the youngest one’s sack \add along with his payment\add*.” So he did \add what he was instructed\add*.
\v 3 The \add next\add* morning at daylight, the \add brothers\add* and their donkeys were sent off \add to start their trip home\add*.
\v 4 They hadn’t gone very far out of the city \add when\add* Yosef \add told his head servant\add*, “Get up and, follow after \add those\add* men. When you overtake them, \add ask\add* them, ‘Why did you repay good with evil?
\v 5 Isn’t this \add the cup that\add* my master drinks from and indeed, what he divines with? You’ve done evil \add taking that\add*.’ ”
\p
\v 6 \add So the servant\add* overtook them and \add did exactly what he’d been instructed to do\add*.
\v 7 But they \add asked\add* him, “Why does my master \add say that\add*? Far be it from your servants to do something like that.
\v 8 \add Listen\add*, we brought the silver that we found in the \add top\add* of our sacks back to you from the land of Canaan. So \add why\add* would we \add then\add* steal silver or gold from the house of your master?
\v 9 If you find \add anything stolen with any of us\add*, \add that person can be executed\add*, and \add the rest of us can also be taken as\add* slaves for my master.”
\p
\v 10 “Indeed,” the \add servant replied\add*, “according to your words, \add that’s how\add* it’ll be: whoever is found with \add the stolen cup\add* will become my slave, \add but\add* you others will be \add free to go\add*.”
\v 11 So each \add of the brothers\add* quickly lowered his sack to the ground, and each one opened his sack.
\v 12 Then \add Yosef’s servant\add* searched beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benyamin’s sack.
\v 13 \add Seeing this, the brothers\add* tore their clothes \add (as a sign of their distress)\add*, and each one loaded up his donkey, and they \add all\add* returned to the city.
\p
\v 14 \add When\add* Yehudah and his brothers \add got\add* to Yosef’s house, he was still there, and they fell \add to their knees and bowed\add* to the ground in front of him.
\v 15 “What’s this that you’ve done?” Yosef \add demanded\add*. “Didn’t you know that a man like me can certainly divine \add the truth\add*?”
\p
\v 16 “What can we say to my master?” Yehuda \add answered\add*. “What \add words\add* could we speak? How could we \add possibly\add* justify ourselves? God has exposed the sin of your servants. \add So now\add*, we are slaves for my master—both we and the one who was found with the cup.”
\p
\v 17 “Far be it from me to do that.” Yosef \add corrected them\add*. “\add Only\add* the man who had the cup will become my slave, and \add the rest of\add* you can go \add back\add* to your father in peace.”

\p
\v 18 Then Yehuda went closer to \add Yosef\add* and said \add quietly\add*, “Please, my master, please let your servant speak a word in my master’s ears, and don’t \add get angry with me\add*, since you’re \add as powerful as\add* Far’oh.
\v 19 My master \add previously\add* asked his servants \add if we had\add* a father or another brother?
\v 20 And we answered to my master, ‘\add Yes,\add* we have an elderly father and \add also\add* the youngest son of his old age. But \add that son’s\add* brother is dead, so he \add alone is left of his mother’s children\add*, and his father loves him.’
\v 21 Then you told your servants, ‘Bring \add the other son here so I can see\add* him \add myself\add*.’
\v 22 And we said to my master, ‘The young man isn’t able to leave his father, because if he \add does\add*, then \add the old man\add* will die.’
\v 23 But \add then\add* you said to your servants, ‘If your youngest brother doesn’t come with you, you won’t \add get access to me\add* again.’
\p
\v 24 “\add After all that,\add* when we went \add back\add* to your servant my father, we explained your words to him, my master.
\v 25 \add Eventually,\add* our father \add told us\add*, ‘Return \add there to\add* buy \add some\add* food for us.’
\v 26 But we \add told him\add*, ‘We can’t go \add back unless\add* our youngest brother is with us, because we wouldn’t be able to \add get access to that\add* man if our youngest brother wasn’t with us.’
\v 27 Then your servant my father told us, ‘You know that my wife gave birth to two sons for me.
\v 28 \add One of them\add* went away from me, and I’ve \add assumed that\add* he was torn to pieces, and I’ve never seen him \add again\add*.
\v 29 So if you also take this \add son away\add* and \add something happened to\add* him, then you’d bring my gray head down to \add the grave\add* in misery.’
\p
\v 30 “\add So\add* now, \add if I was to return home\add* to your servant my father \add without that\add* young man, since his \add father’s\add* soul is bound to his soul,
\v 31 then \add as soon as\add* he sees that the young man isn’t \add will us\add*, then he’ll \add have a heart attack\add* and \add so\add* your servants will bring the gray head of your servant our father down to \add the grave\add* in misery.

\v 6 There’s \add already\add* been two years of famine in this region, \add but\add* there’s still five more years to come without any ploughing or harvesting.

\v 8 \add You see\add*, it wasn’t you who sent me here, but God. And he’s made me \add like a\add* father to Far’oh, and master over all his house and the ruler in all the land of Egypt.

\v 28 \add As they all approached Egypt, Yacob\add* sent Yehuda ahead \add of the others\add* to find out from Yosef how to get to Goshen. \add As they all\add* arrived in the Goshen area,

\v 30 “Now I can die,” Yisra’el said to Yosef, “since I’ve seen your face—\add seen\add* that you’re still alive.”
\p
\v 31 Then Yosef spoke to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I’ll go and report to Far’oh and \add explain\add* to him that my brothers and my father’s household who were living in Canaan have come to \add join\add* me.
\v 32 \add I’ll tell him that you’re\add* herders of sheep—livestock \add farmers\add*—and \add that you’ve\add* brought your flocks and herds and everything that \add you own\add*.
\v 33 So when Far’oh calls for you and \add asks what your work is\add*,
\v 34 then you should \add answer\add*, ‘Your servants have been livestock men from our youth and until now, both we and also our fathers,’ so that you can settle \add here\add* in Goshen, because Egyptians \add despise sheep herders\add*.”
\c 47
\rem /s1 Jacob Blesses Pharaoh
\p
\v 1 Then went Yosef to Far’oh and told \add him\add*, “My father and brothers and their flocks and herds and everything that \add belongs\add* to them, have come from Canaan and they’re \add here now\add* Goshen \add area\add*.”
\v 2 Then he took five of his brothers and presented them to Far’oh,
\v 3 and Far’oh \add asked them\add*, “What’s your occupation?”
\p “Your servants have been shepherds \add for several generations\add*,” they \add replied\add*.
\v 4 Then they \add explained\add*, “We’ve come to \add stay here for a while\add* because in Canaan, there’s no pasture for our flocks because \add the drought is very severe\add*. So now, please let your servants settle in the Goshen \add area\add*.”
\v 5 Then Far’oh turned to Yosef, “Your father and your brothers have come to you.
\v 6 The \add entire country\add* of Egypt is in front of you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best land, \add so\add* let them settle in the Goshen \add area\add*. And if you’re \add aware\add* that \add some of them have special talents\add*, then appoint them as overseers of \add my own\add* livestock \add as well\add*.”
\p
\v 7 Then Yosef brought his father Yacob and presented him to Far’oh, and Yacob blessed Far’oh.
\v 8 “How \add old are you\add*?” Far’oh asked him.
\p
\v 9 “\add I’ve been moving from place to place for\add* 130 years,” Yacob \add replied\add*. “\add My life has been short and with many difficulties, so I\add* haven’t reached the longer \add ages of my ancestors in their moving around\add*.”
\v 10 Then \add he\add* blessed Far’oh \add again\add* and departed from \add his\add* presence.
\v 11 So Yosef gave his father and his brothers \add some of the best land\add* in Egypt and \add helped\add* them settle there—in the Rameses \add district just\add* as Far’oh had commanded.
\v 12 \add He also\add* provided his father and his brothers and all his father’s household with bread—each family according to the \add number of children\add*.

\p
\v 13 \add Then the time came when\add* there was no bread in \add that entire part of\add* the world, because the f\add drought\add* was now extremely severe, and \add both\add* Egypt and Canaan were \add suffering with food shortages\add*.
\v 14 \add People all over came\add* to buy grain, and \add over time\add* Yosef had received \add in payment\add* all the silver that could be found in Egypt and Canaan, and \add he in turn\add* took it to Far’oh’s house.
\v 15 So \add once there was no more silver left\add* in Egypt and in Canaan, all \add the Egyptians\add* demanded from Yosef, “Give us food. Why should we die \add right here in front of\add* you? \add All our money\add* is gone!”
\p
\v 16 “Bring your livestock,” Yosef \add answered\add*, “and I’ll give grain to you in exchange for \add them\add*, since the silver is gone.”
\v 17 So \add the people\add* brought their livestock to \add him\add*, and \add he\add* gave them grain \add in exchange for their\add* horses and sheep and cattle and donkeys. So he provided them with food that year \add in exchange\add* for all their livestock.
\p
\v 18 \add The next\add* year they came to \add Yosef\add* and \add begged\add*, “We can’t hide it from our master that since \add there’s no silver left\add* and \add since all \add* the livestock \add now\add* belongs to our lord, there’s nothing left \add to offer other than\add* our bodies and our lands.
\v 19 Why should we die \add right in front of you\add*—both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will be slaves to Far’oh. And give us seed so that we’ll live and not die, and so that the land won’t be barren.”
\p
\v 20 So Yosef bought all the farmland of Egypt for Far’oh, because every Egyptian sold his field. \add In that way, all\add* the land became Far’oh’s because the famine was \add so extreme\add*.
\v 21 \add As for\add* the people, he moved them to the cities\f + \fr 47:21 \ft TC: There’s a variation here in different early copies and translations. Rather than moving the people into the cities (which might have been done to make food distribution more efficient), some translations choose the alternative ‘made the people slaves’.\f* from one end of Egypt to the other.
\v 22 The only land he didn’t buy was that of the priests, because they \add were given a regular allowance\add* by Far’oh. Because they \add could live on what they were supplied with\add*, they didn’t \add need to\add* sell their land.
\v 23 Then Yosef told the people, “Listen, now that I’ve bought you and your land for Far’oh, here is seed for you so that you can \add work\add* the ground.
\v 24 \add Every time\add* you harvest \add a crop\add*, you must give a fifth \add of it\add* to Far’oh. The \add other\add* four parts will be for you \add to use\add* as seed and as food for yourselves and your households and your young children.”
\p
\v 25 “You’ve kept us alive,” they \add agreed\add*. “Master, \add continue to show us your favour\add*, and we’ll be slaves for Far’oh.”
\v 26 So Yosef established it as a law to this day concerning the Egyptian farmland: that the fifth belongs to Far’oh. (Only the priests’ land didn’t become Far’oh’s.)

\v 1 Some time after that, Yosef was told, “Listen, your father is sick.” So Yosef \add went to him\add*, taking his two sons with him—Manasseh and Efraim.

\v 9 “They are my sons that God has given me \add here\add* in this place.” Yosef \add replied\add* to his father.
\p “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them,” \add Yacob requested\add*.
\v 10 Now Yisra’el’s sight was poor in his old age, so he wasn’t able to see \add much\add*. So \add Yosef\add* brought them over to him, and \add Yisra’el\add* kissed them and embraced them.
\v 11 “I \add never expected to see you again\add*” \add he\add* said to Yosef, “but wow, God has \add even\add* let me see your children as well.”
\v 12 Then Yosef removed \add his sons\add* from his \add father’s\add* knees and bowed with his face to the ground.
\p
\v 13 Then Yosef took both of them—Efraim on his right toward Yisra’el’s left and Manasseh \add (the eldest)\add* on his left toward Yisra’el’s right—and brought them close to him.
\v 14 But Yisra’el intentionally extended his right hand and placed it on the Efraim’s head (the younger one), and \add crossing his arms,\add* he placed his left hand on Manasseh’s head.
\v 15 Then he blessed Yosef saying,
\q1 “May the God who my \add grandfather\add* Abraham and my father Yitshak \add served\add*,

\v 17 Then Yosef noticed that his father had placed his right hand on Efraim’s head and he was upset about it, so he picked up his father’s hand to move it across to Manasseh’s head,

\v 29 Then Yacob instructed them, “I’m about to go and join my ancestors. Bury me with them in the cave in the field \add that was bought from\add* Efron the Hittite,
\v 30 in the cave that is in Machpelah’s field in front of Mamre in Canaan. That’s \add the cave that my grandfather\add* Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite as property for a burial place.\x + \xo 49:30: \xt Gen 23:3-20.\x*
\v 31 Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried there, along with \add their son\add* Isaac and his wife Rebekah, and I \add also\add* buried \add my wife\add* Le’ah there.\x + \xo 49:31: a \xt Gen 25:9-10; \xo b \xt Gen 35:29.\x*
\v 32 That field and the cave in it was bought from the descendants of Het.
\v 33 \add When\add* Yacob finished giving those instructions to his sons, he pulled his feet up into the bed \add and lay\add* and breathed his last and \add his spirit joined his ancestors\add*.\x + \xo 49:33: \xt Acts 7:15.\x*

\p
\v 1 Then Yosef \add hugged\add* his father and cried over him and kissed him.
\v 2 Then \add he\add* commanded \add those of\add* his servants \add who were\add* physicians to embalm his father. \add So\add* Yisra’el’s \add body\add* was embalmed
\v 3 over the next forty days (which is the normal time for embalming), and the Egyptians mourned for him for seventy days.
\p
\v 4 After those mourning days were over, Yosef spoke to Far’oh’s \add servants\add*, saying, “Please, if I have found favor in your eyes, please tell Far’oh that
\v 5 my father made me swear, saying, ‘Listen, I am dying. You must bury me in my grave that I dug for myself in Canaan.’ So now, please \add ask Far’oh to\add* let me go up there and bury my father, then I’ll return.”\x + \xo 50:5: \xt Gen 47:29-31.\x*
\p
\v 6 “Go up and bury your father just like he made you promise.” was the reply back from Far’oh.
\p
\v 7 So Yosef went up \add to Canaan\add* to bury his father. Far’oh’s servants went with him, along with the elders from Far’oh’s household and all the elders of the land of Egypt.
\v 8 Yosef’s own household also went, along with his brothers and his father’s household. They only left their children and their livestock behind in Goshen.
\v 9 There were chariots as well as \add soliders\add* mounted on horses so it was a very large procession.
\p
\v 10 After they crossed the Jordan river, they arrived at Atad’s threshing floor, and they mourned there for seven days with very loud wailing.
\v 11 The local Canaanite people saw the mourning at Atad’s threshing floor, and they said, “This is \add very serious\add* mourning for the Egyptians.” That’s why they then named that place across the Jordan ‘Abel Mizraim’ \add (which means ‘the Egyptians mourned here’)\add*.
\p
\v 12 \add So\add* Yacob’s sons did everything just how he’d instructed them.
\v 13 \add They\add* carried \add his embalmed body\add* to Canaan and buried him in the cave in Machpelah’s field. Abraham had bought with the field with the included cave from Ephron the Hittite as property for a burial place, in front of Mamre.\x + \xo 50:13: \xt Acts 7:16.\x*

\v 14 Then after his father’s burial was completed, Yosef returned to Egypt along with his brothers and everyone who had gone up with him to bury \add him\add*.

\p
\v 15 \add Now that their father was no longer alive\add*, Yosef’s brothers said \add to each other\add*, “What if Yosef hates us \add and now he decides to\add* repay us for all the evil \add things\add* that we did to him?”
\v 16 So they sent a messenger to Yosef to tell him, “Before he died, your father ordered that
\v 17 you be given this message: ‘I beg you, please forgive your brothers’ crime and their sin, because they did evil \add things\add* to you.’ So now, please forgive the crime of the servants of your father’s God.” When Yosef heard their message, he \add started\add* crying.
\p
\v 18 Then his brothers also came and \add bowed to the ground in front of\add* him and \add pleaded\add*, “Here we are. We belong to you as slaves.”
\p
\v 19 “Don’t be afraid,” Yosef answered. “\add I’m not God and it’s not my job to decide on your punishment\add*.
\v 20 You all plotted evil things against me, but God intended it for good in order to do what he’s doing this \add very\add* day: to save many people.
\v 21 So now, don’t be afraid. I’ll support you and your little ones.” So he reassured them and he spoke \add kindly to them\add*.

\v 22 Yosef continued to live in Egypt, along with \add the rest of\add* his father Yacob’s family, until he was 110 years old.
\v 23 He lived long enough to see his son Ephraim’s children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. The children of his grandson Machir, who was Manasseh’s son, also grew up around him.
\v 24 Then \add one day\add* Yosef said to his brothers, “I’m about to die, but God will definitely help you all and take you \add and your descendants\add* from this country to the land that he vowed to give to Abraham, Yitshak, and Yacob.
\v 25 When God does that, you must take my body \add back to Canaan with you and bury it there\add*.” Then Yosef had \add his brothers and the rest of the descendants of Yisra’el\add* vow \add that they would do that\add*.\x + \xo 50:25: \xt Exo 13:19; Josh 24:32; Heb 11:22.\x*
\v 26 Then Yosef died at the age of 110, and \add the specialists\add* embalmed \add his body\add* and it was put in a coffin in \add a tomb in\add* Egypt.
