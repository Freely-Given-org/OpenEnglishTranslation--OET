\v 14 The \add one\add* sowing is_sowing the message.
\v 15 And these are the \add ones\add* along the road where the message is_being_sown, and whenever they_may_hear, the Satan/(Sāţān) immediately is_coming and is_carrying the message which having_been_sown in them.
\v 16 And these are likewise the \add ones\add* being_sown on the rocky \add places\add*, who whenever they_may_hear the message, are_receiving it immediately with joy,

\v 21 And he_was_saying to_them: Surely_not the lamp is_coming, in_order_that it_may_be_put under the basket or under the bed? Not in_order_that it_may_be_put on the lampstand?
\v 22 For/Because there_is not hidden, if not in_order_that it_may_be_revealed, and_not it_became \add a\add*_secret, but in_order_that it_may_come to manifest.
\v 23 If anyone is_having ears to_be_hearing, let_him_be_hearing.

\v 29 But whenever it_may_give_over the fruit, immediately he_is_sending_out the sickle because the harvest has_presented.
\v 30 And he_was_saying: How may_we_liken the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*, or with what parable may_we_present it?
\v 31 As to_\add a\add*_seed of_mustard, which whenever it_may_be_sown on the earth, being smaller \add than\add* all the seeds which on the earth,

\v 7 and having_cried_out with_\add a\add*_ loud _voice he_is_saying: What to_me and to_you \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, son of_ The the highest _\nd god\nd*? I_am_imploring you the by_\nd god\nd*, you_may_ not _torment me.
\v 8 For/Because he_was_saying to_him: Come_out out_of the man the the unclean spirit. 
\v 9 And he_was_asking him: What \add is\add* \add the\add*_name of_you? And he_is_saying to_him: Many_thousands \add is\add* \add the\add*_name to_me, because we_are many.
\v 10 And he_was_imploring him much that he_may_ not _send_out them out the country.
\v 11 And there was \add a\add*_ great _herd of_pigs being_fed near the mountain, 
\v 12 and they_implored him saying: Send us into the pigs, in_order_that we_may_come_in into them.
\v 13 And he_permitted to_them. And the the unclean spirits having_come_out, came_in into the pigs, and the herd about two_thousand rushed down the steep_bank into the sea and they_were_being_drowned in the sea.
\v 14 And the \add ones\add* feeding them fled, and they_reported to the city and to the country. And came_out to_see what is the \add thing\add* having_become.
\v 15 And they_are_coming to the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, and they_are_observing the \add man\add* being_demon_possessed sitting, having_been_clothed and being_sensible, the \add one\add* having_had the Many_thousands, and they_were_afraid.
\v 16 And the \add ones\add* having_seen \add it\add* described to_them, how it_became to_the \add one\add* being_demon_possessed, and concerning the pigs.
\v 17 And they_began to_be_imploring him to_go_away from the regions of_them.
\v 18 And him boarding into the boat, the \add one\add* having_been_demon_possessed was_begging him that he_may_be with him.

\v 20 And he_went_away and began to_be_proclaiming in the Dekapolis as_much_as the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* did for_him, and all were_marvelling.
\v 21 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_crossed_over in the boat again to the \add side\add* across, \add a\add*_ great _crowd was_gathered_together to him, and he_was beside the sea.
\v 22 And see, one of_the synagogue_leaders by_\add the\add*_name Yaeiros is_coming, and having_seen him, is_falling at the feet of_him,
\v 23 and he_is_imploring him much saying, that The little_daughter of_me is_holding to_the_end, in_order_that having_come, you_may_lay_on the hands on_her, in_order_that she_may_be_healed and may_live.
\v 24 And he_went_away with him. And \add a\add*_ great _crowd was_following after_him, and they_were_pressing_on him.
\v 25 And \add a\add*_woman being twelve years with \add a\add*_hemorrhage of_blood,

\v 27 having_heard the \add things\add* concerning the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, having_come behind in the crowd, she_touched against_the garment of_him.
\v 28 For/Because she_was_saying that If I_may_touch even_if against_the garments of_him, I_will_be_being_healed.
\v 29 And immediately the flow of_the blood of_her was_dried_up, and she_knew in_her body that she_has_been_healed from the affliction.
\v 30 And immediately the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, having_known in himself the power having_come_out out_of him, having_been_turned_back in the crowd he_was_saying: Who touched against_the clothes of_me?
\v 31 And the apprentices/followers of_him were_saying to_him: You_are_seeing the crowd pressing_on you, and you_are_saying: Who touched against_me?
\v 32 And he_was_looking_around to_see the \add woman\add* having_done this.
\v 33 And the woman having_been_afraid and trembling, having_known what has_become to_her, came and fell_before before_him and told all the truth to_him.
\v 34 And he said to_her: Daughter, the faith of_you has_healed you, be_going in peace, and be healthy from the affliction of_you.
\v 35 Still of_him speaking, they_are_coming from the synagogue_leader saying, that The daughter of_you died_off, why you_are_ still _troubling the teacher?
\v 36 But the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_overheard the message being_spoken is_saying to_the \add the\add*_synagogue_leader: Be_ not _fearing, only be_believing.
\v 37 And he_ not _allowed no_one with him to_accompany, except not/lest the Petros, and Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), and Yōannaʸs the brother of_Yakōbos.
\v 38 And they_are_coming to the house of_the \add the\add*_synagogue_leader, and he_is_observing \add a\add*_commotion and weeping and much screaming.
\v 39 And having_come_in, he_is_saying to_them: Why are_you_all_being_distressed and are_you_all_weeping? The little_child not died_off, but is_sleeping.
\v 40 And they_were_ridiculing of_him. But he having_throw_ all _out, is_taking the father of_the little_child and the mother and the \add ones\add* with him, and he_is_entering_in where the little_child was.
\v 41 And having_taken_hold of_the hand of_the little_child, he_is_saying to_her: Talitha, koum. Which is being_translated - Little_girl, I_am_saying to_you, be_raising. 
\v 42 And immediately the little_girl rose_up and she_was_walking, because/for she_was twelve of_years. And they_marvelled immediately with_ great _amazement.

\v 16 But having_heard, the Haʸrōdaʸs was_saying, that Yōannaʸs whom I beheaded, this was_raised. 
\v 17 For/Because the Haʸrōdaʸs himself, having_sent_out, apprehended the Yōannaʸs and bound him in prison because_of Haʸrōidias, the wife of_Filippos, the brother of_him, because he_married her.
\v 18 For/Because the Yōannaʸs was_saying to_ the _Haʸrōdaʸs, that It_is_ not _permitting for_you to_be_having the wife of_the brother of_you.
\v 19 And the Haʸrōidias was_resenting him, and was_wanting to_kill_ him _off, and he_was_ not _able,

\v 43 And they_took_up fragments of_twelve baskets fillings, and of the fishes.
\v 44 And the \add ones\add* having_eaten the loaves were five_thousand men.

\v 51 And he_went_up to them into the boat, and the wind died_down. And they_were_marvelling exceedingly in themselves,

\v 53 And having_crossed_over to the land, they_came to Gennaʸsaret and were_anchored.

\v 1 And the Farisaios_\add party\add* and some of_the scribes, having_come from Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), are_being_gathered_together to him,
\v 2 and having_seen some of_the apprentices/followers of_him, that they_are_eating the loaves with_unclean hands, this is with_unwashed.
\v 3 (For/Because the Farisaios_\add party\add* and all the Youdaiōns, are_ not _eating if they_may_ not _wash the hands with_\add the\add*_fist, taking_hold_of the tradition of_the elders,
\v 4 and from \add the\add*_marketplace they_are_ not _eating if they_may_ not _wash, and many other \add things\add* there_is which they_received to_be_taking_hold_of, washings of_cups and pitchers and copper_kettles.)
\v 5 And the Farisaios_\add party\add* are_asking him and the scribes: For/Because_ why _reason the apprentices/followers of_you are_ not _walking according_to the tradition of_the elders, but they_are_eating the bread with_common hands?
\v 6 And he answering said to_them: Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊ\sup yāh\sup*) rightly prophesied concerning you_all the hypocrites, as it_has_been_written, that This the people is_honouring me with_the lips, but the heart of_them is_being_away far_away from me.
\v 7 And they_are_worshipping me uselessly, teaching \add the\add*_commands of_humans as_teachings.
\v 8 Having_left the command of_ the _\nd god\nd*, you_all_are_taking_hold_of the tradition of_ the _humans.
\v 9 And he_was_saying to_them: You_all_are_rejecting well the command of_ the _\nd god\nd*, in_order_that you_all_may_keep the tradition of_you_all.
\v 10 For/Because Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) said: Be_honouring the father of_you and the mother of_you, and: The \add one\add* speaking_evil father or mother let_be_dying in_death.
\v 11 But you_all are_saying: If \add a\add*_person may_say to_the father or the mother: whatever you_may_be_benefited if from me \add it_is\add* Korban (that is \add a\add*_gift,
\v 12 you_all_are_ no_longer _allowing him to_do nothing for_the father or the mother,

\v 15 there_is nothing outside the person entering_in into him, which is_able to_defile him but the \add things\add* going_out out_of the person is the \add things\add* defiling the person.

\v 17 And when he_came_in into \add the\add*_house from the crowd, the apprentices/followers of_him were_asking him the parable.

\v 19 because it_is_ not _entering_in into the heart of_him but into the belly, and it_is_going_out into the latrine? (Purifying all the foods.)
\v 20 And he_was_saying that The \add thing\add* going_out out_of the person, that is_defiling the person.
\v 21 For/Because from inside the heart of_ the _people are_going_out the the evil speculations, sexual_immoralities, thefts, murders, adulteries,
\v 22 greediness, wickedness, deceit, wantonness, eyeing evil, slander, pride, foolishness.
\v 23 All these the evil \add things\add* inside is_going_out and is_defiling the person.

\v 22 And often it_throw him both into fire and into waters in_order_that it_may_destroy him. But if anything you_are_being_able, give_help to_us, having_been_feeling_compassion on us.

\v 29 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_them: Also_I I_will_be_asking you_all one message, and answer to_me, and I_will_be_telling to_you_all by what authority I_am_doing these \add things\add*.
\v 30 The immersion which of_Yōannaʸs, was_it from heaven or from humans? Answer to_me.

\v 32 But we_may_say: From humans? (They_were_fearing the crowd, because/for all were_having that the Yōannaʸs he_ really _was \add a\add*_prophet.)
\v 33 And answering to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* they_are_saying: We_have_ not _known. And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: Neither I am_telling to_you_all by what authority I_am_doing these \add things\add*.

\v 1 And he_began to_be_speaking to_them in parables: \add A\add*_man planted \add a\add*_vineyard and put_ \add a\add*_fence _around, and dug \add a\add*_trough, and built \add a\add*_tower, and rented_out it to_\add the\add*_tenant_farmers, and travelled.

\v 6 He_was_having still one beloved son, he_sent_ him _out last to them saying, that They_will_be_being_swayed by_the son of_me.
\v 7 But those the tenant_farmers said to themselves, that This is the heir, come, we_may_kill_ him _off, and the inheritance will_be of_us.
\v 8 And having_taken, they_killed_ him _off, and they_throw_ him _out outside the vineyard.
\v 9 Therefore what ˓will˒_ the master of_the vineyard _be_doing? He_will_be_coming and will_be_destroying the tenant_farmers, and will_be_giving the vineyard to_others.
\v 10 You_all_ not_even _read the this scripture: \add The\add*_stone which the \add ones\add* building rejected, this was_become for \add the\add*_head of_\add the\add*_corner,

\v 12 And they_were_seeking to_apprehend him, and they_were_afraid the crowd, because/for they_knew that he_spoke the parable against them. And having_left him, they_went_away.
\v 13 And they_are_sending_out some of_the Farisaios_\add party\add* and of_the supporters_of_Haʸrōdaʸs to him, in_order_that they_may_catch him in_\add a\add*_statement.
\v 14 And having_come, they_are_saying to_him: Teacher, we_have_known that you_are true, and is_ not _caring to_you about no_one, because/for you_are_ not _looking on appearance of_people, but you_are_teaching the way of_ the _\nd god\nd* with \add the\add*_truth. Is_it_permitting to_give \add a\add*_poll_tax to_Kaisar or not? May_we_give or we_may_ not _give?
\v 15 And he having_known the hypocrisy of_them, said to_them: Why are_you_all_testing me? Be_bringing to_me \add a\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add*, in_order_that I_may_see \add it\add*.
\v 16 And they brought \add it\add*. And he_is_saying to_them: Of_whose \add is\add* the this image and the inscription? And they said to_him: Of_Kaisar.
\v 17 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_them: The \add things\add* of_Kaisar give_back to_Kaisar, and the \add things\add* of_ the _\nd god\nd* to_ the _\nd god\nd*. And they_were_begrudgingly_amazed at him.
\v 18 And \add the\add*_Saddoukaios_\add sect\add* are_coming to him, who are_saying to_ not _be \add a\add*_resurrection, and they_were_asking him saying,
\v 19 Teacher, Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) wrote to_us, that if \add A\add*_brother of_anyone may_die_off, and may_leave \add a\add*_wife and may_ not _leave children, that the brother of_him may_take the wife, and may_raise_up seed for_the brother of_him.
\v 20 There_were seven brothers, and the first took \add a\add*_wife, and dying_off, not left seed,

\v 23 In the resurrection, of_which of_them will_be_she \add the\add*_wife? For/Because the seven had her as_\add a\add*_wife.
\v 24 the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_saying to_them: Not are_you_all_being_strayed because_of this, not having_known the scriptures, nor the power of_ the _\nd god\nd*?
\v 25 For/Because whenever they_may_rise_up from \add the\add*_dead, they_are_ neither _marrying nor are_being_betrothed, but they_are like messengers in the heavens.
\v 26 But concerning the dead, that they_are_being_raised, not you_all_read in the scroll of_Mōsaʸs concerning the thorn_bush, how the \nd god\nd* spoke to_him saying: I \add am\add* the \nd god\nd* of_Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām), and \nd god\nd* of_Isaʼak/(Yiʦḩāq), and the \nd god\nd* of_Yakōb/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ)?

\v 28 And one of_the scribes having_approached, having_heard of_them debating, having_seen that he_answered well to_them, asked him: Which command is \add the\add*_first of_all?
\v 29 the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answered, that \add The\add*_first is: Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*) be_hearing, \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* the \nd god\nd* of_us is one \nd master\nd*,
\v 30 and you_will_be_loving \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* the \nd god\nd* of_you, with all the heart of_you, and with all the soul of_you, and with all the mind of_you, and with all the strength of_you.
\v 31 \add The\add*_second \add is\add* this: You_will_be_loving the neighbor of_you as yourself. Another command is not greater \add than\add* these.
\v 32 And the scribe said to_him: Rightly, Teacher, in truth having_said, that He_is one, and there_is not another except him,
\v 33 and, the To_be_loving him with all the heart, and with all the intelligence, and with all the strength, and, which To_be_loving his neighbor as himself, is more_important all the whole_burnt_offerings and sacrifices.
\v 34 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_seen him, that he_answered intelligently, said to_him: You_are not far from the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*. And no_one no_longer was_daring to_ask him.
\v 35 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering, teaching in the temple was_saying: How are_ the scribes _saying that the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* is \add the\add*_son of_Dawid/(Dāvid)?
\v 36 Dawid himself said by the the holy \nd spirit\nd*: The \nd master\nd* said to_the \nd master\nd* of_me: Be_sitting on \add the\add*_right of_me, until wishfully I_may_put the enemies of_you beneath of_the feet of_you.
\v 37 Dawid himself is_calling him: \nd master\nd*, and from_where is_he son of_him? And the great crowd was_ gladly _hearing from_him.
\v 38 And in the teaching of_him, he_was_saying: Be_watching_out of the scribes, the \add ones\add* wanting to_be_walking in robes, and greetings in the marketplaces,
\v 39 and best_seats in the synagogues, and best_places at the suppers,
\v 40 the \add ones\add* devouring the houses of_the widows, and praying long for_\add a\add*_under_pretense. These will_be_receiving more_excessive judgement.
\v 41 And having_sat_down in_front_of the treasury, he_was_observing how the crowd is_throwing money into the treasury, and many rich were_throwing much.
\v 42 And one poor widow having_come, throw two leptons, which is \add a\add*_quadran.
\v 43 And having_called_to the apprentices/followers of_him, he_said to_them: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that the this the poor widow, throw more \add than\add* all of_the \add ones\add* throwing into the treasury.
\v 44 For/Because all throw from the \add wealth\add* being_plentiful to_them, but this \add woman\add* she_was_having throw all out_of the poverty of_her, as_much_as all the living of_her.

\v 3 And of_him sitting on the Mount of_ the _Olives in_front_of the temple, Petros, and Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), and Yōannaʸs, and Andreas was_asking, him by themselves,

\v 61 But he was_keeping_silent and not answered nothing. Again the chief_priest was_asking him and is_saying to_him: Are you the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, the son the blessed \add one\add*?
\v 62 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said: I am. And you_all_will_be_seeing the son of_ the _man sitting on \add the\add*_right of_the power, and coming with the clouds of_the sky.
\v 63 And the chief_priest having_torn the clothes of_him is_saying: What need anymore are_we_having of_witnesses?
\v 64 You_all_heard of_the slander. What is_it_appearing to_you_all? And the \add ones\add* all condemned him liable to_be of_death.
\v 65 And some began to_be_spitting on_him, and to_be_blindfolding the face of_him, and to_be_beating him, and to_be_saying to_him: Prophesy. And the attendants received him with_slaps.
\v 66 And the Petros being below in the courtyard, one of_the servant_girls of_the chief_priest is_coming,
\v 67 and having_seen the Petros warming \add himself\add*, having_focused_in to_him she_is_saying: You also were with \nd Yaʸsous\nd* the the Nazaraʸnos.
\v 68 But he disowned \add it\add* saying: I_have_ neither _known, nor I_am_understanding you what are_saying. And he_came_out out into the forecourt.
\v 69 And the servant_girl having_seen him, began again to_be_saying to_the \add ones\add* having_stood_by, that He is of them.
\v 70 But again he was_disowning \add him\add*. And after \add a\add*_little, again the \add ones\add* having_stood_by were_saying to_ the _Petros: Truly you_are from them, because/for you_are also \add a\add*_Galilaios,
\v 71 but he began to_be_cursing and to_be_swearing, that I_have_ not _known the this man, whom you_all_are_speaking. 
\v 72 And immediately for \add the\add*_second \add time\add* \add a\add*_rooster crowed. And the Petros was_reminded the message as the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_him, that Before \add the\add*_rooster to_crow three-times you_will_be_renouncing me, and having_broken_down, he_was_weeping.

\v 1 And immediately in_the_morning, the chief_priests having_established \add a\add*_counsel, with the elders and scribes, and all the council, having_bound the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, they_carried_ \add him\add* _away and they_gave_ \add him\add* _over to_Pilatos.
\v 2 And the Pilatos asked him: Are you the king of_the Youdaiōns? And he answering to_him is_saying: You are_saying \add it\add*.
\v 3 And the chief_priests were_accusing many \add things\add* against_him.
\v 4 And the Pilatos again asked him saying: You_are_ not _answering nothing? Behold, how_many \add things\add* they_are_accusing against_you. 
\v 5 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* no_longer answered nothing, so_as the Pilatos to_be_marvelling.
\v 6 And on \add the\add*_feast, he_was_sending_away to_them one prisoner, whom they_were_excusing.
\v 7 And was the \add one\add* being_called Barabbas, having_been_bound with the insurrectionists, who had_done murder in the insurrection.
\v 8 And having_gone_up, the crowd began to_be_requesting as he_was_doing for_them.
\v 9 But the Pilatos answered to_them saying: Are_you_all_wanting I_may_send_ The king of_the Youdaiōns _away to_you_all?
\v 10 For/Because he_was_knowing that the chief_priests had_given_ him _over because_of envy.
\v 11 But the chief_priests stirred_up the crowd, in_order_that he_may_ rather _send_away the Barabbas to_them.
\v 12 And the Pilatos again answering was_saying to_them: Therefore what I_may_do which you_all_are_calling the king of_the Youdaiōns?
\v 13 And they cried_out again: Execute_on_a_stake him. 
\v 14 And the Pilatos was_saying to_them: For/Because what evil he_did? But they exceedingly cried_out: Execute_on_a_stake him. 
\v 15 And the Pilatos wishing to_do, the much for_the crowd sent_ The Barabbas _away to_them, and having_flogged \add him\add*, gave_ The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* _over in_order_that he_may_be_executed_on_a_stake.
\v 16 And the soldiers led_ him _away within the palace, that is \add the\add*_residence_of_the_governor, and they_are_calling_together all the cohort.
\v 17 And they_are_dressing_ him _in purple, and having_twisted_together \add a\add*_thorny crown they_are_putting_around to_him,
\v 18 and they_began to_be_greeting him: Greetings, king of_the Youdaiōns. 
\v 19 And they_were_striking the head of_him with_\add a\add*_staff and they_were_spitting on_him, and kneeling the knees, they_were_prostrating before_him.
\v 20 And when they_mocked at_him, they_stripped_ the purple \add garment\add* _off him, and they_dressed_ him _in the own clothes of_him. And they_are_leading_ him _out in_order_that they_may_execute_on_a_stake him.
\v 21 And they_are_compelling \add a\add*_certain_ from_Kuraʸnaʸ _\add man\add* passing_by, Simōn, coming from \add the\add*_country, the father of_Alexandros and Ɽoufos, in_order_that he_may_carry the stake of_him.
\v 22 And they_are_bringing him to the Golgotha/(Gulgolet), place which is being_translated: place Of_\add the\add*_skull.
\v 23 And they_were_giving wine to_him having_been_mixed_with_myrrh, but which he_ not _took.
\v 24 And having_executed_on_a_stake him, they_are_dividing the clothes of_him, throwing \add a\add*_lot for them, and_who may_take_ what _away.
\v 25 And it_was \add the\add*_ third _hour, and they_executed_on_a_stake him.
\v 26 And the inscription of_the charge of_him having_been_inscribed was: The king of_the Youdaiōns.
\v 27 And they_are_executing_on_a_stake two robbers with him, one on \add the\add*_right and one on \add the\add*_left of_him.
\v 28
\v 29 And the \add ones\add* passing_through were_slandering him, shaking the heads of_them, and saying: Aha, you tearing_down the temple and building \add it\add* in three days,
\v 30 having_come_down from the stake, save yourself. 
\v 31 Likewise also the chief_priests, mocking to one_another with the scribes were_saying: He_saved others, he_is_ not _able to_save himself.
\v 32 The \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, the king of_Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*), let_come_down now from the stake, in_order_that we_may_see and we_may_believe. And the \add ones\add* having_been_executed_on_a_stake_with with him were_deriding him.
\v 33 And having_become \add the\add*_ sixth _hour, darkness became over all the land, until \add the\add*_ ninth _hour.
\v 34 And the ninth hour, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* shouted with_\add a\add*_ loud _voice: Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? Which is being_translated: - \nd god\nd* of_me, the \nd god\nd* of_me, because/for why you_abandoned me?
\v 35 And some of_the \add ones\add* having_stood_by, having_heard were_saying: Behold, he_is_calling Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*).
\v 36 And someone having_run, and having_filled \add a\add*_sponge with_wine_vinegar having_put_around around_\add a\add*_reed, was_giving_ him _to_drink saying: Leave \add it\add*, we_may_see if Aʸlias is_coming to_take_ him _down.
\v 37 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_sent_away with_\add a\add*_ loud _cry, expired.
\v 38 And the curtain of_the temple was_torn into two, from top to bottom.
\v 39 And the centurion having_seen which having_stood_by from opposite of_him that he_expired thus said: Truly this the man was \add the\add*_son of_\nd god\nd*. 
\v 40 And were also women observing from afar, among whom both Maria/(Miryām) the from_Magdala, and Maria the mother of_Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ) the little and of_Yōsaʸs/(Yōşēf?), and Salōmaʸ,
