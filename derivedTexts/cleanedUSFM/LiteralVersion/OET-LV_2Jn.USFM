\v 1 The elder, to_\add the\add*_chosen mistress and the children of_her, whom I am_loving in truth (and not I only, but also all the \add ones\add* having_known the truth),
\v 2 because_of the truth which remaining in us, and will_be with us to the age:
\v 3 grace, mercy, peace will_be with us from \nd god\nd* \add the\add*_father and from \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*, the son of_the father, in truth and love.
\v 4 I_was_ exceedingly _elated that I_have_found \add some\add* of the children of_you walking in truth, as \add the\add*_command we_received from the father.
\v 5 And now I_am_asking you, mistress, not as writing \add a\add*_ new _command, to_you, but what we_were_having from \add the\add*_beginning, that we_may_be_loving one_another.
\v 6 And this is the love: that we_may_be_walking according_to the commands of_him. This is the command, as you_all_heard from \add the\add*_beginning, that you_all_may_be_walking in same.
\v 7 Because many deceivers came_out into the world, the \add ones\add* not confessing \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd* coming in flesh. This \add one\add* is the deceiver and the anti-messiah.
\v 8 Be_seeing yourselves that you_all_may_ not _lose what \add things\add* you_did, but you_all_may_take_back \add a\add*_ full _reward.
\v 9 Everyone which going_beyond and not remaining in the teaching of_the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, is_ not _having \nd god\nd*, the \add one\add* remaining in the teaching, this \add one\add* is_having both the father and the son.
\v 10 If anyone is_coming to you_all, and is_ not _bringing this the teaching, not be_receiving him into \add your\add*_house, and not be_saying to_be_rejoicing to_him, 
\v 11 for/because the \add one\add* saying to_him to_be_rejoicing is_sharing in_the the evil works of_him.
\v 12 Having many \add things\add* to_be_writing to_you_all, I_was_ not _counseled through paper and ink, but I_am_hoping to_become to you_all, and to_speak mouth to mouth, in_order_that the joy of_you_all may_be having_been_fulfilled.
\v 13 The children of_the the chosen sister of_you is_greeting you.
