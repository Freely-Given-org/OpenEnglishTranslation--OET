\v 1 Indeed the first account I_made concerning all \add things\add*, Oh Theofilos, of_which \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* began both to_be_doing and to_be_teaching,
\v 2 until which day having_commanded by \add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd* to_the ambassadors, whom he_chose, he_was_taken_up, 
\v 3 to_whom also after the \add time\add* him to_suffer he_presented himself living, with many proofs through forty days, appearing to_them, and speaking the \add things\add* concerning the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 4 And assembling_together, he_commanded to_them: From Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) not to_be_being_departed, but to_be_awaiting the promise of_the father, which you_all_heard from_me.
\v 5 Because Yōannaʸs on_one_hand immersed in_water, on_the_other_hand you_all will_be_being_immersed in \add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*, after many not these days.
\v 6 Therefore indeed the \add ones\add* having_come_together, were_asking him saying: \nd master\nd*, if at the this time, are_you_restoring the kingdom the to_Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*)?
\v 7 And he_said to them: It_is not of_you_all to_know times or seasons, which the father set by his own authority.
\v 8 But you_all_will_be_receiving power, having_ The holy \nd spirit\nd* _come_over on you_all, and you_all_will_be witnesses for_me, in both Hierousalaʸm, and in all the Youdaia, and Samareia/(Shomrōn), and to \add the\add*_last \add part\add* of_the earth.
\v 9 And having_said these \add things\add*, seeing them, he_was_lifted_up and \add a\add*_cloud took_ him _up from the eyes of_them.
\v 10 And as they_were looking_intently into the sky, him going, also see two men in white clothing, had_stood_by to_them,
\v 11 who also said: Men, Galilaios, why you_all_have_stood looking at the sky? This the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* which having_been_taken_up from you_all into the heaven, thus will_be_coming which manner you_all_saw him going into the heaven.
\v 12 Then they_returned to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) from \add the\add*_mountain which being_called of_Olivet, which is near Hierousalaʸm, having journey of_\add a\add*_day_of_rest.
\v 13 And when they_came_in, into the upper_room, they_went_up where they_were staying, which and/both Petros and Yōannaʸs and Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ) and Andreas, Filippos and Thōmas, Bartholomaios and Matthaios, Yakōbos of_Alfaios, and Simōn the Farisaios_zaʸlōtaʸs_\add group_member\add*, and Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) of_Yakōbos.
\v 14 These all were persevering the in_prayer with_one_accord, with \add the\add*_women and Maria/(Miryām) the mother of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd*, and the brothers of_him.
\v 15 And in the these days, Petros having_stood_up in \add the\add*_midst of_the brothers said (and \add the\add*_crowd of_names with the same was about \add a\add*_hundred twenty),
\v 16 Men, brothers, it_was_fitting the scripture to_be_fulfilled, which the the holy \nd spirit\nd* previously_said by \add the\add*_mouth of_Dawid/(Dāvid) concerning Youdas, the \add one\add* having_become guide to_the \add ones\add* having_captured \nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 17 Because he_was having_been_numbered with us, and obtained the \add an\add*_allotment of_ the this _service.
\v 18 (Therefore indeed this \add man\add* acquired \add a\add*_field out_of \add the\add*_reward of_ the _unrighteousness, and having_become headlong, he_burst_open in_\add the\add*_middle, and all the intestines of_him was_poured_out.
\v 19 And it_became known to_all the \add ones\add* dwelling_in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), so_that that the field to_be_called in_their language of_them, Akeldama, this is: field of_blood.)
\v 20 For/Because it_has_been_written in scroll of_psalms, the \add the\add*_homestead of_him Let_be_become desolate, and let_ not _be the \add one\add* dwelling in it, and: let_ another _take The overseeing of_him.
\v 21 Therefore it_is_fitting of_the men having_come_together with_us, at all \add the\add*_time that the \nd master Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* came_in and came_out with us,
\v 22 having_begun from the immersion of_Yōannaʸs until the day in_which he_was_taken_up from us, \add a\add*_witness of_the resurrection of_him with us, to_become one of_these.
\v 23 And they_set two, Yōsaʸf/(Yōşēf) which being_called Barsabbas, who was_called Youstos, and Matthias.
\v 24 And having_prayed, they_said: You \nd master\nd*, heart_knower of_all, reveal which one you_chose of these the two,
\v 25 to_take the this place of_ the _service and commission, from which Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) broke_from, to_be_gone to his the own place.
\v 26 And they_gave lots to_them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he_was_chosen_together_with with the eleven ambassadors.

\v 1 And at the \add time\add* the day the of_pentecost to_be_being_fulfilled, they_were all together in the same \add place\add*.
\v 2 And suddenly \add a\add*_sound became out_of the heaven, as being_carried of_\add a\add*_ forceful _wind, and it_filled all the house where they_were sitting.
\v 3 And dividing tongues as_if of_fire were_seen to_them, and sat_down on each one of_them.
\v 4 And they_were_ all _filled with_\add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*, and they_began to_be_speaking with_other tongues, as the \nd spirit\nd* was_giving to_them to_be_speaking_out.
\v 5 And Youdaiōns were dwelling in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), devout men from every nation of_the \add nations\add* under the heaven.
\v 6 And of_ the this _sound having_become, the multitude came_together and was_confounded, because each one heard speaking of_them in_his. own language.
\v 7 And they_were_amazed and they_were_marvelling saying: Behold are not, all these who \add are\add* speaking Galilaios?
\v 8 And how are_ we _hearing each in_the own language of_us, in which we_were_born?
\v 9 \add ones\add*_from_Parthia, and \add ones\add*_from_Maʸdia, and \add ones\add*_from_Elam, and the \add ones\add* dwelling_in the Mesopotamia, Youdaia and and/both Kappadokia, Pontos and the Asia,
\v 10 Frugia and and/both Pamfulia, Aiguptos/(Miʦrayim), and the parts of_ the _Libuaʸ which along Kuraʸnaʸ, and the \add ones\add* Ɽōmaios visiting,
\v 11 both Youdaiōns and converts, \add ones\add*_from_Kraʸtaʸ and \add ones\add*_from_Arabia, we_are_hearing them speaking, the great \add things\add* of_ the _\nd god\nd* the in_our tongues.
\v 12 And all were_marvelling and were_thoroughly_perplexed, another saying to another: What is_wanting this to_be?
\v 13 But others mocking were_saying, that They_are having_been_filled of_sweet_wine.
\v 14 But the Petros having_been_stood with the eleven, lifted_up the voice of_him and spoke_out to_them: Men, \add ones\add*_from_Youdaia, and all you_all dwelling_in Hierousalaʸm, let_ this _be known to_you_all and give_ear to_the messages of_me.
\v 15 For/Because these are_ not _being_drunk as you_all are_supposing, because/for it_is \add the\add*_ third _hour, of_the day,
\v 16 but this is the \add message\add* having_been_spoken by the prophet Yōaʸl/(Yō\sup ʼēl\sup*):
\v 17 And it_will_be in the last days, the \nd god\nd* is_saying: I_will_be_pouring_out of the \nd spirit\nd* of_me on all flesh, and the sons of_you_all will_be_prophesying, and the daughters of_you_all, and the young_men of_you_all will_be_seeing visions, and the elders of_you_all in_dreams will_be_being_dreamt, 
\v 18 and surely I_will_be_pouring_out of the \nd spirit\nd* of_me on the slaves of_me, and on the handmaidens of_me, in the those days, and they_will_be_prophesying.
\v 19 And I_will_be_giving wonders in the sky above, and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapour of_smoke.
\v 20 The sun will_be_being_altered into darkness and the moon into blood, before \add the\add*_ the great and glorious _day of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* to_come.
\v 21 And it_will_be, everyone who wishfully may_call on_the name of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* will_be_being_saved.
\v 22 Men, \add ones\add*_from_Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*), hear the messages these: \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* the from_Nazaret, \add a\add*_man having_been_demonstrated by the \nd god\nd* to you_all by_miracles, and wonders, and signs, which the \nd god\nd* did by him in \add the\add*_midst of_you_all, as you_all_ yourselves _have_known.
\v 23 This \add man\add* by_the, having_been_designated counsel and foreknowledge of_ the _\nd god\nd*, delivered_up by \add the\add*_hand of_\add the\add*_lawless \add ones\add*, you_all_killed having_executed_on_a_stake.
\v 24 Whom the \nd god\nd* raised_up, having_untied/released the agonies of_the death, as_much_as was not possible him to_be_being_restrained by it.
\v 25 For/Because Dawid/(Dāvid) is_saying to him: I_was_foreseeing the \nd master\nd* before me through all \add time\add*, because he_is on \add the\add*_right of_me, in_order_that I_may_ not _be_shaken.
\v 26 Because_of this the heart of_me was_gladdened, and the tongue of_me exulted, and still also the flesh of_me will_be_nesting in hope, 
\v 27 because you_˓will˒_ not _be_abandoning the soul of_me into Haidaʸs, nor ˓will˒_you_be_giving the devout \add one\add* of_you to_see decay.
\v 28 You_made_known to_me \add the\add*_ways of_life, you_will_be_filling me with_gladness with the presence of_you.
\v 29 Men, brothers, it_is_permitting to_speak with confidence to you_all concerning the patriarch Dawid that he_ both _died and was_buried, and the tomb of_him is among us until the this day.
\v 30 Therefore being \add a\add*_prophet, and having_known that - \nd god\nd* swore to_him with_\add an\add*_oath: of \add the\add*_fruit of_the loin of_him, to_sit_down on the throne of_him.
\v 31 Having_foreseen, he_spoke concerning the resurrection of_the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* that neither was_abandoned into Haidaʸs, nor the flesh of_him saw decay.
\v 32 This the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* the \nd god\nd* raised_up, of_which all we are witnesses.
\v 33 Therefore having_been_exalted by_the right \add hand\add* of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and having_received the promise of_the the holy \nd spirit\nd*, from the father, he_poured_ this _out which you_all are_seeing and are_hearing.
\v 34 For/Because Dawid/(Dāvid) not went_up into the heavens, but himself is_saying, \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* Said to_the \nd master\nd* of_me: Be_sitting on \add the\add*_right of_me,
\v 35 until wishfully I_may_put the enemies of_you \add a\add*_footstool of_the feet of_you.
\v 36 Assuredly therefore let_ All \add the\add*_house of_Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*) _be_knowing that the \nd god\nd* made him both \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* and \add the\add*_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, this the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* whom you_all executed_on_a_stake.
\v 37 And having_heard, they_were_pierced to_the heart, both they_said to the Petros and the other ambassadors: What may_we_do, men, brothers?
\v 38 And Petros is_saying to them: Repent: and let_ each of_you_all _be_immersed in the name of_\nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd*, because/for forgiveness of_the sins of_you_all, and you_all_will_be_receiving the gift of_the holy \nd spirit\nd*.
\v 39 For/Because the promise is to_you_all, and to_the children of_you_all, and to_all the \add ones\add* at far, as_many_as wishfully may_call_to \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, the \nd god\nd* of_us.
\v 40 Both with_ more _other messages he_testified, and was_exhorting them saying: Be_saved from this the crooked the generation.
\v 41 Therefore indeed the \add ones\add* having_welcomed the message of_him were_immersed, and were_added on the that day, about three_thousand souls.
\v 42 And they_were persevering in_the teaching of_the ambassadors, and the in_fellowship, the breaking of_the bread, and the in_prayers.
\v 43 And reverence was_becoming on_every soul, and many wonders and signs was_becoming through the ambassadors.
\v 44 And all the \add ones\add* having_believed were with the same \add purpose\add*, and they_were_having all common \add things\add*,
\v 45 and they_were_selling their properties and their possessions, and they_were_dividing them to_all, anyone was_having as_much_as would need.
\v 46 And in_every day persevering with_one_accord in the temple, and breaking bread in_every house, they_were_partaking of_food with exultation and simplicity of_heart,
\v 47 praising the \nd god\nd* and having favour with all the people. And the \nd master\nd* was_adding the \add ones\add* being_saved with the same. in_every day.

\v 1 And Petros also Yōannaʸs were_going_up into the temple at the hour the of_prayer the ninth \add hour\add*.
\v 2 And \add a\add*_certain man, being lame from \add the\add*_womb of_\add the\add*_mother of_him, was_being_borne, whom they_were_putting in_every day at the door of_the temple, which being_called Beautiful, which to_be_requesting alms from the \add ones\add* entering_in into the temple.
\v 3 Who having_seen Petros and Yōannaʸs going to_be_entering into the temple, was_asking to_receive alms.
\v 4 But Petros having_looked_intently at him with the Yōannaʸs said: Look to us.
\v 5 And he was_holding_on to_them, expecting to_receive something from them.
\v 6 But Petros said: Silver and gold is_ not _being to_me, but this what I_am_having, I_am_giving to_you, in the name of_\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd* of_the from_Nazaret, be_walking. 
\v 7 And having_grabbed him by_the right hand, he_raised him, and immediately the feet of_him and the ankles were_strengthened.
\v 8 And leaping_up, he_stood and was_walking, and came_in with them into the temple, walking, and springing_up, and praising the \nd god\nd*.
\v 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising the \nd god\nd*.
\v 10 And they_were_recognizing him that he was the \add one\add* sitting at the Beautiful gate of_the temple for the alms, and they_were_filled with_amazement and amazement at the \add thing\add* having_been_happened to_him.
\v 11 And of_him taking_hold_of the Petros and the Yōannaʸs, all the people ran_together to them in the portico which being_called of_Solomōn/(Shəlmoh), greatly_amazed.
\v 12 But the Petros having_seen \add it\add*, answered to the people: Men, \add ones\add*_from_Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*), why you_all_are_wondering at this, or why you_all_are_looking_intently at_us, as_though by_\add our\add*_own power or devoutness having_made him which to_be_walking?
\v 13 The \nd god\nd* of_Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām), and the \add the\add*_\nd god\nd* of_Isaʼak/(Yiʦḩāq), and the \add the\add*_\nd god\nd* of_Yakōb/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), the \nd god\nd* of_the fathers of_us, glorified the servant of_him, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, whom you_all indeed gave_over, and disowned in \add the\add*_presence of_Pilatos, that \add one\add* having_judged to_be_sending_away \add him\add*.
\v 14 But you_all disowned the holy \add one\add* and righteous \add one\add*, and you_all_requested \add a\add*_man \add a\add*_murderer to_be_granted to_you_all,
\v 15 but you_all_killed_off the originator of_ the _life, whom the \nd god\nd* raised from \add the\add*_dead, of_which we are witnesses.
\v 16 And the faith in_the name of_him, this \add man\add* whom you_all_are_observing and you_all_have_known, strengthened the name of_him, and the faith which \add is\add* by him, gave the complete_healing to_him this in_front_of all of_you.
\v 17 And now, brothers, I_have_known that you_all_did in ignorance, as also the rulers of_you_all.
\v 18 But what \add things\add* the \nd god\nd* foretold by \add the\add*_mouth of_all the prophets, the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* of_him to_suffer, he_fulfilled thus.
\v 19 Therefore repent and turn_back, because/for the \add time\add* of_you_all the sins to_be_wiped_out,
\v 20 so_that wishfully times of_refreshment may_come from \add the\add*_presence of_the \nd master\nd*, and he_may_send_out the \add one\add* having_been_appointed to_you_all \add the\add*_\nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*,
\v 21 whom indeed it_is_fitting heaven to_receive, until \add the\add*_times of_restoration of_all \add things\add*, which the \nd god\nd* spoke from \add the\add*_age by \add the\add*_mouth of_the holy prophets of_him.
\v 22 Indeed Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) said, that \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, the \nd god\nd* of_us will_be_raising_up \add A\add*_prophet to_you_all like of_you_all me from the brothers, you_all_will_be_hearing from_him in all \add things\add*, as_many_as wishfully he_may_speak to you_all.
\v 23 And it_will_be \add that\add* every soul, whoever if may_ not _hear the from_ that _prophet, will_be_being_wholly_destroyed from the people.
\v 24 And also all the prophets from Samouaʸl/(Shəmū\sup ʼēl\sup*) and the \add ones\add* consecutively, as_many_as spoke, also proclaimed the these days.
\v 25 You_all are the sons of_the prophets, and of_the covenant which the \nd god\nd* covenanted with the fathers of_you_all, saying to Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām): And in the seed of_you all the families of_the earth will_be_being_blessed.
\v 26 the \nd god\nd* having_raised_up the servant of_him, sent_ him _out To_you_all first, blessing you_all in that to_be_turning_away each from the wickedness of_you_all.

\v 1 And of_them speaking to the people, the chief_priests, and the officer of_the temple, and the Saddoukaios_\add sect\add* approached to_them,
\v 2 being_thoroughly_disturbing because_of the \add thing\add* them to_be_teaching to_the people, and to_be_proclaiming the resurrection in the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, which \add is\add* from \add the\add*_dead.
\v 3 And they_laid_ their _on on_them hands, and they_put \add them\add* in jail to the_ next _\add day\add*, because/for it_was already evening.
\v 4 But many the \add ones\add* having_heard the message, believed and number of_the men was_become about five thousands.
\v 5 And it_became on the_ next _\add day\add* the rulers of_them, and the elders, and the scribes to_be_gathered_together in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim),
\v 6 and Annas the chief_priest, and Kaiafas, and Yōannaʸs, and Alexandros, and as_many_as were of chief_priestly descent.
\v 7 And having_stood them in the midst, they_were_inquiring: In what power or in what name you_all did this?
\v 8 Then Petros having_been_filled with_\add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*, said to them: Rulers of_the people and elders,
\v 9 if we today are_being_examined on \add a\add*_good_work to_\add the\add*_ sick _man, by what this \add one\add* has_been_healed,
\v 10 it_let_be known to_all you_all and to_all the people of_Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*), that in the name of_\nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd* the from_Nazaret, whom you_all executed_on_a_stake, whom the \nd god\nd* raised from \add the\add*_dead, by this \add name\add* this \add man\add* has_stood_by before you_all healthy.
\v 11 This \add one\add* is the stone which having_been_scorned by you_all, the builders, which having_become to \add the\add*_head of_\add the\add*_corner.
\v 12 And not_one the is not in other salvation, because/for there_is not another name under the heaven which having_been_given among people, by which it_is_fitting us to_be_saved.
\v 13 And observing the boldness of_ the _Petros and of_Yōannaʸs, and having_grasped that they_are illiterate and ordinary men, they_were_marvelling, and they_were_recognizing them that they_were with the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 14 And seeing the man having_stood with them, the \add one\add* having_been_healed, they_were_having nothing to_speak_against \add them\add*.
\v 15 But having_commanded them to_go_away outside the council, they_were_conferring with one_another
\v 16 saying: What we_may_do to_ the these _men? For/Because indeed that has_become \add a\add*_known sign through them, to_all the \add ones\add* dwelling_in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) \add is\add* manifest, and we_are_ not _being_able to_be_disowning \add it\add*.
\v 17 But in_order_that may_ not _be_spread on more among the people, we_may_threaten to_them to_ no_longer _be_speaking in the this name to_no_one of_\add the\add*_people.
\v 18 And having_called them, they_commanded \add them\add* not to_be_speaking nor to_be_teaching in the name of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd* at_all.
\v 19 But the Petros and Yōannaʸs answering said to them: Judge whether it_is right before the \nd god\nd*, to_be_hearing from_you_all rather than the from_\nd god\nd*.
\v 20 For/Because we are_ not _being_able to_be_ not _speaking what we_saw and we_heard.
\v 21 And they having_further_threatened \add them\add* sent_ them _away, finding nothing which how they_may_punish them, because_of the people, because all were_glorifying the \nd god\nd* for the \add thing\add* having_become.
\v 22 For/Because the man on whom this the sign of_the healing had_become was more years \add than\add* forty.
\v 23 And having_been_sent_away, they_came to their own, and they_reported as_much_as the chief_priests and the elders said to them.
\v 24 And which having_heard, with_one_accord lifted_up \add their\add*_voice to the \nd god\nd* and said: Master, you which having_made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the \add things\add* in them,
\v 25 the \add one\add* of_the father of_us, by \add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd* of_\add the\add*_mouth Dawid/(Dāvid) servant of_you having_said: For/Because_ why _reason \add the\add*_pagans raged, and peoples pondered vain \add things\add*?
\v 26 Standing_before the kings of_the earth and the rulers were_gathered_together with the themselves against the \nd master\nd*, and against the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* of_him.
\v 27 For/Because both Haʸrōdaʸs and Pontios Pilatos were_gathered_together in truth in the this city with \add the\add*_pagans and peoples of_Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*) against the holy servant of_you \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, whom you_anointed,

\v 29 And the \add things\add* now, \nd master\nd*, look_upon on the threats of_them, and give to_the slaves of_you, all to_be_speaking the of_you message with boldness,
\v 30 in that the hand to_be_stretching_out to_you for healing, and signs, and wonders, to_be_becoming through the name of_the holy servant of_you, \nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 31 And having_been_besought of_them, the place in which they_were having_been_gathered_together was_shaken, and all were_filled the holy \nd spirit\nd*, and they_were_speaking the message of_ the _\nd god\nd* with boldness.
\v 32 And the multitude of_the \add ones\add* having_believed, was one in_heart and soul, and and_not one anything of_the \add things\add* possessing to_him was_saying to_be \add his\add*_own, but was all \add things\add* in_common to_them.

\v 20 But Petros said to him: The silver of_you, it_might_be to destruction with you, because you_thought to_be_acquiring the gift of_ the _\nd god\nd* by money.
\v 21 There_is no portion nor allotment to_you in the this matter. For/Because the heart of_you not is right before the \nd god\nd*.
\v 22 Therefore repent of the this evil of_you, and be_besought of_the \nd master\nd* if perhaps the intention of_the heart of_you will_be_being_forgiven to_you.
\v 23 For/Because I_am_seeing you being in \add the\add*_gall of_bitterness and \add the\add*_bond of_unrighteousness.
\v 24 But the Simōn answering said: You_all Be_besought for me to the \nd master\nd*, so_that nothing of_which you_all_have_spoken may_come_over on me.
\v 25 Therefore they indeed, having_testified and having_spoken the message of_the \nd master\nd*, were_returning to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and they_were_evangelizing many villages of_the Samareitaʸs/(Shomrōn).

\v 31 And he said: For/Because how wishfully I_might_be_able if not someone will_be_guiding me? And he_appealed the to_Filippos having_gone_up to_sit_down with him.

\v 33 In the humiliation, the justice of_him was_taken_away, who will_be_describing the generation of_him? Because the life of_him is_being_taken_away from the earth.
\v 34 And the eunuch answering to_ the _Filippos said: I_am_beseeching of_you concerning whom the prophet is_saying this? Concerning himself or concerning someone other?
\v 35 And the Filippos having_opened_up the mouth of_him, and having_begun from the this scripture, he_good_message_preached the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* to_him.

\v 12 And the \nd spirit\nd* told to_me, to_come_together with_them, having_doubted nothing. And these the six brothers also came with me, and we_came_in into the house of_the man.
\v 13 He_reported and to_us how he_saw the messenger in the house of_him, having_been_stood and having_said: Send_out to Yoppaʸ, and send_for Simōn, the \add one\add* being_called Petros,

\v 17 Therefore if the \nd god\nd* gave the same gift to_them, as also to_us having_believed on the \nd master Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*, who was I powerful to_forbid the \nd god\nd*?

\v 11 And the Petros having_become to himself said: Now I_have_ truly _known that \nd master\nd* sent_away the messenger of_him, and rescued me out_of \add the\add*_hand of_Haʸrōdaʸs and all the expectation of_the people of_the Youdaiōns.
\v 12 And having_seen, he_came to the house of_ the _Maria/(Miryām), the mother of_Yōannaʸs, who \add is\add* being_called Markos, where many were having_been_convened_together and praying.
\v 13 And of_him having_knocked the door of_the gate, \add a\add*_servant_girl by_\add the\add*_name Ɽodaʸ approached to_answer.
\v 14 And having_recognized the voice of_ the _Petros, from the joy she_ not _opened_up the gate, but having_run_in she_reported the Petros to_have_stood before the gate.
\v 15 And they to her said: You_are_raving_mad. But she was_insisting to_be_having thus. And they were_saying: It_is the messenger of_him.
\v 16 But the Petros was_continuing_on knocking, and having_opened_up \add it\add* they_saw him, and they_marvelled.
\v 17 But having_gestured to_them with_his hand to_be_keeping_silent, he_described to_them how the \nd master\nd* led_ him _out from the prison. And he_said: Report these \add things\add* to_Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ) and to_the brothers. And having_come_out, he_was_gone to another place.
\v 18 And having_become day, there_was no little disturbance among the soldiers, what consequently became the Petros.
\v 19 And Haʸrōdaʸs having_sought_after him and not having_found \add him\add*, having_examined the guards, commanded \add them\add* to_be_led_away \add to_death\add*. And having_come_down from the Youdaia to Kaisareia, he_was_staying.
\v 20 And he_was raging with_\add the\add*_Turos/(Tsor) and Sidōn/(Tsīdōn)ians, and with_one_accord they_were_coming to him, and having_persuaded Blastos, who \add was\add* over the bedchamber of_the king, they_were_requesting peace, because_of that the region of_them to_be_being_nourished by the royal.

\v 24 But the message of_the of_\nd god\nd* was_growing and was_being_multiplied.
\v 25 And Barnabas and Saulos/(Shāʼūl) returned to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), having_fulfilled the service, having_taken_along_with \add them\add* Yōannaʸs, which having_been_called Markos.

\v 13 And the \add ones\add* around \add him\add* Paulos having_been_launched from the Pafos, came to Pergaʸ of_ the _Pamfulia. But Yōannaʸs having_went_away from them, he_returned to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim).

\v 15 And after the public_reading of_the law and of_the prophets, the synagogue_leaders sent_out to them saying: Men, brothers, if among you_all there_is any message of_exhortation toward the people, be_speaking \add it\add*.
\v 16 And Paulos having_stood_up, and having_gestured with_his hand said: Men, \add ones\add*_from_Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*), and you_all revering the \nd god\nd*, hear \add me\add*.
\v 17 The \nd god\nd* of_the people of_this Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*) chose the fathers of_us, and exalted the people in the sojourn in \add the\add*_land of_Aiguptos/(Miʦrayim), and with \add his\add*_arm high, he_led_out them out_of it,

\v 21 And_from_there they_requested \add a\add*_king, and the \nd god\nd* gave to_them the Saulos/(Shāʼūl), son of_Kis/(Qīsh), \add a\add*_man of \add the\add*_tribe of_Beniamin/(Binyāmīn), for_ forty _years.
\v 22 And having_removed him, he_raised the Dawid/(Dāvid) to_them for \add a\add*_king, to_whom also he_spoke having_testified: I_found Dawid the \add son\add* of_ the _Yessai/(Yishay): \add a\add*_man according_to the heart of_me, who will_be_doing all the wills of_me.
\v 23 Of the seed of_this \add one\add* the \nd god\nd* according_to promise, brought to_ the _Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*) \add a\add*_saviour, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*,

\v 26 Men, brothers, sons of_\add the\add*_descent of_Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām), and you_all among you_all revering the \nd god\nd*, to_us the message of_ the this _salvation was_sent_away.
\v 27 For/Because the \add ones\add* dwelling in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) and the rulers of_them, having_not_known this \add one\add* and the voices of_the prophets, who being_read on every day_of_rest, having_judged \add him\add* they_fulfilled \add them\add*.
\v 28 And having_found not_one cause for_death, they_requested Pilatos him to_be_killed.

\v 32 And we are_good_message_preaching to_you_all the the promise having_become to fathers,
\v 33 that the \nd god\nd* has_fulfilled this to_the children of_us, having_raised_up \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, as also in the the second psalm it_has_been_written: you are son of_me, today I have_bore you.
\v 34 And that raised_ him _up from \add the\add*_dead, no_longer going to_be_returning to decay, thus he_has_said, that I_will_be_giving to_you_all the devout the faithful of_Dawid/(Dāvid).
\v 35 Therefore also in another \add psalm\add* he_is_saying: You_˓will˒_ not _be_giving the devout \add one\add* of_you to_see decay.
\v 36 For/Because on_one_hand Dawid having_attended to_the the counsel of_\nd god\nd* to_\add his\add*_own generation, was_fallen_asleep and was_added to the fathers of_him, and saw decay.
\v 37 On_the_other_hand which \add one\add* the \nd god\nd* raised not saw decay.
\v 38 Therefore it_let_be known, to_you_all, men, brothers, that through this \add one\add*, forgiveness of_sins is_being_proclaimed to_you_all, and from all \add things\add* of_which you_all_were_ not _able to_be_justified in \add the\add*_law of_Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh),
\v 39 everyone which believing in this \add one\add* is_being_justified.
\v 40 Therefore be_watching_out, lest the \add message\add* having_been_said in the prophets may_come_over:
\v 41 Watch, the scoffers, and wonder and be_perishing, because I am_doing \add a\add*_work in the days of_you_all, \add a\add*_work which by_no_means you_all_may_ not _believe, if someone may_be_describing_in_detail \add it\add* to_you_all.
\v 42 And of_them departing, they_were_imploring these the messages to_be_spoken to_them on the afterward day_of_rest.
\v 43 And having_been_released of_the synagogue, many of_the Youdaiōns and of_the worshipping converts followed the after_Paulos and the Barnabas, who addressing to_them, were_persuading them to_be_remaining in_the grace of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 44 And on_the coming day_of_rest, almost all the city was_gathered_together to_hear the message of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 45 But the Youdaiōns having_seen the crowds, they_were_filled with_jealousy and they_were_speaking_against against_the_ slandering _\add things\add* being_spoken by Paulos.
\v 46 and, the Paulos and the Barnabas Having_spoken_boldly said, it_was necessary the message of_ the _\nd god\nd* first to_be_spoken To_you_all. Since and you_all_are_pushing_ it _away, and not worthy you_all_are_judging yourselves of_ the _eternal life, see, we_are_being_turned to the pagans.
\v 47 For/Because thus the \nd master\nd* has_commanded to_us: I_have_set you for \add a\add*_light of_\add the\add*_pagans, which you to_be for salvation to \add the\add*_last of_the earth.
\v 48 And hearing \add it\add* the pagans, they_were_rejoicing and were_glorifying the message of_the \nd master\nd*, and as_many_as were having_been_appointed to eternal life believed.
\v 49 And the message of_the \nd master\nd* was_being_carried_through through all the region.
\v 50 But the Youdaiōns incited the the prominent worshipping women, and the leaders of_the city, and they_stirred_up \add a\add*_persecution against the Paulos and Barnabas, and they_throw_ them _out from the regions of_them.
\v 51 But they, having_shaken_off the dust of_the feet against them, came to Ikonion.
\v 52 And the apprentices/followers were_being_filled with_joy and \add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*.
\c 14

\v 1 And it_became, in Ikonion with the same them to_come_in into the synagogue of_the Youdaiōns, and to_speak thus so_that \add a\add*_great multitude of_ both _Youdaiōns and Hellaʸns to_believe.
\v 2 But the Youdaiōns having_disbelieved stirred_up and mistreated the hearts of_the pagans against the brothers.
\v 3 Therefore on_one_hand they_stayed much time, speaking_boldly for the \nd master\nd*, the \add one\add* testifying the message of_the grace of_him, to_giving signs and wonders to_be_becoming through the hands of_them.
\v 4 On_the_other_hand the multitude of_the city was_divided, and on_one_hand they were with the Youdaiōns, on_the_other_hand they with the ambassadors.
\v 5 And when \add an\add*_impulse both of_the pagans and Youdaiōns with the rulers of_them became, to_mistreat and to_throw_stones at_them,
\v 6 having_seen, they_fled_down to the cities of_ the _Lukaonia, Lustra, and Derbaʸ, and the surrounding_region,
\v 7 and_there they_were good_message_preaching.
\v 8 And \add a\add*_certain man, in Lustra powerless by_the feet, who never walked was_sitting lame from \add the\add*_womb of_\add the\add*_mother of_him.
\v 9 This \add man\add* was_hearing of_ the _Paulos speaking, who having_looked_intently at_him and having_seen that he_is_having faith which to_be_healed,
\v 10 said with_\add a\add*_loud voice: Stand_up straight on the feet of_you. And he_sprang_up and was_walking.
\v 11 And the crowds having_seen what Paulos did, lifted_up the voice of_them In_Lukaonian saying: The gods having_been_likened to_men, came_down to us.
\v 12 They_were_calling both the Barnabas: Zeus, and the Paulos: Hermas, since he was the \add one\add* leading of_the matter.
\v 13 And the \add the\add*_priest of_ the _Zeus, which being before the city, having_brought bulls and garlands to the gates, he_was_wanting to_be_sacrificing with the crowds.
\v 14 But the ambassadors Barnabas and Paulos having_heard, having_torn the robes of_themselves, they_rushed_out into the crowd, crying_out
\v 15 and saying: Men, why are_you_all_doing these \add things\add*? We also are humans like_natured with_you_all, evangelizing you_all to_be_turning_back from these the useless \add things\add* to living \nd god\nd*: who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the \add things\add* in them.
\v 16 Who in the generations having_gone_by, allowed all the nations to_be_going to_the ways of_them.
\v 17 And_yet left himself not without_witness, working_good from_heaven to_you_all giving rains and fruitful seasons, filling with_food and the hearts of_you_all gladness.
\v 18 And saying these \add things\add*, with_difficulty they_restrained the crowds which not to_be_sacrificing to_them.
\v 19 But Youdaiōns Came_over from Antioⱪeia and Ikonion, and having_persuaded the crowds, and having_stoned the Paulos, they_were_dragging \add him\add* outside the city, thinking him to_have_died.
\v 20 But of_the apprentices/followers having_surrounded him, having_stood_up he_came_in into the city. And on_the \add day\add* of_next he_came_out with the Barnabas to Derbaʸ.
\v 21 And having_good_message_preached the that city, and having_trained many, they_returned to the Lustra, and to Ikonion, and to Antioⱪeia,
\v 22 strengthening the souls of_the apprentices/followers, exhorting \add them\add* to_be_remaining_in in_the faith, and that it_is_fitting us to_come_in into the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* through many tribulations.
\v 23 And having_chosen elders for_them in assembly, having_prayed with fastings, they_entrusted them to_the \nd master\nd* on whom they_had_believed.
\v 24 And having_passed_through the Pisidia, they_came to the Pamfulia,
\v 25 and having_spoken the message in Pergaʸ, they_came_down to Attalia,
\v 26 and_from_there they_sailed_away to Antioⱪeia, whence they_were having_been_given_over to_the grace of_ the _\nd god\nd*, because/for the work that they_fulfilled.
\v 27 And having_arrived and having_gathered_together the assembly, they_were_declaring as_much_as the \nd god\nd* did with them, and that he_opened_up \add a\add*_door of_faith to_the pagans.

\v 1 And some having_come_down from the Youdaia, were_teaching the brothers, that If you_all_may_ not _be_circumcised to_the custom which of_Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh), you_all_are_ not _being_able to_be_saved.
\v 2 And dissension and no little debate having_become the by_Paulos and the Barnabas with them, they_determined Paulos and Barnabas and some others from them to_be_going_up, to the ambassadors and elders in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) about the this question.
\v 3 therefore indeed The having_been_sent_forward by the assembly, they_were_passing_through the both Foinikaʸ and Samareia/(Shomrōn), describing_in_detail the conversion of_the pagans, and they_were_producing great joy to_all the brothers.
\v 4 And having_arrived in Hierousalaʸm, they_were_accepted by the assembly, and the ambassadors, and the elders, and they_declared as_much_as the \nd god\nd* did with them.
\v 5 But some of_the \add ones\add* of the sect of_the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_believed rose_up, saying, that It_is_fitting to_be_circumcising them, and to_be_commanding \add them\add* to_be_keeping the law of_Mōsaʸs.
\v 6 And the ambassadors and the elders were_gathered_together, to_see about the this matter.
\v 7 And having_become much debate, Petros having_stood_up said to them: Men, brothers, you_all are_knowing that from ancient days among you_all, the \nd god\nd* chose for_the pagans to_hear by the mouth of_me, the message of_the good_message and to_believe.
\v 8 And \nd god\nd* the heart_knower testified to_them, having_given \add them\add* the the holy \nd spirit\nd* as also to_us,

\v 10 Therefore now why are_you_all_testing the \nd god\nd*, to_put_on \add a\add*_yoke on the neck of_the apprentices/followers, that neither the fathers of_us nor we were_able to_bear?
\v 11 But by the grace of_the \add the\add*_\nd master Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, we_are_believing to_be_saved also_those in which manner.
\v 12 And all the multitude kept_silent, and they_were_hearing from_Barnabas and Paulos, explaining as_much_as the \nd god\nd* did, signs and wonders among the pagans by them.
\v 13 And after which them to_keep_silent, Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ) answered saying: Men, brothers, hear from_me.
\v 14 Sumeōn/(Shimˊōn) explained as first the \nd god\nd* visited, to_take out_of \add the\add*_pagans \add a\add*_people for_the name of_him.
\v 15 And with_this are_agreeing_together the messages of_the prophets as it_has_been_written,
\v 16 After these \add things\add* I_will_be_returning and I_will_be_rebuilding_up the tent of_Dawid/(Dāvid) which having_fallen, and of_it which having_been_overturned, I_will_be_rebuilding_up and I_will_be_restoring it,
\v 17 so_that wishfully the remnant of_the people may_seek_out the \nd master\nd*, also all the pagans, on whom has_been_called the name of_me on them, is_saying \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* doing these \add things\add*,
\v 18 known from eternity.
\v 19 Therefore I am_judging to_ not _be_troubling to_the \add ones\add* from the pagans, turning_back to the \nd god\nd*,
\v 20 but to_write to_them which to_be_keeping_away from_the pollutions of_ the _idols, and the sexual_immorality, and the strangled \add animal\add*, and the blood.
\v 21 For/Because Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) from ancient generations in_every city the \add ones\add* proclaiming him, is_having being_read in the synagogues on every day_of_rest.
\v 22 Then it_supposed to_the ambassadors and the elders with all the assembly, having_chosen men from them, to_send \add them\add* to Antioⱪeia with the Paulos and Barnabas, Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) which being_called Barsabbas and Silas, leading men among the brothers,

\v 24 Since we_heard that some from us to_whom we_ not _instructed having_come_out, disturbed you_all by_ upsetting _messages the hearts of_you_all,
\v 25 it_supposed to_us having_become with_one_accord, having_chosen men to_send to you_all, with Barnabas and Paulos the beloved of_us,
\v 26 men having_given_over the lives of_them for the name of_the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 27 Therefore we_have_sent_out Youdas and Silas, and them reporting the same \add things\add* by message.
\v 28 For/Because it_supposed to_the the holy \nd spirit\nd* and to_us, nothing more burden to_be_being_laid_on on_you_all, except which necessarily these \add things\add*:
\v 29 to_be_keeping_away from_idol_sacrificed \add things\add*, and from_blood, and from_strangled \add animals\add*, and from_sexual_immorality, from which keeping yourselves, you_all_will_be_doing well. Stay_strong. 
\v 30 Therefore indeed they having_been_sent_away, came_down to Antioⱪeia, and having_gathered_together the multitude, they_handed_out the letter.

\v 35 But Paulos and Barnabas were_staying in Antioⱪeia, teaching and good_message_preaching the message of_the \nd master\nd* with many others also.
\v 36 And after some days, Paulos said to Barnabas, indeed having_turned_back we_may_visit the brothers in every city, in which we_proclaimed the message of_the \nd master\nd*, how they_are_having.

\v 39 And \add a\add*_provocation became, so_as them to_be_separated from one_another, and the Barnabas having_taken the Markos, to_sail_away to Kupros.
\v 40 But Paulos having_chosen Silas, came_out having_been_given_over to_the grace of_the \nd master\nd* by the brothers.

\v 1 And he_arrived also to Derbaʸ and to Lustra. And see, \add a\add*_ certain _apprentice/follower was there by_\add the\add*_name Timotheos, \add the\add*_son of_\add a\add*_ believing _woman Youdaiōns, but \add his\add*_father \add was\add* of_\add a\add*_Hellaʸn,

\v 3 The Paulos wanted this \add one\add* to_come_out with him, and having_taken he_circumcised him, because_of the Youdaiōns which being in the those places, because/for all had_known that the father of_him he_was_being \add a\add*_Hellaʸn.
\v 4 And while they_were_passing_through the cities, they_were_giving_over to_them the decrees to_be_keeping which having_been_judged by of_the ambassadors and elders which in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim).

\v 10 And when he_saw the vision, immediately we_sought to_come_out to Makedonia, concluding that the \nd god\nd* has_called_to us to_evangelize them.

\v 18 And she_was_doing this for many days. But Paulos having_been_thoroughly_disturbed, and having_turned_back by_the spirit said: I_am_commanding to_you in \add the\add*_name of_\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd* to_come_out from her. And it_came_out to_ the _same hour.

\v 20 and having_brought_ them _forward to_the officers, they_said: These the men being Youdaiōns are_disturbing the city of_us,

\v 28 But Paulos called with_\add a\add*_ loud _voice saying: You_may_do nothing harm to_yourself, because/for we_are all here.
\v 29 And having_requested lights, he_rushed_in, and having_become trembling, he_fell_before to_ the _Paulos and Silas.
\v 30 And having_brought_ them _forth out was_saying: Masters, what is_fitting me to_be_doing, in_order_that I_may_be_saved?
\v 31 And they said: Believe in the \nd master Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* and you_will_be_being_saved, you and the household of_you.
\v 32 And they_spoke the message of_the \nd master\nd* to_him, with all the \add ones\add* in the house of_him.

\v 35 And having_become day, the officers sent_out the policemen saying: Send_away the those men.
\v 36 And the prison_guard reported the messages to the Paulos: that The officers ˓Have˒_sent_out, in_order_that you_all_may_be_sent_away. Therefore now having_come_out, be_going in peace.
\v 37 But the Paulos was_saying to them: Having_beat us with_publicly, uncondemned men being Ɽōmaios, they_throw \add us\add* into prison and now secretly they_are_throwing_ us _out? For/Because no, but having_come themselves, them_let_lead_ us _out.
\v 38 And the policemen reported the these messages to_the officers. And they_were_afraid having_heard that they_are Ɽōmaios.

\v 1 And having_travelled_through the Amfipolis and the Apollōnia, they_came to Thessalonikaʸ, where was \add a\add*_synagogue of_the Youdaiōns.
\v 2 And according_to the \add way\add* having_been_accustomed the with_Paulos, he_came_in to them, and for Three days_of_rest, he_discussed with_them from the scriptures,

\v 4 And some of them were_persuaded and they_were_joined the with_Paulos and the Silas, both \add a\add*_ great _multitude of_the \add ones\add* Hellaʸns worshipping, and leading \add a\add*_few women the not.
\v 5 But the Youdaiōns, having_been_jealous and having_taken_aside some evil men of_the marketplaces, and having_formed_a_mob, they_were_distressing the city, and having_approached to_the house of_Yasōn, they_were_seeking them to_bring_forth to the public.
\v 6 And not having_found them, they_were_dragging Yasōn and some brothers before the city_council shouting, that The \add ones\add* having_upset the inhabited_world, these are_coming here also,
\v 7 whom Yasōn has_welcomed, and these all are_doing in_front_of the decrees of_Kaisar, saying \nd Yaʸsous\nd* another king to_be.
\v 8 And they_disturbed the crowd and the city_council hearing these \add things\add*.
\v 9 And having_taken the much from the Yasōn and the rest, they_sent_ them _away.
\v 10 And the brothers immediately sent_out the both Paulos and the Silas by night to Beroia, who having_arrived, were_going into the synagogue of_the Youdaiōns.
\v 11 And these were more_noble \add than\add* the \add ones\add* in Thessalonikaʸ, who received the message with all readiness, in_every day examining the scriptures, if these \add things\add* might_be_having thus.
\v 12 therefore indeed Many from them believed, and not \add a\add*_few of_the the prominent Hellaʸn women, and men.
\v 13 But when the Youdaiōns from the Thessalonikaʸ knew that also the message of_ the _\nd god\nd* was_proclaimed by the Paulos in, the Beroia, they_came also_there, agitating and disturbing the crowds.
\v 14 And then the brothers immediately the Paulos sent_away, to_be_going as_far_as to the sea, and the both Silas and the Timotheos remained there.
\v 15 And the \add ones\add* appointing the Paulos, brought \add him\add* to Athaʸnai, and having_received \add a\add*_command for the Silas and the Timotheos, that as they_may_come most_quickly to him, they_were_departing.
\v 16 And the Paulos in the Athaʸnai, of_awaiting them, the spirit of_him was_being_provoked in him, of_observing the city being idolatrous.
\v 17 Therefore he_was_discussing on_one_hand in the synagogue with_the Youdaiōns, and the \add ones\add* worshipping, and in the marketplace on every day with the \add ones\add* happening_to_be.
\v 18 On_the_other_hand some also of_the Epikoureios and Stōikos philosophers were_conferring with_him, and some were_saying: What wishfully might_ this - _be_wanting babbler to_be_saying?

\v 19 and having_taken_hold of_him, they_brought \add him\add* to the Areios Hill saying: Are_we_being_able to_know what \add is\add* the this new, teaching \add is\add* which being_spoken by you?
\v 20 For/Because you_are_carrying_in some_ surprising _\add messages\add* to the ears of_us. Therefore we_are_wishing to_know what_all is_wanting these \add things\add* to_be.
\v 21 (And all \add the\add*_\add ones\add*_from_Athaʸnai and the visiting strangers were_having_opportunity in not_one other \add thing\add*, than to_be_telling something or to_be_hearing some newer \add thing\add*.)
\v 22 And Paulos having_been_stood in \add the\add*_midst of_the Areios Hill was_saying: Men, \add ones\add*_from_Athaʸnai, I_am_perceiving in all \add things\add* how more_superstitious you_all.
\v 23 For/Because passing_through and observing the objects_of_worship of_you_all, I_ even _found \add an\add*_altar on which had_been_inscribed: To_\add an\add*_unknown \nd god\nd*. Therefore you_all_are_being_devout not_knowing which, this \add thing\add* I am_proclaiming to_you_all.
\v 24 The \nd god\nd* which having_made the earth and all the \add things\add* in it, this \add one\add* being \nd master\nd* of_heaven and earth, is_dwelling neither in handmade temples,

\v 27 to_be_seeking the \nd god\nd*, if perhaps surely they_might_grope for_him and might_find \add him\add*, also surely being not far from one each of_us.
\v 28 For/Because we_are_living in him and are_being_moved and are, as also some of_the among you_all of_\add the\add*_poets have_said: For/Because we_are also of_the \add one\add* descent.
\v 29 Therefore being descent of_ the _\nd god\nd*, we_ought not to_be_thinking about_gold or silver or \add a\add*_stone mark of_\add the\add*_craft and thoughts of_human_origin, to_be similar the divine.
\v 30 Therefore indeed the \nd god\nd* the times of_ the _ignorance having_overlooked, now he_is_reporting the \add things\add* to_ all _the people everywhere to_be_repenting,
\v 31 as_much_as he_set \add a\add*_day in which he_is_going to_be_judging the inhabited_world in righteousness, by \add a\add*_man to_whom he_designated, having_brought_about faith to_all, having_raised_ him _up from \add the\add*_dead.
\v 32 And having_heard \add about\add* \add a\add*_resurrection of_\add the\add*_dead, on_one_hand they were_mocking, on_the_other_hand they said: We_will_be_hearing from_you concerning this also again.

\v 14 But the Paulos going to_be_opening_up his mouth, the Galliōn said to the Youdaiōns: If on_one_hand it_was \add a\add*_certain wrong or evil crime, Oh Youdaiōns, according_to \add the\add*_matter wishfully I_had_tolerated of_you_all,

\v 18 And the Paulos having_remained many days still, having_bid_goodbye to_the brothers, was_sailing_away to the Suria/(ʼArām), and with him Priskilla and Akulas, having_shaved his head in Kegⱪreai, because/for he_was_having \add a\add*_vow.

\v 33 And out_of the crowd they_concluded Alexandros, of_the Youdaiōns having_put_ him _forward. And the Alexandros having_gestured his hand, was_wanting to_be_defending to_the public.
\v 34 But having_recognized that he_is \add a\add*_Youdaios, cry there_became one from all, over about two hours crying_out: Great the Artemis of_\add the\add*_\add ones\add*_from_Efesos. 
\v 35 And the clerk having_calmed the crowd is_saying: Men, \add ones\add*_from_Efesos, because/for who is of_\add the\add*_people, who is_ not _knowing the city of_\add the\add*_\add ones\add*_from_Efesos being temple_keeper of_the great Artemis and of_the fallen_from_Zeus \add image\add*?
\v 36 Therefore these \add things\add* being unquestionable, it_is fitting you_all to_be_being having_been_calmed, and to_be_doing nothing reckless.
\v 37 For/Because you_all_brought the these men, neither temple-robbers nor slandering the goddess of_us.
\v 38 If therefore on_one_hand Daʸmaʸtrios and the craftsmen with him are_having \add a\add*_matter against anyone, courts are_being_brought and there_are proconsuls, let_them_be_indicting against_one_another.
\v 39 On_the_other_hand if you_all_are_seeking_after anything concerning others, it_will_be_being_settled in the lawful assembly.
\v 40 For/Because we_ also _are_risking_danger to_be_being_indicted of_insurrection concerning the \add day\add* today, nothing being cause, concerning which we_˓will˒_ not _be_able to_give_back \add a\add*_account concerning the this disorderly_gathering.

\v 1 And after the \add time\add* the commotion to_cease, the Paulos having_sent_for the apprentices/followers and having_greeted having_exhorted, he_came_out to_be_going to Makedonia.
\v 2 And having_passed_through the those districts, and having_exhorted them with_ much _speech, he_came to the Hellas.

\v 5 And these having_approached were_remaining with_us in Trōias.
\v 6 And we sailed_away from Filippou after the days of_ the _non-fermented \add bread\add*, and until five days came to them at the Trōias, where we_stayed seven days.
\v 7 And on the first \add day\add* of_the week, us having_been_gathered_together to_break bread, the Paulos was_discussing with_them, going to_be_departing on_the \add day\add* of_next, and was_prolonging the speech until midnight.
\v 8 And there_were many lamps in the upper_room, where we_were having_been_gathered_together.
\v 9 And \add a\add*_certain young_man by_\add the\add*_name Eutuⱪos sitting by the window, being_overcome by_ deep _sleep, the as_ Paulos _discussing on more, having_been_overcome by the sleep, he_fell down from the third_story, and was_taken_up dead.
\v 10 But having_come_down, the Paulos fell_on on_him and having_embraced \add him\add* said: Be_ not _being_distressed, because/for the life of_him is in him.
\v 11 And having_gone_up, and having_broke the bread and having_tasted \add it\add*, and for having_ much _conversed until daybreak, thus he_came_out.
\v 12 And they_brought the boy living, and were_comforted not moderately.
\v 13 But we, having_approached to the ship, were_launched to the Assos, from_there going to_be_taking_up the Paulos, because/for thus having_been_directed, he_ himself _was going to_be_going_on_foot.
\v 14 And when he_was_encountering with_us in the Assos, having_taken_ him _up, we_came to Mitulaʸnaʸ.
\v 15 And_from_there having_sailed_away, on_the_ following _\add day\add* we_arrived opposite Ⱪios, and on_the next \add day\add* we_arrived in Samos, and on_the_ following _\add day\add* we_came to Milaʸtos.
\v 16 For/Because the Paulos had_judged to_sail_past the Efesos, so_that may_ not _become to_him to_spend_time in the Asia, because/for he_was_hurrying if possible it_might_be to_him, the day of_ the _pentecost to_become in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim).
\v 17 And from the Milaʸtos, having_sent to Efesos, he_summoned the elders of_the assembly.
\v 18 And when they_arrived to him, he_said to_them: You_all are_knowing from \add the\add*_first day from which I_set_foot_in in the Asia, how I_became with you_all the whole time,
\v 19 serving for_the \nd master\nd* with all humility, and tears, and trials, in the plots of_the Youdaiōns which having_happened, to_me, 
\v 20 how I_shrunk_back nothing of_the_ benefitting _\add things\add* which to_ not _declare to_you_all, and to_teach you_all with_publicly and in \add all\add* homes,
\v 21 testifying to_ both _Youdaiōns and to_Hellaʸns, which repentance toward \nd god\nd* and faith toward the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*. \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 22 And now see, I having_been_bound by_the \nd spirit\nd*, am_going to Hierousalaʸm, not having_known the \add things\add* in it going_to_be_meeting with_me.
\v 23 except that the the holy \nd spirit\nd* in_every city is_testifying to_me, saying that bonds and tribulations are_remaining me.
\v 24 But of_nothing account I_am_making the life precious to_myself, so_as I_may_complete the course of_me, and the service which I_received from the \nd master Yaʸsous\nd*, to_testify the good_message of_the grace of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 25 And now see, I have_known that you_all all among whom I_passed_through proclaiming the kingdom. ˓will˒_ no_longer _be_seeing. the face of_me.
\v 26 Therefore I_am_testifying to_you_all in the today day that I_am pure from the blood of_all,
\v 27 for/because I_ not _shrunk_back which to_ not _declare all the counsel of_ the _\nd god\nd* to_you_all.
\v 28 Be_taking_heed to_yourselves and to_all the flock, among which the the holy \nd spirit\nd* set you_all overseers, to_be_shepherding the assembly of_the of_\nd god\nd*, which he_procured through his his own blood.
\v 29 I have_known that after the departure of_me heavy wolves will_be_coming_in among you_all, not sparing from_the flock,
\v 30 and from of_you_all yourselves men will_be_rising_up speaking having_been_perverted \add things\add*, of_the \add thing\add* to_be_drawing_out the apprentices/followers after themselves.
\v 31 Therefore be_watching, remembering that night and day for_three_year, I_ not _ceased admonishing each one with tears.
\v 32 And now the \add things\add* I_am_entrusting you_all to_ the _\nd god\nd*, and to_the message of_the grace of_him, which being_able to_build and to_give the \add an\add*_inheritance among all the \add ones\add* having_been_sanctified.
\v 33 I_coveted of_silver, or gold, or clothing, of_no_one.
\v 34 you_all_ yourselves _are_knowing that these the hands attended to_the needs of_me and to_the \add ones\add* being with me.
\v 35 all \add things\add* I_showed to_you_all that thus labouring it_is_fitting to_be_taking_care of_the \add ones\add* faltering, and to_be_remembering about_the messages of_the \nd master Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* that he said: it_is more Blessed, to_be_giving than to_be_receiving.
\v 36 And having_said these \add things\add*, having_knelt the knees of_him, he_prayed with them all.
\v 37 And much weeping became of_all, and having_embraced on the neck of_ the _Paulos, they_were_kissing him,

\v 1 And when it_became us to_be_launched, having_been_withdrawn from them, having_run_straight we_came to the Kōs, and on_the_ next _\add day\add* to the Ɽodos, and_from_there to Patara.
\v 2 And having_found \add a\add*_ship crossing_over into Foinikaʸ, having_boarded we_were_launched.

\v 4 And having_sought_out the apprentices/followers, we_remained_on there seven days, who were_saying by the \nd spirit\nd* to_ the _Paulos not to_be_setting_foot_in to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim).
\v 5 And when it_became to_us to_finish_out the days, having_come_out we_were_journeying, wives and children accompanying with us all, as_far_as outside the city, and having_knelt the knees on the shore having_prayed,
\v 6 we_withdrew from_one_another and we_went_up into the ship, and those returned to their own \add homes\add*.
\v 7 And we, having_completed the voyage from Turos, arrived to Ptolemais, and having_greeted the brothers, we_remained one day with them.

\v 9 And with_this \add man\add* were four daughters, virgins prophesying.
\v 10 And remaining_on more days, \add a\add*_certain prophet by_\add the\add*_name Agabos came_down from the Youdaia,
\v 11 and having_come to us, and having_taken_up the belt of_ the _Paulos, having_bound of_himself the feet and the hands, he_said: The the holy \nd spirit\nd* is_saying these \add things\add*: The man of_whom is the this belt, thus the Youdaiōns in Hierousalaʸm will_be_binding, and they_will_be_giving_over \add him\add* into \add the\add*_hands of_\add the\add*_pagans.
\v 12 And when we_heard these \add things\add*, both we and the of_\add the\add*_locals were_imploring, which him not to_be_going_up to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim).
\v 13 Then the Paulos answered: What are_you_all_doing, weeping and breaking the heart of_me? For/Because I I_am_having ready not only to_be_bound, but also to_die_off in Hierousalaʸm, because/for the name of_the \nd master Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 14 And him not being_persuaded, we_kept_quiet having_said: The will of_the \nd master\nd* let_be_becoming.
\v 15 And after the these days, having_made_preparations, we_were_going_up to Hierousalaʸm.
\v 16 And also of_the apprentices/followers from Kaisareia came_together with us, bringing \add us\add* to_Mnasōn \add a\add*_certain ancient from_Kupros apprentice/follower with whom we_may_be_lodged.
\v 17 And of_us having_become at Hierousalaʸm, the brothers gladly welcomed us.
\v 18 and on_the \add day\add* following, the Paulos was_entering with us to Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), and all the elders arrived.
\v 19 And having_greeted them, he_was_explaining by each one, of_what the \nd god\nd* did among the pagans by the service of_him.
\v 20 And they having_heard were_glorifying the \nd god\nd*, and they_said to_him: You_are_observing, brother, how_many tens_of_thousands are among the Youdaiōns which having_believed, and they_are_ all _being zealous for_the law.
\v 21 And they_were_instructed concerning you, that you_are_teaching apostasy from Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) all Youdaiōns the \add ones\add* among the pagans, saying them not to_be_circumcising their children, nor to_be_walking in_the customs.
\v 22 Therefore what is_it? Certainly they_will_be_hearing that you_have_come.
\v 23 Therefore do this, what we_are_saying to_you. Four Men are with_us, having \add a\add*_vow for themselves.
\v 24 Having_taken these \add men\add*, be_purified with them and spend for them, in_order_that they_will_be_shaving his head, and all will_be_knowing that of_which they_have_been_instructed about you nothing is, but you_are_aligning also yourself, keeping the law.
\v 25 But concerning the pagans having_believed, we sent_out having_judged them to_be_keeping, from_the and/both idol_sacrificed \add thing\add*, and blood, and strangled \add animals\add*, and sexual_immorality.
\v 26 Then the Paulos having_taken the men, on_the following day with them having_been_purified, was_entering into the temple, proclaiming the fulfillment of_the days of_the purification, until of_which the offering was_offered for each one of_them.
\v 27 And when the seven days were_going, to_be_being_completed, the Youdaiōns from the Asia, having_seen him in the temple, were_confounding all the crowd, and they_laid_on their hands on him
\v 28 crying_out: Men, \add ones\add*_from_Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*), be_giving_help. This is the man, who teaching all everywhere against the people, and the law, and the this place, and still also brought_in Hellaʸns into the temple, and has_defiled the this holy place.
\v 29 For/Because they_were having_previously_seen Trofimos the from_Efesos in the city with him, whom they_were_thinking that the Paulos brought_in into the temple.
\v 30 And the whole city was_stirred, and \add a\add*_rushing_together of_the people became, and having_taken_hold of_ the _Paulos, they_were_dragging him outside the temple, and immediately the doors were_shut.
\v 31 and seeking to_kill_ him _off, there_went_up \add an\add*_allegation to_the commander of_the cohort, that all Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) is_being_confounded,
\v 32 who immediately having_taken soldiers and centurions, ran_down on them, and which having_seen the commander and the soldiers, they_ceased striking the Paulos.
\v 33 Then having_neared, the commander took_hold of_him, and commanded \add him\add* to_be_bound with_ two _chains, and he_was_inquiring who he_might_be and what he_is having_done.
\v 34 But others, were_crying_out some other \add thing\add* in the crowd. And him not of_being_able to_know the certain \add thing\add* because_of the commotion, he_commanded him to_be_being_brought into the barracks.
\v 35 And when he_became to the stairs, it_happened him to_be_being_borne by the soldiers, because_of the force of_the crowd.
\v 36 For/Because the multitude of_the people was_following crying_out: Be_Taking_ him _away.
\v 37 And going to_be_being_brought_in into the barracks, the Paulos is_saying to_the commander: - is_it_permitting to_me to_say something to you? And he was_saying: You_are_knowing In_Hellaʸn?
\v 38 Consequently are you not the from_Aiguptos/(Miʦrayim), who before these the days, having_upset and having_led_out the four_thousand men of_the assassins into the wilderness?
\v 39 But the Paulos said: On_one_hand I am \add a\add*_Youdaiōns \add a\add*_man, from_Tarsos, of_ the _Kilikia, \add a\add*_citizen of_\add an\add*_ not _insignificant city. On_the_other_hand I_am_beseeching of_you, permit to_me to_speak to the people.
\v 40 And of_ him _having_permitted, the Paulos having_stood on the stairs, gestured with_his hand to_the people, and great silence having_become, he_called_out in_his Hebraios language saying,

\v 1 Men, brothers, and fathers, hear which to you_all now of_\add the\add*_defense of_me.
\v 2 (And having_heard that he_was_calling_out to_them in_the Hebraios language, they_brought_about more quietness.) And he_is_saying:
\v 3 I am \add a\add*_ Youdaiōns _man, having_been_born in Tarsos of_ the _Kilikia, but having_been_brought_up in the this city, before the feet of_Gamaliaʸl/(Gamlī\sup ʼēl\sup*), having_been_instructed according_to \add the\add*_exactness of_our ancestral law, being zealous the for_\nd god\nd*, as all you_all are today,

\v 5 as also the chief_priest is_testifying to_me and all the council_of_elders, from whom also having_received letters to the brothers, I_was_going to Damaskos/(Dammeseq), going_to_ also _bring the \add ones\add* being there, having_been_bound to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), in_order_that they_may_be_punished.
\v 6 But it_became to_me journeying, and nearing to_ the _Damaskos about midday, suddenly much light from the sky to_flash_around around me.
\v 7 And I_fell to the ground, and I_heard of_\add a\add*_voice saying to_me: Saulos/(Shāʼūl), Saulos, why are_you_persecuting me?
\v 8 And I answered: Who are_you, master? And he_said to me: I am \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* the from_Nazaret, whom you are_persecuting.
\v 9 And the \add ones\add* being with me, on_one_hand they_saw the light, on_the_other_hand they_ not _heard the voice of_the \add one\add* speaking to_me.
\v 10 And I_said What may_I_do, \nd master\nd*? And the \nd master\nd* said to me: Having_risen_up be_going to Damaskos, and_there will_be_being_spoken to_you concerning all \add things\add* that has_been_determined for_you to_do.
\v 11 But as I_was_ not _focusing_in because_of the glory of_that the light, being_led_by_hand by the \add ones\add* being_with with_me, I_came to Damaskos.
\v 12 And Ananias \add a\add*_certain devout man according_to the law, being_attested by all the Youdaiōns dwelling \add there\add*,
\v 13 having_come to me and having_stood_by, he_said to_me: Saulos, brother, receive_sight. And_I looked_up on him to_ the _same hour.
\v 14 And he said: The \nd god\nd* of_the fathers of_us appointed you to_know the will of_him, and to_see the righteous \add one\add*, and to_hear \add the\add*_voice out_of the mouth of_him.
\v 15 Because you_will_be \add a\add*_witness for_him to all people, of_what \add things\add* you_have_seen and heard.
\v 16 And now why are_you_waiting? Having_risen_up, immerse and wash_away the sins of_you, having_appealed to_the name of_him.
\v 17 And it_became to_me, having_returned to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and praying of_me in the temple, me to_become in \add a\add*_trance,
\v 18 and to_see him saying to_me: Hurry and come_out with quickness out_of Hierousalaʸm, because they_˓will˒_ not _be_accepting of_you \add the\add*_testimony concerning me.
\v 19 And_I said: \nd master\nd*, they are_knowing that I was imprisoning and beating in the synagogues, the \add ones\add* believing in you.
\v 20 And when the blood of_Stefanos the witness of_you, was_being_poured_out, I_ myself _was also having_stood_by, and consenting, and keeping the clothes of_the \add ones\add* killing him.
\v 21 And he_said to me: Be_going, because I will_be_sending_ you _away to far pagans.
\v 22 And they_were_hearing from_him until this the message, and they_lifted_up the voice of_them saying: Be_taking_away the such \add man\add* from the earth, because/for it_was_ not _befitting him to_be_living. 
\v 23 and them Crying_out, and throwing_down their clothes, and throwing dust into the air,
\v 24 the commander commanded him to_be_being_brought_in into the barracks, having_said him to_be_being_interrogated by_floggings, in_order_that he_may_know for what cause they_were_crying_out thus to_him.
\v 25 But as they_stretched_ him _out with_the straps, the Paulos said to the centurion having_stood, is_it_permitting to_you_all to_be_flogging if \add a\add*_man Ɽōmaios and uncondemned?
\v 26 And having_heard \add it\add* the centurion, having_approached to_the commander, he_reported saying: What are_you_going to_be_doing? For/Because the this man is \add a\add*_Ɽōmaios.
\v 27 And having_approached, the commander said to_him: Be_telling to_me, are you \add a\add*_Ɽōmaios? And he was_saying: Yes.
\v 28 and the commander answered: I this the acquired citizenship of_\add a\add*_great sum. But the Paulos was_saying: But I even have_been_born \add free\add*.
\v 29 Therefore the \add ones\add* going to_be_interrogating him immediately withdrew from him, the also and was_ commander _afraid, having_learned that he_is \add a\add*_Ɽōmaios, and because he_was having_bound him.
\v 30 But on_the \add day\add* of_next, wishing to_know the for_certain, which why he_is_being_accused by the Youdaiōns, he_released him, and commanded the chief_priests and all the council, to_come_together, and having_brought_down the Paulos, he_set \add him\add* among them.

\v 1 And the Paulos having_looked_intently at_the council said: Men, brothers, I in_all conscience have_lived_as_citizen good to_ the _\nd god\nd* until this the day.
\v 2 And Ananias the chief_priest commanded to_the \add ones\add* having_stood_by him, to_be_striking the mouth of_him.
\v 3 Then the Paulos said to him: - \nd god\nd* is_going to_be_striking you, wall having_been_whitewashed. And are_ you _sitting judging me according_to the law, and you_are_ violating_law _commanding me to_be_being_struck?
\v 4 But the \add ones\add* having_stood_by said: Are_you_insulting the chief_priest of_ the _\nd god\nd*?
\v 5 And the Paulos was_saying: I_had_ not _known, brothers, that he_is \add a\add*_chief_priest, because/for it_has_been_written, that you_˓will˒_ not _be_speaking wrongly \add A\add*_ruler of_the people of_you.
\v 6 But the Paulos having_known that the one part is of_Saddoukaios_\add sect\add*, but the \add the\add*_other of_Farisaios_\add party\add*, he_was_crying_out in the council: Men, brothers, I am \add a\add*_Farisaios_\add party_member\add*, \add the\add*_son of_Farisaios_\add party\add*, I am_being_judged concerning \add the\add*_hope and resurrection of_\add the\add*_dead.
\v 7 And of_him speaking this, \add a\add*_dissension became between_the Farisaios_\add party\add* and Saddoukaios_\add sect\add*, and the multitude was_divided.
\v 8 For/Because indeed \add the\add*_Saddoukaios_\add sect\add* are_saying to_be no resurrection, neither \add an\add*_messenger, nor \add a\add*_spirit, But \add the\add*_Farisaios_\add party\add* are_confessing which both.

\v 10 And becoming great, dissension, the commander having_been_afraid lest the Paulos may_be_torn_apart by them, commanded the army having_come_down, to_snatch him from midst of_them, and to_be_bringing \add him\add* into the barracks.
\v 11 But on_the following night, the \nd master\nd* having_approached to_him, said: Be_having_courage, because/for as you_testified the \add things\add* about me at Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), thus it_is_fitting you to_testify also at Ɽōmaʸ.
\v 12 And it_having_become day, the Youdaiōns having_made \add a\add*_disorderly_gathering, cursed themselves, saying neither to_eat nor to_drink, until of_which they_may_kill_off the Paulos.

\v 20 And he_said, that The Youdaiōns decided which to_ask you, so_that tomorrow you_may_bring_down the Paulos into the council, as going to_be_inquiring something more_exactly concerning him.
\v 21 Therefore you may_ not _be_persuaded by_them, because/for forty of them men more are_lying_in_wait him, who cursed themselves neither to_eat nor to_drink, until of_which they_may_kill him, and now they_are ready, waiting_for the promise from you.
\v 22 Therefore indeed the commander sent_away the young_man having_commanded: To_tell to_no_one that you_reported these \add things\add* to me.
\v 23 And having_called_to some two of_the centurions, he_said: Prepare two_hundred soldiers, so_that may_be_gone as_far_as Kaisareia, and seventy horsemen, and two_hundred spearmen for \add the\add*_third hour of_the night.
\v 24 And mounts to_present, in_order_that having_mounted the Paulos, they_may_bring_safely_through \add him\add* to Faʸlix the governor,
\v 25 having_written \add a\add*_letter, having the this pattern:
\v 26 Klaudios Lusias, to_be_greeting to_the most_excellent governor Faʸlix.
\v 27 The this man having_been_captured by the Youdaiōns, and going to_be_being_killed by them, having_approached with their army, I_rescued \add him\add* having_learned that he_is \add a\add*_Ɽōmaios.
\v 28 And wishing to_know the charge because_of which they_were_indicting against_him, I_brought_down \add him\add* to the council of_them.
\v 29 Whom I_found being_indicted concerning questions of_the law of_them, but nothing having indictment worthy of_death or of_bonds.
\v 30 And having_been_divulged to_me of_\add a\add*_plot going_to_be against the man, I_sent \add him\add* immediately to you, having_ also _commanded to_the accusers them to_be_speaking before you.
\v 31 Therefore indeed the soldiers according_to the \add thing\add* having_been_directed to_them, having_taken_up the Paulos, brought \add him\add* by night to the Antipatris.
\v 32 But on_the \add day\add* of_next, having_allowed the horsemen to_be_going_away with him, they_returned to the barracks, 
\v 33 who having_come_in into the Kaisareia, and having_delivered_up the letter to_the governor, they_ also _presented the Paulos to_him.
\v 34 And having_read \add it\add*, and having_asked of what province he_is, and having_learned that \add he_is\add* from Kilikia,
\v 35 he_was_saying I_will_be_thoroughly_hearing from_you: whenever also the accusers of_you may_arrive, having_commanded for_him to_be_being_guarded in the residence_of_the_governor the of_Haʸrōdaʸs.
\c 24
\nb
\v 1 And after five days, Ananias the chief_priest came_down with some elders, and Tertullos \add a\add*_certain \add an\add*_attorney, who reported to_the governor against the Paulos.
\v 2 And of_him having_been_called, the Tertullos began to_be_accusing \add him\add* saying: Of_great peace obtaining through you, and of_\add the\add*_reforms becoming to_ the this _nation through the your provision,
\v 3 both everything and everywhere, most_excellent Faʸlix we_are_welcoming \add it\add*, with all thanksgiving.
\v 4 But in_order_that I_may_ not _be_hindering more for you, the in_your gentleness I_am_imploring you to_hear from_us briefly.
\v 5 For/Because having_found the this man \add a\add*_pestilence, and stirring insurrections to_all the Youdaiōns which in the inhabited_world, and \add a\add*_ring_leader of_the of_the Nazōraios sect,
\v 6 who even attempted to_profane the temple, also whom we_apprehended.
\v 7
\v 8 from whom you_will_be_able yourself, having_examined \add him\add* concerning all these \add things\add*, to_know of_which \add things\add* we are_accusing against_him.
\v 9 And the Youdaiōns also piled_on, alleging these \add things\add* to_be_having thus.
\v 10 And the Paulos answered, the governor having_nodded to_him to_be_speaking, this for many years you being judge to_ the _nation Knowing, I_am_ cheerfully _defending the \add things\add* concerning myself.
\v 11 Of_you being_able to_know that there_are not more to_me twelve days, from which I_went_up going_to_prostrate in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim).
\v 12 And they_found me neither in the temple discussing with anyone or making \add a\add*_opposition of_\add a\add*_crowd, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city,
\v 13 nor are_they_being_able to_stand_by to_you, concerning which now they_are_accusing against_me.
\v 14 But I_am_confessing this to_you that according_to the way which they_are_calling \add a\add*_sect, thus I_am_serving unto_the ancestral \nd god\nd*, believing in_all the \add things\add* throughout the law and in_the \add things\add* having_been_written in the prophets,
\v 15 having \add a\add*_hope in the \nd god\nd*, which also these themselves are_waiting_for, \add a\add*_resurrection to_be_going going_to_be, of_\add the\add*_righteous both and of_\add the\add*_unrighteous.
\v 16 In this also I_ myself _am_exercising, \add a\add*_ inoffensive _conscience to_be_having toward the \nd god\nd* and the people through everything.
\v 17 And through more years I_arrived going_to_make alms to the nation of_me and offerings,
\v 18 at which they_found me in the temple having_been_purified, neither with \add a\add*_crowd, nor with commotion.
\v 19 But some Youdaiōns from the Asia, who it_was_fitting to_be_being_present before you and to_be_accusing, if anything might_be_having against me.
\v 20 Or let_ these themselves _say, what they_found wrong, having_stood of_me before the council,
\v 21 than concerning this one voice, which I_cried_out among them having_stood: that I am_being_judged by you_all today concerning \add the\add*_resurrection of_\add the\add*_dead.
\v 22 But the Faʸlix he_put_off them, having_known more_exactly the \add things\add* concerning the way, having_said: Whenever Lusias the commander may_come_down, I_will_be_investigating the \add things\add* concerning you_all, 
\v 23 having_directed to_the centurion him to_be_being_kept, and to_be_having relaxation, and to_be_forbidding no_one of_his own \add people\add* of_him to_be_attending to_him.
\v 24 But after some days, the Faʸlix having_arrived with Drousilla, his own wife being \add a\add*_Youdaios, he_sent_for the Paulos, and heard from_him concerning the faith in \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 25 But him discussing concerning righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment which coming, the Faʸlix having_become frightened, answered: the_ Present _\add time\add* being be_going, and having_taken time, I_will_be_summoning you.
\v 26 Together also hoping that money will_be_being_given to_him by the Paulos, therefore also more_frequently sending_for him, he_was_conversing with_him.
\v 27 But two_years having_been_fulfilled, the Faʸlix received successor Porkios Faʸstos, and wanting to_grant \add a\add*_favour to_the Youdaiōns, the Faʸlix left the Paulos having_been_bound.
\c 25
\nb
\v 1 Therefore Faʸstos having_set_foot_in in_the province after three, days went_up to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) from Kaisareia.
\v 2 And the chief_priests and the leaders of_the Youdaiōns reported to_him against the Paulos, and they_were_imploring him,
\v 3 requesting \add a\add*_favour against him, so_that he_may_send_for him to Hierousalaʸm (making \add an\add*_ambush to_kill him on the way).
\v 4 Therefore indeed which Faʸstos answered, the Paulos to_be_being_kept in Kaisareia, and himself to_be_going in quickness to_be_going_out.
\v 5 Therefore the powerful \add ones\add* among you_all: he_is_saying, having_gone_down_with, if anything perverse is in the man, them _let_be_accusing against_him.
\v 6 And having_stayed among them not more eight or ten days, having_come_down to Kaisareia, on_the \add day\add* of_next having_sat_down on the tribunal, he_commanded the Paulos to_be_brought.
\v 7 And of_him having_arrived, the Youdaiōns having_come_down from Hierousalaʸm stood_around him, bringing_against many and heavy charges, which they_were_ not _able to_demonstrate,
\v 8 of_ the _Paulos defending, that I_sinned neither against the law of_the Youdaiōns, nor against the temple, nor anything against Kaisar.
\v 9 But the Faʸstos wanting to_grant favour with_the Youdaiōns, answering to_ the _Paulos he_said: Are_you_willing to having_gone_up Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) concerning these \add things\add* to_be_judged there before me?
\v 10 But the Paulos said: Before the tribunal of_Kaisar having_stood I_am, where it_is_fitting me to_be_being_judged. I_have_done_ nothing _wrong To_\add the\add*_Youdaiōns, as also you very_well are_knowing.
\v 11 Therefore if on_one_hand I_am_doing_wrong and I_have_done anything worthy of_death, I_am_ not _refusing which to_die_off, on_the_other_hand if nothing is \add true\add* of_which these are_accusing against_me, no_one is_able to_grant me to_them. I_am_Appealing to_Kaisar. 
\v 12 Then the Faʸstos having_conversed_with with the counsel, answered: You_have_appealed to_Kaisar, you_will_be_going to Kaisar. 
\v 13 And some days having_elapsed, Agrippas the king and Bernikaʸ arrived to Kaisareia, having_greeted the Faʸstos.
\v 14 And as they_were_staying there more days, the Faʸstos placed_before before_the king the \add things\add* concerning the Paulos saying, certain \add a\add*_man There_is, \add a\add*_prisoner having_been_left by Faʸlix,
\v 15 concerning whom of_me having_become in Hierousalaʸm, the chief_priests and the elders of_the Youdaiōns reported, requesting conviction against him, 
\v 16 to whom I_answered that it_is not \add the\add*_custom with_Ɽōmaios to_be_granting any person before or/than the \add one\add* being_accused, might_be_having to face the accusers and \add the\add*_place of_defense might_take concerning the indictment.
\v 17 Therefore of_them having_come_together, here, having_made not_one delay, on_the_ next _\add day\add* having_sat_down on the tribunal, I_commanded the man to_be_brought, 
\v 18 concerning whom the accusers having_been_stood they_were_bringing not_one charge, of_which I was_suspecting evil \add ones\add*.
\v 19 But they_were_having against him some questions concerning their own superstition, and concerning \add a\add*_certain \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_died, whom the Paulos was_alleging to_be_living.
\v 20 And I perplexing, the debate concerning these \add things\add*, was_asking if might_be_wishing to_be_going to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and_there to_be_being_judged concerning these \add things\add*.
\v 21 But the Paulos having_appealed to_be_kept himself for the investigation of_the Emperor, I_commanded him to_be_being_kept, until of_which I_may_send_ him _up to Kaisar.
\v 22 And Agrippas \add said\add* to the Faʸstos: I_was_wishing also myself to_hear from_the man. Tomorrow, he_is_saying: you_will_be_hearing from_him.
\v 23 Therefore on_the \add day\add* of_next, the Agrippas and the Bernikaʸ having_come with great pageantry, and having_come_in into the auditorium with both commanders and men which in prominence in_the city, and having_commanded the Faʸstos, the Paulos was_brought.
\v 24 And the Faʸstos is_saying: king Agrippas, and all you_all being_present_with with_us, men, you_all_are_observing this \add one\add*, concerning whom all the multitude of_the Youdaiōns pleaded with_me, in both Hierousalaʸm and here, shouting not to_be_fitting him to_be_living no_longer.
\v 25 But I grasped him to_have_done nothing worthy of_death, and this \add one\add* himself having_appealed to_the Emperor, I_judged to_be_sending \add him\add*.
\v 26 Concerning whom I_am_ not _having any certain to_write to_my master. Therefore I_brought_ him _forth before you_all, and most_of_all before you, king Agrippas, so_that the examination having_become, I_may_have something I_may_write.
\v 27 For/Because it_is_supposing to_me illogical sending \add a\add*_prisoner, not also to_signify the charges against him.
\c 26
\nb
\v 1 And Agrippas was_saying to the Paulos: It_is_being_permitted to_you to_be_speaking concerning yourself. Then the Paulos having_stretched_out his hand was_defending,
\v 2 Concerning all \add things\add* of_which I_am_being_indicted by \add the\add*_Youdaiōns, king Agrippas, I_have_considered myself blessed going to_be_defending before you, today.
\v 3 Most_of_all you being knowledgeable_one of_all the among \add the\add*_Youdaiōns, of_ both _customs and questions, therefore I_am_beseeching \add you\add* patiently to_hear from_me.
\v 4 Therefore indeed the livelihood of_me, from youth which from \add the\add*_beginning having_become among the nation of_me and in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), all Youdaiōns have_known,
\v 5 knowing_before me originally, if they_may_be_willing to_be_testifying that according_to the most_exact sect the of_our religion, I_lived \add a\add*_Farisaios_\add party_member\add*.
\v 6 And now for \add the\add*_hope of_the promise to the fathers of_us, having_become by the \nd god\nd*, I_have_stood being_judged,
\v 7 to which the twelve_tribes of_us serving night and day in earnestness, is_hoping to_attain, concerning which \add the\add*_hope I_am_being_indicted by \add the\add*_Youdaiōns, king.
\v 8 Why is_it_being_judged unbelievable by you_all, if the \nd god\nd* is_raising \add the\add*_dead?
\v 9 Therefore indeed I supposed to_myself it_to_be_fitting to_do many contrary \add things\add* to the name of_\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* of_ the _from_Nazaret.
\v 10 Which also I_did in Hierousalaʸm, and many both of_the holy \add ones\add* I locked_up in prisons, having_received the authority from the chief_priests, and of_them being_killed, I_brought_ \add a\add*_vote _against \add them\add*.
\v 11 And in all the synagogues, often punishing them, I_was_compelling \add them\add* to_be_slandering, and exceedingly raging_against against_them, I_was_persecuting \add them\add* as_far_as even to the outside cities.
\v 12 At which journeying to the Damaskos/(Dammeseq), with \add the\add*_authority and permission which of_the chief_priests,
\v 13 middle day on the road king I_saw, from_heaven \add a\add*_light above the brightness \add like\add* of_the sun having_shone_around me, and the \add ones\add* journeying with me.
\v 14 And all of_us having_falling_down to the ground, I_heard \add a\add*_voice, saying to me in_the Hebraios language: Saulos/(Shāʼūl), Saulos, why are_you_persecuting me? \add It_is\add* hard for_you to_be_kicking against \add the\add*_prods.
\v 15 And I said: Who you_are, master? And the \nd master\nd* said: I am \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, whom you are_persecuting.
\v 16 But rise_up, and stand on the feet of_you, because/for I_was_seen by_you in this, to_appoint you \add a\add*_attendant and \add a\add*_witness, both of_which you_saw me and of_which I_will_be_being_seen by_you,
\v 17 rescuing you from the people and from the pagans, to whom I am_sending_ you _out,
\v 18 to_open_up eyes of_them, for_that to_turn_back from darkness to light, and from_the power of_ the _Satan/(Sāţān) to the \nd god\nd*, for_that them to_receive forgiveness of_sins and allotment among the \add ones\add* having_been_sanctified by_faith which in me.
\v 19 Whence, king Agrippas, I_became not unpersuadable to_the heavenly vision,
\v 20 but to_the \add ones\add* in Damaskos/(Dammeseq) first and both, in_Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and all the region of_ the _Youdaia, and to_the pagans, I_was_reporting to_be_repenting and to_be_turning_back to the \nd god\nd*, the worthy of_ works _repentance doing.
\v 21 On_account these \add things\add*, \add the\add*_Youdaiōns having_captured me in the temple, were_attempting to_hand_over \add me\add*.
\v 22 Therefore having_obtained of_help which from the \nd god\nd* until the this day, I_have_stood testifying to_small both and to_great, nothing besides saying of_what \add things\add* both the prophets and Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) spoke going to_be_becoming,

\v 24 And of_him defending these \add things\add*, the Faʸstos with_loud the voice is_saying: You_are_raving_mad, Paulos. The great learning is_turning you to madness. 
\v 25 But the Paulos: Is_saying I_am_ not _raving_mad: most_excellent Faʸstos, but I_am_speaking_out messages of_truth and sobriety.
\v 26 For/Because the king is_understanding concerning these \add things\add*, to whom I_am_ also _speaking speaking_boldly, because/for I_am_being_persuaded nothing to_be_escaping_notice him anything of_these \add things\add* not, because/for this is not having_been_done in \add a\add*_corner.
\v 27 king Agrippas are_you_believing, in_the prophets? I_have_known that you_are_believing.
\v 28 And the Agrippas \add said\add* to the Paulos: Are_you_persuading me in \add a\add*_little \add time\add* to_make \add a\add*_follower_of_the_messiah?
\v 29 And the Paulos \add said\add*: I_might_hope wishfully to_ the _\nd god\nd*, both in \add a\add*_little \add time\add* and in \add a\add*_great \add time\add*, not only you, but also all the \add ones\add* hearing from_me today, to_become such what_kind also_I am, except of_ the these _bonds.
\v 30 both the king and the governor Stood_up, the both Bernikaʸ and the \add ones\add* sitting_with with_them,

\v 1 And when it_was_judged which us to_be_sailing_away to the Italia, they_were_giving_over the both Paulos and some other prisoners, to_\add a\add*_centurion by_\add the\add*_name Youlios, of_\add the\add*_cohort of_Augustus/(Sebastos).
\v 2 And having_boarded on_\add a\add*_ Adramuttaʸnos _ship, we_were_launched going to_be_sailing to the places along the Asia, of_Aristarⱪos being with us, \add a\add*_from_Makedonia of_from_Thessalonikaʸ.
\v 3 Both on_the next \add day\add* we_were_set_down at Sidōn/(Tsīdōn), and the Youlios having_given_treatment with_human_kindness to_ the _Paulos, he_permitted \add him\add* having_been_gone to his friends, to_obtain of_care.
\v 4 And_from_there having_been_launched, we_sailed_under the Kupros, because_of that the winds to_be contrary.
\v 5 And having_sailed_across the sea which along the Kilikia and Pamfulia, we_came_down to Mura of_ the _Lukia.
\v 6 And_there the centurion having_found \add a\add*_ from_Alexandria _ship, sailing to the Italia, he_placed_in us into it.
\v 7 And in many days, slow_sailing and with_difficulty, having_become along the Knidos, the wind not further_permitting us, we_sailed_under the Kraʸtaʸ along Salmōn/(Salmōn)e.
\v 8 And sailing_along it with_difficulty, we_came to \add a\add*_ certain _place being_called Beautiful Harbours, to_which was near \add the\add*_city Lasaia.
\v 9 And much time having_elapsed, and the voyage already being dangerous, because_of that even the fasting already to_have_passed_by, the Paulos was_advising \add them\add*
\v 10 saying to_them: Men, I_am_perceiving that the voyage to_be_going going_to_be with damage and much loss, not only of_the cargo and to_the ship, but also the lives of_us.
\v 11 But the centurion was_being_persuaded by_the captain and the ship_owner rather, than by_the \add things\add* being_spoken by Paulos.
\v 12 And the harbour being unsuitable to winter, the more presented \add a\add*_counsel to_be_launched from_there, if somehow they_might_be_able, having_arrived at Foinix, to_winter \add a\add*_harbour of_ the _Kraʸtaʸ, looking to \add the\add*_southwest and to \add the\add*_northwest.
\v 13 And of_\add a\add*_south_wind having_blown_gently, having_supposed of_the purpose to_have_taken_hold, having_taken_up they_were_sailing_along nearer the Kraʸtaʸ.
\v 14 But after not much \add time\add*, \add a\add*_ typhoon _wind, which being_called \add the\add*_Eurokludōn throw down. from_it.
\v 15 And the ship having_been_seized, and not being_able to_be_facing to_the wind, having_given_up we_were_being_driven_along.
\v 16 And having_run_under \add a\add*_certain island being_called Klaudaʸ, we_were_able with_difficulty to_become control of_the lifeboat,
\v 17 which having_taken_up, they_were_resorting to_helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they_may_run_aground into the \add shallows_of\add* Surtis, having_lowered the gear, thus they_were_being_driven_along.
\v 18 And of_us being_ violently _storm_tossed, on_the_ next _\add day\add* they_were_making \add a\add*_jettison,
\v 19 and on_the third \add day\add*, they_threw_down the tackle of_the ship \add their\add*_own_hands.
\v 20 And neither sun nor stars appearing for more days, and no little storm laying_on \add us\add*, furthermore all hope, which us to_be_being_saved was_being_taken_away.
\v 21 And of_much abstinence being, then the Paulos having_been_stood in midst of_them said: It_was_fitting indeed, Oh men, having_yielded to_me, not to_be_being_launched from the Kraʸtaʸ, and to_gain the this damage, and the loss.
\v 22 And_yet now I_am_advising you_all the \add things\add* to_be_cheering_up, because/for not_one loss of_life will_be of you_all, except of_the ship.
\v 23 For/Because \add an\add*_messenger of_ the _\nd god\nd* stood_by me this the night, of_whose I_am, unto_whom also I_am_serving,
\v 24 saying: Be_ not _fearing, Paulos, it_is_fitting you to_stand_before before_Kaisar, and see, the \nd god\nd* has_granted to_you all the \add ones\add* sailing with you.
\v 25 Therefore be_cheering_up, men, because/for I_am_believing in_- \nd god\nd* that thus it_will_be, according_to which manner it_has_been_spoken to_me.
\v 26 But it_is_fitting us to_run_aground on \add a\add*_certain island.
\v 27 But when \add the\add*_fourteenth night became, us being_carried_through in the Adrias_Sea, to \add the\add*_middle of_the night, the sailors were_suspecting \add a\add*_certain to_be_coming_near to_them land.
\v 28 And having_taken_soundings, they_found twenty fathoms, and \add a\add*_little \add time\add* having_passed_by, and again having_taken_soundings, they_found fifteen fathoms.
\v 29 And fearing lest we_may_run_aground somewhere on rough places, having_thrown_down four anchors from \add the\add*_stern, they_were_hoping for_day to_become.
\v 30 And the \add the\add*_sailors seeking to_flee out_of the ship, and having_lowered the lifeboat into the sea, on_under_pretense as going to_be_stretching_out anchors from \add the\add*_bow,

\v 32 Then the soldiers cut_off the ropes of_the lifeboat, and they_allowed her to_run_aground.
\v 33 And until of_which day was_going to_be_becoming, the Paulos was_exhorting all, to_partake of_food saying: Today \add the\add*_fourteenth day \add is\add*, you_all_are_continuing waiting foodless, having_taken nothing.

\v 38 And having_been_satiated of_food, they_were_lightening the ship, throwing_out the wheat into the sea.
\v 39 And when day became, they_were_ not _recognizing the land, but were_observing \add a\add*_certain bay having \add a\add*_shore, on which they_were_counselling, if they_might_be_able to_preserve the ship.
\v 40 And having_cut_away the anchors, they_were_allowing \add them\add* in the sea, at_once having_unfastened the ropes of_the rudders, and having_lifted_up the foresail to_the \add wind\add* blowing, they_were_keeping for the shore.
\v 41 But having_fallen_among into \add a\add*_place two_sea, they_ran_ the ship _aground, and on_one_hand the bow having_stuck remained unshakeable, on_the_other_hand the stern was_being_destroyed by the force.
\v 42 And of_the soldiers, \add the\add*_counsel became that they_may_kill_off the prisoners, lest anyone having_swum_away may_escape.
\v 43 But the centurion wishing to_bring_ The Paulos _safely_through, because/forbade them of_their counsel, and he_commanded the \add ones\add* being_able to_be_swimming, having_thrown_off \add themselves\add* first, to_be_departing on the land,
\v 44 and the rest, on_one_hand some on planks, on_the_other_hand some on some \add things\add* which from the ship. And thus it_became, all to_be_brought_safely_through to the land.

\v 1 And having_been_brought_safely_through, then we_learned that the island is_being_called Melitaʸ.
\v 2 And the foreigners were_bringing_about not \add just\add* the having_been_ordinary human_kindness to_us, because/for having_lit \add a\add*_fire, they_received all us, because_of the rain which having_approached, and because_of the cold.
\v 3 But the Paulos having_gathered some multitude of_sticks, and having_laid_on \add them\add* on the fire, \add a\add*_viper having_come_out from the heat, clamped_down on_the hand of_him.
\v 4 And when the foreigners saw the wild_animal being_hanged from the hand of_him, they_were_saying to one_another: Certainly this the man is \add a\add*_murderer, whom having_been_brought_safely_through from the sea, the justice not allowed \add him\add* to_be_living.
\v 5 Therefore indeed he, having_shaken_off the wild_animal into the fire, suffered not_one harm.
\v 6 But they were_expecting him to_be_going to_be_being_swelled_up, or to_be_falling_down suddenly dead. But over much \add time\add*, them waiting and observing nothing amiss becoming to him, having_changed_their_minds they_were_saying him to_be \add a\add*_god.
\v 7 And in the \add parts\add* about the that place, was_being properties to_the leader of_the island by_\add the\add*_name Poplios, who having_accepted us hospitably lodged three days.
\v 8 And it_became, the father of_ the _Poplios to_be_lying_down being_gripped_with with_fevers and dysentery, to whom the Paulos having_come_in, and having_prayed, having_laid_on the hands on_him, he_healed him.
\v 9 And this having_become, also the rest which in the island having sicknesses were_approaching and were_being_healed,
\v 10 who also they_honoured us with_many honours, and being_launched, they_laid_on the \add things\add* for our needs.
\v 11 And after three months, we_were_launched in \add a\add*_ship having_wintered in the island, \add an\add*_from_Alexandria with_\add a\add*_figurehead to_Zeus_twins.
\v 12 And having_been_set_down at Surakousai, we_remained_on three days,
\v 13 whence having_cut_away, we_arrived at Ɽaʸgion. And after one day, having_come_on \add a\add*_south_wind, \add the\add*_second \add day\add* we_came to Potioloi,
\v 14 where having_found \add the\add*_brothers, we_were_implored by them to_remain_on seven days. And thus we_came to the Ɽōmaʸ.
\v 15 And_from_there the brothers having_heard, the \add things\add* concerning us, came to meeting with_us until Appios Market and Three Taverns, whom the Paulos having_seen, having_giving_thanks to_ the _\nd god\nd*, took courage.
\v 16 And When we_came_in to Ɽōmaʸ, it_was_permitted the to_Paulos to_be_remaining by himself, with the soldier guarding him.
\v 17 And it_became after three days, him to_call_together the \add ones\add* being leaders of_the Youdaiōns. And them having_come_together, he_was_saying to them: Men brothers I, having_done nothing contrary to_the people or the the ancestral customs, \add a\add*_prisoner from Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) was_given_over into the hands of_the Ɽōmaios,
\v 18 who having_examined me, were_wishing to_send_away \add me\add*, because_of that not_one cause of_death to_be_being in me.
\v 19 But speaking_against of_the Youdaiōns, I_was_compelled to_appeal to_Kaisar, not as having anything to_be_accusing against_the nation of_me.
\v 20 Therefore for this the cause, I_begged you_all, to_see and to_address, because/for on_account of_the hope of_ the _Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*), this the chain I_am_being_encompassed \add in\add*.
\v 21 And they said to him: We neither received letters concerning you from the Youdaia, nor having_arrived anyone of_the brothers reported or spoke anything evil concerning you.
\v 22 But we_are_considering_worthy to_hear from you what you_are_thinking, because/for indeed concerning the this sect it_is known to_us, that it_is_being_spoken_against everywhere.
\v 23 And having_determined \add a\add*_day for_him, more they_came to him to the lodging, to_whom he_was_explaining, testifying the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and persuading them concerning the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, from both the law of_Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh), and the prophets, from in_the_morning to evening.
\v 24 And on_one_hand the \add ones\add* were_being_persuaded by_the \add things\add* being_spoken, on_the_other_hand the \add ones\add* were_disbelieving.
\v 25 And being discordant with one_another, they_were_sending_away, the Paulos having_spoken one \add final\add* message: that Rightly the the holy \nd spirit\nd* spoke by Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊ\sup yāh\sup*) the prophet to the fathers of_you_all
\v 26 saying: Be_gone to the this people, and say: In_hearing you_all_will_be_hearing, and by_no_means you_all_may_ not _understand, and seeing you_all_will_be_seeing, and by_no_means you_all_may_ not _perceive.
\v 27 For/Because the heart of_ the this _people was_become_dull, and they_ hardly _heard with_their ears and they_shut the eyes of_them, lest they_may_see with_their eyes, and they_may_hear with_their ears, and they_may_understand with_their heart, and they_may_turn_back, and I_will_be_healing them.
\v 28 Therefore it_let_be known, to_you_all that this the salvation of_ the _\nd god\nd* was_sent_out to_the pagans, and they will_be_hearing. 
\v 29
\v 30 And He_remained_in two_ whole _years in \add his\add*_own rental, and was_welcoming all the \add ones\add* entering_in to him,
\v 31 proclaiming the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and unhinderedly teaching the \add things\add* concerning the \nd master Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*, with all boldness.
