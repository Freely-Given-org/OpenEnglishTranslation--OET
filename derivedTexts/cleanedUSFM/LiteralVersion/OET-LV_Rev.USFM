\v 15 I_have_known of_you the works, that neither cool you_are nor hot. Profit cool you_were or hot.
\v 16 Thus, because lukewarm you_are, and neither hot nor cold, I_am_going you to_spit out_of the mouth of_me.

\v 1 After these \add things\add* I_looked, and see, \add a\add*_door having_been_opened_up in the heaven, and the voice the first that I_heard \add was\add* like \add a\add*_trumpet speaking with me saying: Go_up here, and I_will_be_showing to_you what it_is_fitting to_become after these \add things\add*.
\v 2 Immediately I_became in \add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd*, and see, \add a\add*_throne was_lying in the heaven, and on the throne sitting,
\v 3 and the \add one\add* sitting \add was\add* similar in_appearance to_\add a\add*_stone, jasper and sardius, and \add a\add*_rainbow around the throne \add was\add* similar in_appearance to_\add an\add*_emerald.
\v 4 And around the throne \add were\add* twenty thrones four, and on thrones the twenty four elders sitting, having_been_clothed clothes white, and on the heads of_them crowns golden.
\v 5 And out_of the throne are_going_out lightnings, and voices, and thunders. And seven lamps of_fire being_burned before the throne, which is the seven spirits of_ the _\nd god\nd*, 
\v 6 and \add something\add* before the throne \add was\add* like \add a\add*_sea glass, similar to_crystal. And in \add the\add*_midst of_the throne and around the four, throne living_creatures \add were\add*, being_full of_eyes ahead and behind.
\v 7 And the living_creature the first \add was\add* similar to_\add a\add*_lion, and the second living_creature similar to_\add a\add*_calf, and the third living_creature having the face as of_\add a\add*_human, and the fourth living_creature similar to_\add an\add*_eagle flying.
\v 8 And the four living_creatures, one by one of_them, having each six wings, around and inside they_are_being_full of_eyes, and rest not they_are_having by_day and night saying: holy, holy, holy, \nd master\nd* the \nd god\nd* the almighty, who was, and who being, and who coming.
\v 9 And whenever will_be_giving the living_creatures glory, and honour, and thanksgiving, to_the \add one\add* sitting on the throne, the \add one\add* living to the ages of_the ages,
\v 10 will_be_falling the twenty four elders before the \add one\add* sitting on the throne, and they_will_be_prostrating before_the \add one\add* living to the ages of_the ages, and they_will_be_throwing the crowns of_them before the throne saying,

\v 1 And I_saw on the right \add hand\add* of_the \add one\add* sitting on the throne \add a\add*_scroll, having_been_written inside and behind, having_been_sealed_up seven with_seals.
\v 2 And I_saw \add an\add*_messenger strong, proclaiming in in_\add a\add*_voice loud: Who worthy to_open_up the scroll, and to_break the seals of_it?
\v 3 And no_one was_able in the heaven, and_not on the earth, nor beneath the earth, to_open_up the scroll, nor to_be_seeing it.
\v 4 And I_was_weeping much, because no_one worthy will_be_being_found to_open_up the scroll, nor to_be_looking it.
\v 5 And one of the elders is_saying to_me: Not be_weeping. Behold, overcame the lion which of the tribe of_Youda/(Yəhūdāh), the root of_Dawid/(Dāvid), to_open_up the scroll, and the seven seals of_it.
\v 6 And I_saw in \add the\add*_midst of_the throne and of_the four living_creatures and in \add the\add*_midst of_the elders, \add a\add*_lamb having_stood as having_been_slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of_ the _\nd god\nd*, having_been_sent_out into all the earth.
\v 7 And he_came and has_taken \add it\add* out_of the right \add hand\add* of_the \add one\add* sitting on the throne.
\v 8 And when he_took the four, scroll the living_creatures and the twenty four elders fell before the lamb, having each \add a\add*_harp and bowls golden being_full of_incenses, which are the prayers of_the holy \add ones\add*.
\v 9 And they_are_singing \add a\add*_song new saying: Worthy you_are to_take the scroll, and to_open_up the seals of_it, because you_were_slain, and bought to_ the _\nd god\nd* us by the blood of_you, out_of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation,
\v 10 and you_made them to_the \nd god\nd* of_us, \add a\add*_kingdom and priests, and they_will_be_reigning on the earth.
\v 11 And I_looked, and I_heard \add the\add*_voice of_messengers many around the throne, and of_the living_creatures, and of_the elders, and was the number of_them tens_of_thousands of_tens_of_thousands and thousands of_thousands,
\v 12 saying with_\add a\add*_voice loud: Worthy is the lamb which having_been_slain, to_receive the power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and blessing. 
\v 13 And every creature which in the heaven, and on the earth, and beneath the earth, and on the sea, and the \add things\add* in them all, I_heard saying: To_the \add one\add* sitting on the throne and to_the lamb \add be\add* the blessing, and the honour, and the glory, and the dominion, to the ages of_the ages.
\v 14 And the four living_creatures were_saying: Truly. And the elders fell and prostrated.

\v 1 And I_saw, when opened_up the lamb one of of_the seven seals, and I_heard from_one of the four living_creatures, saying as with_\add a\add*_voice of_thunder: Be_coming. 
\v 2 And I_looked, and see, \add a\add*_horse white, and the \add one\add* sitting on it having \add a\add*_bow, and was_given to_him \add a\add*_crown, and he_came_out conquering, and that he_may_conquer.
\v 3 And when he_opened_up the seal the second, I_heard from_the second living_creature saying: Be_coming. 
\v 4 And came_out another horse red, and to_the \add one\add* sitting on it, was_given to_him to_take the peace from the earth, and in_order_that one_another they_will_be_slaying, and was_given to_him \add a\add*_sword great.
\v 5 And when he_opened_up the seal the third, I_heard from_the third living_creature saying: Be_coming. And I_looked, and see, \add a\add*_horse black, and the \add one\add* sitting on it, having \add a\add*_scale in the hand of_him.
\v 6 And I_heard \add something\add* like \add a\add*_voice in \add the\add*_midst of_the four living_creatures saying: \add A\add*_ⱪoinix_\add measure\add* of_wheat three, for_\add a\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add* and ⱪoinix_\add measure\add* of_barley for_\add a\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add*, but the olive_oil and the wine not you_may_injure.

\v 9 And when he_opened_up the fifth seal, I_saw beneath the altar, the souls which having_been_slain because_of the message of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and because_of their testimony which they_were_having.
\v 10 And they_cried_out with_\add a\add*_voice loud saying: Until when the master the holy and true, not you_are_judging and are_avenging the blood of_us, from the \add ones\add* dwelling on the earth?
\v 11 And was_given to_them each \add a\add*_robe white, and it_was_said to_them that they_may_rest \add a\add*_time still little, until may_be_fulfilled also the fellow-slaves of_them, and the brothers of_them, the \add ones\add* going to_be_being_killed_off as also they.
\v 12 And I_saw when he_opened_up the seal the sixth, and \add an\add*_earthquake great there_became, and the sun became black as sackcloth hairy, and the moon whole became like blood,
\v 13 and the stars of_the sky fell to the earth, as \add a\add*_fig_tree is_throwing the unripe_figs of_it, by \add a\add*_wind great being_shaken.
\v 14 And the heaven was_separating like \add a\add*_scroll being_rolled_up, and every mountain and island out_of the places of_them were_moved.
\v 15 And the kings of_the earth, and the magnates, and the commanders, and the rich, and the mighty, and every slave and free \add man\add*, hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of_the mountains,
