\v 1 Paulos and Timotheos, slaves of_\nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, to_all the holy \add ones\add* in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous\nd* which being in Filippou, with \add the\add*_overseers and servants:
\v 2 grace to_you_all and peace from \nd god\nd* \add the\add*_father of_us and \add the\add*_\nd master Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 3 I_am_giving_thanks to_the \nd god\nd* of_me on every the mentioning of_you_all,
\v 4 always in every petition of_me for all of_you, with joy the petition making,
\v 5 for the fellowship of_you_all in the good_message, from the first day until the \add time\add* now,
\v 6 having_persuaded same \add thing\add* this, that the \add one\add* having_begun in you_all \add a\add*_work good, will_be_accomplishing \add it\add* until \add the\add*_day of_\nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous\nd*, 
\v 7 as it_is right for_me this to_be_thinking about all of_you, because_of that to_be_having me in my heart you_all, in both the bonds of_me, and in the defense and confirmation of_the good_message, fellow-partakers with_me of_the grace all you_all being.
\v 8 For/Because witness of_me the \nd god\nd* \add is\add*, how I_am_longing_for all you_all in \add the\add*_compassions of_\nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 9 And this I_am_praying, that the love of_you_all still more and more may_be_being_plentiful in knowledge and all insight,
\v 10 in_order that to_be_approving you_all the \add things\add* carrying_value, in_order_that you_all_may_be sincere and inoffensive to \add the\add*_day of_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*,
\v 11 having_been_filled with_\add the\add*_fruit of_righteousness which through \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd*, to \add the\add*_glory and praise of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 12 And to_be_knowing you_all, I_am_wishing, brothers, that the \add things\add* concerning me, more to \add the\add*_progress of_the good_message has_come,
\v 13 so_as the bonds of_me manifest in \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* to_become, in all the residence_of_the_governor and to_the rest all,
\v 14 and the more of_the brothers in \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* having_trusted by_the bonds of_me, more_abundantly to_be_daring fearlessly the message of_ the _\nd god\nd* to_be_speaking.
\v 15 Some on_one_hand even because_of envy and strife, on_the_other_hand some also because_of goodwill the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* are_proclaiming.
\v 16 The \add ones\add* on_the_other_hand out_of selfish_ambition the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* are_proclaiming, not purely supposing tribulation to_be_raising to_the bonds of_me.
\v 17 The \add ones\add* indeed from love having_known that for defense of_the good_message I_am_appointing,
\v 18 for what? Except that in_every manner, whether in_under_pretense or in_truth, \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* is_being_proclaimed, and in this I_am_rejoicing, but also I_will_be_being_elated.
\v 19 I_have_known for that this for_me will_be_turning_out to salvation through the of_you_all petition, and of_\add the\add*_supply of_the \nd spirit\nd* of_\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*,
\v 20 according_to the eager_expectation and hope of_me, that in nothing I_will_be_being_ashamed, but in all boldness, as always also now, will_be_being_magnified \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* in the body of_me, whether by life or by death.
\v 21 For/Because to_me which to_be_living \add is\add* \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, and which to_die_off \add is\add* gain.
\v 22 But if which to_be_living in \add the\add*_flesh, this for_me \add is\add* \add the\add*_fruit of_work. And what I_will_be_choosing not I_am_making_known.
\v 23 I_am_being_pressed and by the two, the desire having in_order that to_depart and with \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* to_be, because/for by_much more better,
\v 24 but which to_be_remaining_on in the flesh, more_necessary because_of you_all.
\v 25 And this having_persuaded, I_have_known that I_will_be_remaining and I_will_be_continuing_with with_all you_all for the of_you_all progress and joy of_the faith,
\v 26 in_order_that the boast of_you_all may_be_being_plentiful in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous\nd* in me, through the my coming again to you_all.
\v 27 Only worthily of_the good_message of_the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* be_living_as_citizen, in_order_that whether having_come and having_seen you_all, or being_absent, I_may_be_hearing the \add things\add* concerning you_all, that you_all_are_standing_firm in one with_one, spirit heart contending_together for_the faith of_the good_message,
\v 28 and not being_frightened in nothing by the \add ones\add* opposing, which is to_them \add a\add*_sign of_destruction, but to_you_all of_salvation, and this from \nd god\nd*,
\v 29 because to_you_all it_was_granted which concerning \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, not only which on him to_be_believing, but also which concerning him to_be_suffering,
\v 30 the same struggle having, such_as you_all_saw in me, and now are_hearing in me.

\v 1 If therefore any exhortation in \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, if any consolation of_love, if any fellowship of_\add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd*, if anyone \add has\add* compassions and compassions,
\v 2 fulfill of_me the joy, in_order_that the same \add thing\add* you_all_may_be_thinking, the same love having, united_in_soul, the one \add thing\add* thinking.
\v 3 Nothing \add do\add* according_to selfish_ambition nor according_to vain_conceit, but the in_humility one_another considering being_above of_themselves,
\v 4 not the \add things\add* of_themselves each looking_out, but also the \add things\add* of_others each.
\v 5 This be_thinking in you_all, which also in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* \add is\add*,
\v 6 who in \add the\add*_form of_\nd god\nd* being, not advantage considered which to_be equal with_\nd god\nd*,
\v 7 but himself emptied, \add the\add*_form of_\add a\add*_slave having_taken, in \add the\add*_likeness of_humans having_become. And in_form having_been_found as \add a\add*_human,
\v 8 he_humbled himself, having_become obedient unto death, and \add the\add*_death of_\add the\add*_stake.
\v 9 Therefore also the \nd god\nd* him highly_exalted, and granted to_him the name which above every name,
\v 10 in_order_that at the name of_\nd Yaʸsous\nd*, every knee may_bow of_heavenly and earthly and subterranean \add realms\add*,
\v 11 and every tongue may_confess that \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* \add is\add* \nd Yaʸsous\nd* \add is\add* \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, to \add the\add*_glory of_\nd god\nd* \add the\add*_father.
\v 12 So_then, beloved of_me, as always you_all_submitted, not as in the presence of_me only, but now by_much more in the absence of_me, with fear and trembling the of_yourselves salvation be_producing.
\v 13 For/Because \nd god\nd* is the \add one\add* working in you_all, both which to_be_willing, and which to_be_working, because/for his good_pleasure.
\v 14 All \add things\add* be_doing without grumblings and speculations,
\v 15 in_order_that you_all_may_become blameless and innocent, children of_\nd god\nd* blameless in_\add the\add*_midst of_\add a\add*_generation crooked and having_been_perverted, among whom you_all_are_shining as lights in \add the\add*_world,
\v 16 \add the\add*_message of_life holding_up to \add a\add*_boast to_me in \add the\add*_day of_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, because not in vain I_ran, nor in vain I_laboured,
\v 17 but if even I_am_being_poured_out on the sacrifice and ministry of_the faith of_you_all, I_am_rejoicing and I_am_rejoicing_with with_all you_all.
\v 18 And the same also you_all be_rejoicing and be_rejoicing_with with_me.
\v 19 But I_am_hoping in \add the\add*_\nd master Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, Timotheos quickly to_send to_you_all, in_order_that also_I may_be_encouraging, having_known the \add things\add* concerning you_all.
\v 20 For/Because no_one I_am_having kindred-spirit, who genuinely the \add things\add* concerning you_all will_be_caring_for.
\v 21 The \add ones\add* for all the \add things\add* of_themselves are_seeking, not the \add things\add* of_\nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 22 But the provenness of_him you_all_are_knowing, that as unto_\add a\add*_father \add a\add*_child \add serves\add*, with me he_served in the good_message.
\v 23 This \add one\add* therefore on_one_hand I_am_hoping to_send, when wishfully I_may_look_out the \add things\add* concerning me immediately, 
\v 24 on_the_other_hand I_have_persuaded in \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* that also myself quickly I_will_be_coming.
\v 25 But necessary I_considered, Epafroditos, the brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier of_me, and of_you_all ambassador and minister of_the need of_me, to_send to you_all,
\v 26 since longing_for he_was for_all for_you_all, and distressing because you_all_heard that he_ailed.
\v 27 For/Because also he_ailed nearly to_death, but the \nd god\nd* showed_mercy_to him, not and him only, but also me, in_order_that not sorrow on sorrow I_may_have.
\v 28 Therefore more_earnestly I_sent him, in_order_that having_seen him again, you_all_may_be_elated and_I less_anxious may_be.
\v 29 Therefore be_accepting him in \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* with all joy, and the such honoured \add ones\add* be_having,
\v 30 because because_of the work of_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* unto death he_neared, having_risked with_his life, in_order_that he_may_fulfill_up the of_you_all lacking, of_the toward me ministry.

\v 1 For/Because_the rest, brothers of_me, be_rejoicing in \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*. The same \add things\add* to_be_writing to_you_all, to_me \add is\add* on_one_hand not reluctant, on_the_other_hand for_you_all \add is\add* secure.
\v 2 Be_watching_out for_the dogs, be_watching_out for_the evil workers, be_watching_out for_the mutilation.
\v 3 For/Because we are the circumcision, the \add ones\add* in_\add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd* of_\nd god\nd* worshiping and boasting in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, and not in \add the\add*_flesh having_trusted,
\v 4 although I having confidence even in \add the\add*_flesh. If any is_supposing other to_have_trusted in \add the\add*_flesh, I more:
\v 5 in_circumcision \add the\add*_eight_day of \add the\add*_descent of_Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*) of_\add the\add*_tribe of_Beniamin/(Binyāmīn), \add a\add*_Hebraios of Hebraios, according_to \add the\add*_law \add a\add*_Farisaios_\add party_member\add*,
\v 6 according_to zeal persecuting the assembly, according_to righteousness which \add is\add* by \add the\add*_law having_become blameless.
\v 7 But which \add things\add* was to_me gain, these I_have_considered because_of the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* loss.
\v 8 But indeed_rather also I_am_considering all \add things\add* loss to_be, because_of that being_above the knowledge of_\nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous\nd* the \nd master\nd* of_me, because_of whom the \add things\add* all I_was_lost and I_am_considering \add them\add* rubbish, in_order_that \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* I_may_gain
\v 9 and may_be_found in him, not having my \add own\add* righteousness which of \add the\add*_law, but the \add righteousness\add* through faith in_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, the of \nd god\nd* righteousness \add based\add* on the faith,
\v 10 which to_know him, and the power of_the resurrection of_him, and fellowship of_\add the\add*_sufferings of_him, being_conformed to_the death of_him,
\v 11 if somehow I_may_attain to the resurrection which from \add the\add*_dead.
\v 12 Not that already I_received \add it\add*, or already I_have_been_perfected, but I_am_pursuing, if also I_may_grasp, in that also I_was_grasped by \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 13 Brothers, I myself not am_counting to_have_grasped \add it\add*, but \add I_do\add* one \add thing\add*: the \add things\add* on_one_hand behind forgetting, on_the_other_hand to_the \add things\add* ahead stretching_out,
\v 14 to \add the\add*_goal I_am_pursuing for the prize of_the upward calling of_ the _\nd god\nd* in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 15 Therefore as_many_as mature \add are\add*, this we_may_be_thinking, and if anything differently you_all_are_thinking, even this the \nd god\nd* to_you_all will_be_revealing.
\v 16 However to what we_attained, by_the same \add thing\add* to_be_aligning.
\v 17 Fellow-imitators of_me be_becoming, brothers, and be_observing the \add ones\add* thus walking, as you_all_are_having for_\add an\add*_example us.
\v 18 For/Because many are_walking, of_whom often I_was_telling to_you_all, and now even weeping, I_am_telling \add you\add*, the enemies of_the stake of_the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*,
\v 19 whose the end \add is\add* destruction, of_whose the \nd god\nd* \add is\add* their belly, and their glory \add is\add* in the shame of_them, the \add ones\add* the earthly \add things\add* thinking.
\v 20 For/Because of_us the citizenship in \add the\add*_heavens is_being, from which also \add a\add*_saviour we_are_eagerly_waiting, \add the\add*_\nd master Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*,
\v 21 who will_be_adapting the body of_ the _humiliation of_us, similar to_the body of_the glory of_him, according_to the working of_the \add thing\add* to_be_able him, even to_subject to_him the \add things\add* all.

\v 1 So_then, brothers of_me beloved and longed \add for\add*, joy and crown of_me, thus be_standing_firm in \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, beloved.
\v 2 Euodia I_am_exhorting, and Suntuⱪaʸ I_am_exhorting, the same \add thing\add* to_be_thinking in \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*.
\v 3 Yes, I_am_asking also you, genuine companion, be_giving_help to_them, who in the good_message contended_together with_me, with both Klaʸmaʸs and the rest of_\add the\add*_fellow-workers of_me, whose the names \add are\add* in \add the\add*_scroll of_life.
\v 4 Be_rejoicing in \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* always, again I_will_be_saying, be_rejoicing. 
\v 5 The gentle of_you_all let_be_known to_all people. The \nd master\nd* near.
\v 6 Nothing be_worrying, but in everything, the by_prayer and the petition with thanksgiving, the requests of_you_all let_be_being_made_known to the \nd god\nd*.
\v 7 And the peace of_ the _\nd god\nd* which being_above all mind, will_be_guarding the hearts of_you_all and the thinking of_you_all in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 8 For/Because_the rest, brothers, as_much_as is true, as_much_as dignified, as_much_as right, as_much_as pure, as_much_as lovely, as_much_as admirable, if any virtue, and if any praise, these \add things\add* be_counting.
\v 9 What both you_all_learned and you_all_received, both you_all_heard and you_all_saw, in me, these \add things\add* be_practicing, and the \nd god\nd* of_ the _peace will_be with you_all.
\v 10 But I_was_elated in \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* greatly, that now once you_all_revived which for me to_be_thinking, to which also you_all_were_thinking, but you_all_were_lacking_season.
\v 11 Not that concerning poverty I_am_speaking, because/for I learned in whatever \add situations\add* I_am content to_be.
\v 12 I_have_known both to_be_being_humbled, I_have_known and to_be_being_plentiful. In everything and in all \add things\add* I_have_been_enlightened, both to_be_being_satisfied and to_be_hungering, both to_be_being_plentiful and to_be_being_deficient.
\v 13 All \add things\add* I_am_being_strong in the \add one\add* strengthening me.
\v 14 However well you_all_did, having_participated of_me in_the tribulation.
\v 15 But have_known also you_all, Filippaʸsios, that in \add the\add*_beginning of_the good_message, when I_came_out from Makedonia, not_one with_me assembly shared in \add the\add*_matter of_giving and receiving, except not/lest you_all only.
\v 16 Because even in Thessalonikaʸ, both once and twice, because/for the need to_me you_all_sent.
\v 17 Not that I_am_seeking_after the gift, but I_am_seeking_after the fruit which being_plentiful to \add the\add*_account of_you_all.
\v 18 But I_am_receiving_fully all \add things\add*, and I_am_being_plentiful, I_have_been_filled, having_received from Epafroditos the \add things\add* from you_all, \add an\add*_aroma of_\add a\add*_sweet_fragrance, \add a\add*_sacrifice acceptable, well_pleasing to_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 19 But the \nd god\nd* of_me will_be_filling all \add the\add*_need of_you_all, according_to the riches of_him in glory in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 20 And to_the \nd god\nd* and father of_us \add be\add* the glory to the ages of_the ages. Truly. 
\v 21 Greet every holy \add one\add* in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous\nd*, are_greeting you_all the with me brothers,
\v 22 are_greeting you_all all the holy \add ones\add*, and most_of_all the \add ones\add* from the of_Kaisar house.
\v 23 The grace of_the \nd master Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd* \add be\add* with the spirit of_you_all. Truly.
