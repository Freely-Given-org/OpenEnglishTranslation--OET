\v 1 Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), of_\nd god\nd* and of_\add the\add*_\nd master Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*, twelve, \add a\add*_slave to_the tribes which \add are\add* in the dispersion: to_be_greeting.
\v 2 All joy consider \add it\add*, brothers of_me, whenever trials you_all_may_fall_among various,
\v 3 knowing that the proving of_you_all the faith is_producing endurance.
\v 4 And the endurance work \add its\add*_perfect let_be_having, in_order_that you_all_may_be perfect and complete, in nothing lacking.
\v 5 But if anyone of_you_all is_lacking of_wisdom, him _let_be_requesting from the \add one\add* giving, \nd god\nd*, to_all generously, and not deriding, and it_will_be_being_given to_him.
\v 6 But him _let_be_requesting in faith, nothing doubting, because/for the \add one\add* doubting is_like to_\add a\add*_wave of_\add the\add*_sea, being_blown and being_tossed.
\v 7 For/Because not let_be_supposing the person that that he_will_be_receiving anything from the \nd master\nd*,
\v 8 \add a\add*_man double-minded, disturbance in all the ways of_him.
\v 9 And let_be_boasting the brother the humble, in the height of_him,
\v 10 and the rich, in the humiliation of_him, because like \add a\add*_flower of_\add the\add*_grass he_will_be_passing_away.
\v 11 For/Because rose the sun with its scorching_heat, and withered the grass, and the flower of_it fell_from, and the beauty of_the appearance of_it perished. Thus also the rich \add man\add* among the pursuits of_him will_be_being_faded_away.
\v 12 Blessed \add is\add* \add the\add*_man who is_enduring trial, because approved having_become, he_will_be_receiving the crown of_ the _life, that he_promised to_the \add ones\add* loving him.
\v 13 No_one being_tempted let_be_saying, that By \nd god\nd* I_am_being_tempted. For/Because the \nd god\nd* untemptable is by_evil, and is_tempting he no_one.
\v 14 But each is_being_tempted by his own lust, being_drawn_away and being_enticed.
\v 15 Thereafter the desire having_conceived is_bearing sin, and the sin having_been_finished_out, is_bringing_forth death.
\v 16 Not be_being_misled, brothers of_me beloved.
\v 17 Every giving good, and every gift perfect from_above is, coming_down from the father of_ the _lights, with whom not there_is variation or of_shifting shadow.
\v 18 Having_been_wished \add it\add*, he_brought_forth us by_\add the\add*_message of_truth, in_order that to_be us first-fruit \add a\add*_certain of_the of_him creatures.
\v 19 Be_having˒_known, brothers of_me beloved. But let_be every person quick in_order that to_hear, slow in_order that to_speak, slow to anger,
\v 20 for/because \add the\add*_severe_anger of_\add a\add*_human, \add the\add*_righteousness of_\nd god\nd* not is_producing.
\v 21 Therefore having_put_away all filthiness and abundance of_evil, in gentleness receive the implanted message, the \add one\add* being_able to_save the souls of_you_all.
\v 22 And be_becoming doers of_\add the\add*_message, and not only listeners deluding yourselves.
\v 23 Because if anyone \add a\add*_listener of_\add the\add*_message is, and not \add a\add*_doer, this \add one\add* is_like to_man observing his face of_ the _existence of_him in \add a\add*_mirror.
\v 24 For/Because he_observed himself and has_gone_away, and immediately he_forgot what_kind he_was.
\v 25 But the \add one\add* having_investigated into \add the\add*_law perfect, the \add law\add* of_ the _freedom, and having_continued_with \add it\add*, not \add a\add*_listener of_forgetful having_become, but \add a\add*_doer of_\add the\add*_work, this \add one\add* blessed in the doing of_him will_be.
\v 26 If anyone is_supposing religious to_be, not bridling \add the\add*_tongue of_himself, but seducing \add the\add*_heart of_him, of_this \add one\add* useless \add is\add* his religion.
\v 27 Religion pure and undefiled before our \nd god\nd* and father this is: to_be_visiting orphans and widows in the tribulation of_them, spotless himself to_be_keeping from the world.

\v 1 Brothers of_me, not with favouritism be_holding the faith of_the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*, of_ the _glory.
\v 2 For/Because if may_come_in into \add the\add*_synagogue of_you_all, \add a\add*_man gold_ring, in clothing splendid, and may_come_in also \add a\add*_poor \add man\add*, in filthy clothing,
\v 3 and you_all_may_look_at on the \add one\add* wearing the clothing the splendid, and you_all_may_say: You be_sitting here good, and to_the poor you_all_may_say: You stand there, or: Be_sitting under the footstool of_me,
\v 4 not you_all_were_distinguished among yourselves, and became judges with_speculations evil?
\v 5 Hear, brothers of_me beloved: not the \nd god\nd* chose the poor in_the world, rich in faith \add to_be\add*, and heirs of_the kingdom which he_promised to_the \add ones\add* loving him?
\v 6 But you_all dishonoured the poor. Not the rich are_oppressing over_you_all, and they are_dragging you_all into courts?
\v 7 Not they are_slandering the good name which having_been_called on you_all?
\v 8 If however \add the\add*_law you_all_are_accomplishing royal, according_to the scripture: You_will_be_loving the neighbor of_you as yourself, well you_all_are_doing.
\v 9 But if you_all_are_showing_favouritism, sin you_all_are_doing, being_rebuked by the law as transgressors.
\v 10 For/Because whoever all the law may_keep, but may_stumble in one \add thing\add*, has_become of_all liable.
\v 11 For/Because the \add one\add* having_said: Not you_may_commit_adultery, said also: Not you_may_murder. And if not you_are_committing_adultery, but you_are_murdering you_have_become \add a\add*_transgressor of_\add the\add*_law.
\v 12 Thus be_speaking, and thus be_doing, as by \add the\add*_law of_freedom going to_be_being_judged.
\v 13 For/Because the judgement merciless \add will_be\add* to_the \add one\add* not having_doing mercy. Is_triumphing mercy over_judgement.
\v 14 What \add is\add* profit, brothers of_me, if faith may_be_saying anyone, to_be_having but, works not may_be_having? Not is_able the faith to_save him?
\v 15 If \add a\add*_brother or \add a\add*_sister naked may_be_being, and lacking of_ the _daily food,
\v 16 and may_say anyone to_them from you_all: Be_going in peace, be_warming and be_satisfying, not but you_all_may_give to_them the necessary \add things\add* for_their body, what \add is\add* profit?
\v 17 Thus also the faith, if not it_may_be_having works, dead it_is by itself.
\v 18 But will_be_saying someone: You faith are_having, and_I works am_having. Show to_me the faith of_you without the works, and_I to_you will_be_showing by the works of_me the faith.
\v 19 You are_believing that one is the \nd god\nd*. Well you_are_doing, even the demons are_believing and are_shuddering.
\v 20 But you_are_wanting to_know, Oh person vain, that the faith apart_from the works idle is?
\v 21 Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām) the father of_us not by works was_justified, having_offered_up Isaʼak/(Yiʦḩāq) the son of_him on the altar?
\v 22 You_are_seeing that his faith was_working_together with_the works of_him, and by his works his faith was_perfected.
\v 23 And was_fulfilled the scripture which saying: And believed Abraʼam in_- \nd god\nd*, and it_was_counted to_him for righteousness, and \add a\add*_friend of_\nd god\nd* he_was_called.
\v 24 You_all_are_seeing that by works is_being_justified \add a\add*_person, and not by faith only.
\v 25 And likewise also Ɽaⱪab/(Rāḩāⱱ) the prostitute not by works was_justified, having_welcomed the messengers and by_another way having_sent_forth?
\v 26 For/Because as the body apart_from spirit dead is, thus also the faith apart_from works dead is.

\v 1 Not many teachers be_becoming, brothers of_me, having_known that greater judgement we_will_be_receiving.
\v 2 For/Because in_many \add ways\add* we_are_stumbling all. If anyone in \add his\add*_message not is_stumbling, this \add a\add*_perfect man \add is\add*, powerful to_bridle also all his body.
\v 3 And, if of_the horses the bridles into the mouths we_are_putting, in_order that to_be_being_persuaded them to_us, also all the body of_them we_are_directing.
\v 4 Behold, also the ships, so_great being, and by winds hard being_driven, is_being_directed by \add the\add*_least rudder, wherever the impulse of_the \add one\add* straightening is_wishing.
\v 5 Thus also the tongue \add a\add*_small member is, and great \add things\add* is_boasting. Behold, how_much fire, how_much \add a\add*_forest is_kindling.
\v 6 And the tongue \add is\add* \add a\add*_fire, the world of_ the _unrighteousness, the tongue is_being_set_down among the members of_us, which staining all the body, and setting_on_fire the course of_ the _existence, and being_set_on_fire by the geenna.
\v 7 For/Because every nature of_wild_beasts both and of_birds, of_reptiles both and of_sea \add creatures\add*, is_being_tamed and has_been_tamed by_the nature the human, 
\v 8 but the tongue no_one to_tame is_able of_\add the\add*_people, \add an\add*_unstable evil, full of_poison deadly.
\v 9 In it we_are_blessing our \nd master\nd* and father, and in it we_are_cursing the people, the \add ones\add* according_to \add the\add*_likeness of_\nd god\nd* having_become.
\v 10 Out_of the same mouth is_coming_out blessing and curse. Not is_ought brothers of_me these \add things\add* thus to_be_becoming.
\v 11 Surely_not the spring out_of of_the same hole is_outflowing the sweet and the bitter?
\v 12 Not is_able, brothers of_me, \add a\add*_fig_tree olives to_produce or \add a\add*_vine figs? Nor salt sweet to_produce water.
\v 13 Who \add is\add* wise and understanding among you_all? Him_let_show out_of his good conduct the works of_him in \add the\add*_gentleness of_wisdom.
\v 14 But if jealousy bitter you_all_are_having, and selfish_ambition in the heart of_you_all, not be_boasting and be_lying against the truth.
\v 15 Not is this the wisdom from_above coming_down, but earthly, soulish, demonic.
\v 16 For/Because where jealousy and selfish_ambition \add is\add*, there \add is\add* disturbance and every evil matter.
\v 17 But the from_above wisdom, first indeed pure is, then peaceable, gentle, compliant, full of_mercy and of_fruits good, unceasing, unhypocritical.
\v 18 And \add the\add*_fruit of_righteousness in peace is_being_sown, by_the \add ones\add* making peace.

\v 1 From_where wars and from_where quarrels among you_all \add are\add*? Not \add is_it\add* from_here from the gratifications of_you_all, which warring in the members of_you_all?
\v 2 You_all_are_desiring and not you_all_are_having, you_all_are_murdering and are_being_jealous, and not you_all_are_being_able to_obtain, you_all_are_quarrelling and you_all_are_warring. Not you_all_are_having, because_of that not to_be_requesting you_all, 
\v 3 you_are_requesting and not you_all_are_receiving, because wrongly you_all_are_requesting, in_order_that in the gratifications of_you_all you_all_may_spend \add it\add*.
\v 4 Adultresses. Not you_all_have_known that the friendship with_the world, enmity the of_\nd god\nd* is? Whoever therefore if may_be_wished \add a\add*_friend to_be of_the world, \add an\add*_enemy of_ the _\nd god\nd* is_being_appointed.
\v 5 Or you_all_are_supposing that emptily the scripture is_saying: With envy is_longing_for the \nd spirit\nd* which \add is\add* made_to_dwell in us?
\v 6 But greater he_is_giving grace. Therefore he_is_saying: - \nd god\nd* against_\add the\add*_proud is_opposing, but to_\add the\add*_humble he_is_giving grace.
\v 7 Therefore be_subjected to_ the _\nd god\nd*. But resist against_the devil, and he_will_be_fleeing from you_all.
\v 8 Near to_ the _\nd god\nd*, and he_will_be_nearing to_you_all. Cleanse \add your\add*_hands, sinners, and purify \add your\add*_hearts, double-minded.
\v 9 Be_miserable, and mourn, and weep. The laughter of_you_all to mourning let_be_turned, and your joy to gloominess.
\v 10 Be_humbled before \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, and he_will_be_exalting you_all.
\v 11 Not be_slandering against_one_another, brothers. The \add one\add* slandering against_\add his\add*_brother or judging the brother of_him, is_slandering against_\add the\add*_law and is_judging \add the\add*_law. But if \add the\add*_law you_are_judging, not you_are \add a\add*_doer of_\add the\add*_law, but \add a\add*_judge.
\v 12 one there_is lawgiver and judge, the \add one\add* being_able to_save and to_destroy. But you who are, the \add one\add* judging your neighbor?
\v 13 Be_come now, you_all saying: Today or tomorrow, we_will_be_going into this the city, and we_will_be_working there \add a\add*_year, and we_will_be_merchandising, and we_will_be_profiting.
\v 14 Who not are_knowing on_the \add day\add* next \add will_be\add*, because/for what \add is\add* life of_you_all? For/Because \add a\add*_vapour you_all_are, which for \add a\add*_little \add time\add* appearing, then also being_perishing.
\v 15 Instead_of that to_be_saying you_all \add ought\add*: If the \nd master\nd* may_will, both we_will_be_living and we_will_be_doing, this or that.
\v 16 But now you_all_are_boasting in the arrogance of_you_all. All boasting such evil is.
\v 17 Therefore to_having_known \add one\add* good to_be_doing, and not doing \add it\add*, sin to_him it_is.

\v 1 Be_come now, you_all rich \add ones\add*, weep, wailing over the miseries of_you_all which \add are\add* coming_over.
\v 2 The riches of_you_all has_rotted, and the clothes of_you_all moth-eaten has_become.
\v 3 The gold of_you_all and the silver has_been_corroded, and the rust of_them for \add a\add*_testimony to_you_all will_be, and will_be_consuming the fleshes of_you_all like fire. You_all_stored_up in \add the\add*_last days.
\v 4 Behold, the wage of_the workers, which having_harvested the fields of_you_all, which having_been_withheld by you_all, is_crying_out, and the outcries of_the \add ones\add* having_reaped, into the ears of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* of_armies have_come_in.
\v 5 You_all_indulged on the earth. And you_all_lived_luxuriously, you_all_nourished the hearts of_you_all in \add the\add*_day of_slaughter.
\v 6 You_all_convicted, you_all_murdered the righteous, yet_not he_is_opposing against_you_all.
\v 7 Therefore be_patient, brothers, until the coming of_the \nd master\nd*. Behold, the farmer is_awaiting for_the precious fruit of_the earth, being_patient for it until he_may_receive \add the\add*_early and late \add rains\add*.
\v 8 Be_patient also you_all, strengthen the hearts of_you_all, because the coming of_the \nd master\nd* has_neared.
\v 9 Not be_groaning, brothers, against one_another, in_order_that not you_all_may_be_judged. Behold, the judge before the doors has_stood.
\v 10 \add An\add*_example take, brothers, of_ the _misfortune, and of_ the _patience, the prophets, who spoke in name of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd*.
\v 11 Behold, we_are_counting_blessed the \add ones\add* having_endured. The endurance of_Iōb/(ʼIyyōⱱ) you_all_heard, and the outcome of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* you_all_saw, that much_compassionate is the \nd master\nd* and compassionate.
\v 12 Before but, all \add things\add*, brothers of_me, not be_swearing, neither the by_heaven, nor the earth, nor other any oath, but let_be of_you_all your Yes \add be\add*, yes, and your No \add be\add*, no, in_order_that not under judgement you_all_may_fall.
\v 13 Is_suffering_hardship anyone among you_all? Him _let_be_praying. Is_cheering_up anyone? Him _let_be_singing_praises.
\v 14 Is_ailing anyone among you_all? Him_let_call_to the elders of_the assembly, and them_let_pray over him, having_anointed him with_olive_oil in the name of_the \nd master\nd*.
\v 15 And the vow of_ the _faith will_be_saving the \add one\add* faltering, and will_be_raising him the \nd master\nd*, and_if sins he_may_be having_done, it_will_be_being_forgiven to_him.
\v 16 Therefore be_confessing to_one_another your sins, and be_praying for one_another, so_that you_all_may_be_healed. Much is_prevailing \add the\add*_petition of_\add a\add*_righteous \add one\add* working.
\v 17 Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*) \add a\add*_man was like_natured to_us, and with_prayer he_prayed which not \add for_it\add* to_rain, and not it_rained on the earth, three years and six months.
\v 18 And again he_prayed, and the sky rain gave, and the earth sprouted the fruit of_it.
\v 19 Brothers of_me, if anyone among you_all may_be_strayed from the truth, and may_turn_back someone him,
\v 20 be_knowing that the \add one\add* having_turned_back \add a\add*_sinner from \add the\add*_deception of_\add the\add*_way of_him, will_be_saving \add the\add*_soul of_him from death, and will_be_covering \add a\add*_multitude of_sins.
