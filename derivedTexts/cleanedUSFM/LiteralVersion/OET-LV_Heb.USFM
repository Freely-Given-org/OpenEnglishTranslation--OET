\v 1 Many_ways and many_ways long_ago, the \nd god\nd*, having_spoken to_the fathers in the prophets
\v 2 in \add the\add*_last the days these, spoke to_us by \add his\add*_son, whom he_appointed heir of_all \add things\add*, through whom also he_made the ages, 
\v 3 who being \add the\add*_radiance of_his glory and \add the\add*_representation of_the reality of_him, and bearing the \add things\add* all by_the message of_the power of_him, \add the\add*_purification of_ the _sins having_made, sat_down at \add the\add*_right \add hand\add* of_the majesty on high.
\v 4 By_so_much better \add than\add* having_become the messengers, to_as_much_as more_special beside them, he_has_inherited \add a\add*_name.
\v 5 For/Because to_which he_said once of_the messengers: son of_me are you, I today have_bore you? And again: I will_be to_him for father, and he will_be to_me for son?
\v 6 And whenever again he_may_bring_in his firstborn into the inhabited_world, he_is_saying: And let_prostrate before_him all \add the\add*_messengers of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 7 And to on_one_hand the messengers he_is_saying: The \add one\add* making the messengers of_him spirits, and the ministers of_him of_fire \add a\add*_flame, 
\v 8 on_the_other_hand to the son: The throne of_you, the \nd god\nd*, to the age of_the age, and the scepter of_ the _righteousness \add is\add* \add the\add*_scepter of_the kingdom of_him.
\v 9 You_loved righteousness and you_hated lawlessness, because_of this, anointed you the \nd god\nd*, the \nd god\nd* of_you, with_\add the\add*_olive_oil of_exultation beyond the companions of_you.
\v 10 And: You in \add the\add*_beginnings, \nd master\nd*, the earth established, and works of_the hands of_you are the heavens.
\v 11 They will_be_perishing, but you are_continuing, and all like \add a\add*_garment will_be_being_grown_old,
\v 12 and as_if \add a\add*_covering you_will_be_rolling_up them, like \add a\add*_garment also they_will_be_being_changed, but you the same are, and the years of_you not will_be_failing.
\v 13 To but which of_the messengers he_has_said once: Be_sitting on \add the\add*_right of_me, until wishfully I_may_set the enemies of_you, as_\add a\add*_footstool for_the feet of_you?
\v 14 Not all they_are ministering spirits, because/for service being_sent_out, because_of the \add ones\add* going to_be_inheriting salvation?
\c 2
\nb
\v 1 Because_of this, it_is_fitting more_abundantly to_be_giving_heed us to_the \add things\add* having_been_heard, lest we_may_drift_away.
\v 2 For/Because if the by messengers having_been_spoken message became confirmed, and every transgression and disobedience received \add a\add*_just penalty,
\v 3 how we will_be_escaping of_so_great having_neglected \add a\add*_salvation? Which \add a\add*_beginning having_received, to_be_being_spoken by the \nd master\nd*, by the \add ones\add* having_heard to us was_confirmed,
\v 4 testifying_with \add them\add* of_ the _\nd god\nd* by_signs and/both, and wonders, and various miracles, and of_\add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd* holy distributions, according_to the of_him will.
\v 5 For/Because not to_messengers he_subjected the inhabited_world which coming, because/for which we_are_speaking.
\v 6 But testified somewhere someone saying: What is mankind, that you_are_remembering of_him, or \add the\add*_son of_man, that you_are_noticing him?
\v 7 You_made_less him, little something than \add the\add*_messengers, with_glory and honour you_crowned him,
\v 8 all \add things\add* you_subjected beneath the feet of_him. For/Because in that to_subject to_him the \add things\add* all, nothing he_left to_him insubordinate. But now not_yet we_are_seeing to_him the \add things\add* all having_been_subjected.
\v 9 But who little something than \add the\add*_messengers having_been_made_less, we_are_seeing \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, because_of the suffering of_ the _death, with_glory and with_honour having_been_crowned, so_that by_\add the\add*_grace of_\nd god\nd*, because/for everyone he_may_taste of_death.
\v 10 For/Because it_was_befitting to_him, because/for whom \add are\add* the \add things\add* all, and by whom \add are\add* the \add things\add* all, many sons to glory having_brought, the originator of_the salvation of_them, through sufferings to_perfect.
\v 11 The \add one\add* for both sanctifying, and the \add ones\add* being_sanctified, of one all \add are\add*, because/for which cause, not he_is_being_ashamed brothers them to_be_calling
\v 12 saying: I_will_be_reporting the name of_you to_the brothers of_me, in \add the\add*_midst of_\add the\add*_assembly I_will_be_singing_hymns to_you.
\v 13 And again: I will_be having_trusted in him. And again: Behold, I and the little_children, whom to_me gave the \nd god\nd*.
\v 14 Therefore because the little_children has_sharing of_blood and of_flesh, also he likewise partook of_the same \add things\add*, in_order_that through his death, he_may_nullify the \add one\add* the power holding of_ the _death, this is the devil,
\v 15 and may_release these, as_many_as by_fear of_death, through all the \add time\add* to_be_living, liable were to_slavery.
\v 16 For/Because not assuredly of_\add the\add*_messengers he_is_taking_hold, but of_\add the\add*_seed of_Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām) he_is_taking_hold.
\v 17 Whence he_was_ought in all \add things\add* to_his brothers to_be_likened, in_order_that \add a\add*_merciful he_may_become and faithful chief_priest in_the \add things\add* for the \nd god\nd*, in_order that to_be_being_made_atonement the sins of_the people.
\v 18 In for which has_suffered he having_been_tempted, he_is_able to_the \add ones\add* being_tempted to_give_help.
\c 3
\nb
\v 1 Whence, brothers holy of_\add the\add*_calling heavenly, partakers, observe the ambassador and chief_priest of_the confession of_us, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*,
\v 2 faithful being to_the \add one\add* having_established him, as also Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) in the house of_him.
\v 3 For/Because of_more this \add one\add* glory than Mōsaʸs he_has_been_considered_worthy, by as_much_as more honour \add than\add* is_having the house \add itself\add*, the \add one\add* having_prepared it.
\v 4 For/Because every house is_being_prepared by someone, but the \add one\add* all \add things\add* having_prepared \add is\add* \nd god\nd*.
\v 5 And Mōsaʸs on_one_hand faithful in all the house of_him, as \add a\add*_server for \add a\add*_testimony of_the \add things\add* going_to_speak,
\v 6 On_the_other_hand \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* as son over the house of_him, whose house are we, if our confidence and the boast of_our hope we_may_retain.
\v 7 Therefore as is_saying the \nd spirit\nd* the holy: Today if of_the voice of_him you_all_may_hear,
\v 8 not you_all_may_harden the hearts of_you_all, as in the rebellion, in the day of_ the _trial, in the wilderness,
\v 9 where tested \add me\add* the fathers of_you_all by trial, and they_saw the works of_me,
\v 10 for_forty years. Therefore I_was_angry the with_generation this, and I_said: Always they_are_being_strayed in_their heart, and they not knew the ways of_me, 
\v 11 as I_swore in the severe_anger of_me: Never they_will_be_coming_in into the rest of_me.
\v 12 Be_watching_out, brothers, lest will_be in anyone of_you_all \add a\add*_heart evil of_unbelief, in that to_withdraw from \nd god\nd* \add the\add*_living.
\v 13 But be_exhorting yourselves throughout each day, until of_which, which today it_is_being_called, in_order_that not may_be_hardened someone of you_all by_\add the\add*_seduction the of_sin.
\v 14 For/Because partakers of_the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* we_have_become, if_indeed the beginning of_the assurance, until \add the\add*_end confirmed we_may_retain.
\v 15 At the \add time\add* to_be_being_said: Today if of_the voice of_him you_all_may_hear, not you_all_may_harden the hearts of_you_all, as in the rebellion.
\v 16 For/Because some having_heard rebelled? But not all the \add ones\add* having_come_out out_of Aiguptos/(Miʦrayim) by Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh)?
\v 17 And with_whom_all he_was_angry for_forty years? Not \add was_it\add* with_the \add ones\add* having_sinned, of_whose the corpses fell in the wilderness?
\v 18 And to_whom_all he_swore not going_to_be_coming_in into the rest of_him, except not/lest to_the \add ones\add* having_disbelieved?
\v 19 And we_are_seeing that not they_were_able to_come_in because_of unbelief.
\c 4
\nb
\v 1 Therefore we_may_be_afraid, lest being_left \add a\add*_promise to_come_in into the rest of_him, may_be_supposing anyone of you_all to_have_falling_short.
\v 2 Also for we_are having_been_good_message_preached \add to_us\add* just_as also_those, but not benefited the message of_their hearing those, not having_been_united_together the with_faith to_the \add ones\add* having_heard.
\v 3 for/because we_are_coming_in into \add the\add*_rest, the \add ones\add* having_believed, as he_has_said: As I_swore in the severe_anger of_me: Never they_will_be_coming_in into the rest of_me, and_yet his works from \add the\add*_foundation of_\add the\add*_world having_been_become.
\v 4 For/Because he_has_spoken somewhere concerning the seventh \add day\add* thus: And rested the \nd god\nd* on the day the seventh from all the works of_him,
\v 5 and in this again: Never they_will_be_coming_in into the rest of_me.
\v 6 Therefore because it_is_being_retained for_some to_come_in into it, and the \add ones\add* previously having_been_good_message_preached, not came_in because_of disbelief,
\v 7 again \add a\add*_certain is_designating day: today, by Dawid/(Dāvid) saying after so_much time, as has_been_previously_said: Today if of_the voice of_him you_all_may_hear, not you_all_may_harden the hearts of_you_all.
\v 8 For/Because if them Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) rested, not would about another he_was_speaking after these \add things\add* day.
\v 9 Consequently is_being_retained \add a\add*_day_of_rest_rest for_the people of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 10 For/Because the \add one\add* having_come_in into the rest of_him, also he rested from the works of_him, as from his own \add works\add* the \nd god\nd* \add did\add*.
\v 11 Therefore we_may_be_earnest to_come_in into that the rest, in_order_that lest by the same someone example may_fall of_ the _disbelief.
\v 12 For/Because living \add is\add* the message of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and active, and sharper, beyond any sword double_edged, even penetrating until \add the\add*_division of_soul and spirit, of_joints both and marrows, and able_to_judge of_\add the\add*_thoughts and intentions of_\add the\add*_heart.
\v 13 And no there_is creation hidden before him, but all \add things\add* naked and having_been_exposed \add are\add* to_the eyes of_him, with whom to_us \add is\add* the account.
\v 14 Therefore having \add a\add*_chief_priest great, having_passed_through the heavens, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, the son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, we_may_be_taking_hold of_our confession.
\v 15 For/Because not we_are_having \add a\add*_chief_priest not being_able to_sympathize with_the weaknesses of_us, but having_been_tempted in all \add things\add* by likeness without sin.
\v 16 Therefore we_may_be_approaching with boldness to_the throne of_ the _grace, in_order_that we_may_receive mercy, and grace we_may_find, because/for opportune help.
\c 5
\nb
\v 1 For/Because every chief_priest from people being_taken for people is_being_appointed in_the \add things\add* for the \nd god\nd*, in_order_that he_may_be_offering gifts both and sacrifices for sins,
\v 2 to_be_forbearing being_able with_the \add ones\add* not_knowing and being_strayed, because also he is_being_encompassed with_weakness,
\v 3 and because_of it he_ought, as for the people thus also for himself, to_be_offering for sins.
\v 4 And not on_himself anyone is_taking the honour, but being_called by the \nd god\nd*, just_as also Aʼarōn/(ʼAhₐron).
\v 5 Thus also the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* not himself glorified to_be_become \add a\add*_chief_priest, but the \add one\add* having_spoken to him: son of_me are you, I today have_bore you.
\v 6 As also in another he_is_saying: You \add are\add* \add a\add*_priest to the age according_to the order of_Melⱪisedek/(Malkī-ʦedeq).
\v 7 Who in the days of_the flesh of_him, petitions both and supplications, to the \add one\add* being_able to_be_saving him from death, with clamour mighty and tears having_offered, and having_been_listened_to from the reverence.
\v 8 Although being \add a\add*_son, he_learned from what \add things\add* he_suffered the obedience,
\v 9 and having_been_perfected, he_became to_all the \add ones\add* submitting to_him \add the\add*_cause of_salvation eternal,
\v 10 having_been_designated by the \nd god\nd* \add a\add*_chief_priest according_to the order of_Melⱪisedek.
\v 11 Concerning whom much to_us the speech, and hard_to_explain to_be_speaking, because sluggish you_all_have_become in_the hearing.
\v 12 For/Because even ought to_be teachers because_of the time, again need you_all_are_having of_the \add one\add* to_be_teaching you_all, someone the principles of_the beginning of_the oracles of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and you_all_have_become need having of_milk, not of_solid food.
\v 13 For/Because everyone which partaking of_milk \add is\add* inexperienced in_\add the\add*_message of_righteousness, because/for \add an\add*_infant he_is.
\v 14 But for_\add the\add*_mature is the solid food, of_who because_of the practice their senses having_been_trained, having for distinction, of_good both and evil.
\c 6
\nb
\v 1 Therefore having_left the of_the beginning of_the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* message, to the perfection we _may_be_being_brought, not again \add a\add*_foundation laying_down of_repentance from dead works, and faith in \nd god\nd*,
\v 2 of_washings teaching, and of_laying_on of_hands, and of_\add the\add*_resurrection of_\add the\add*_dead, and of_judgment eternal.
\v 3 And this we_will_be_doing, if_indeed may_be_permitting the \nd god\nd*.
\v 4 For/Because impossible \add it_is\add* the \add ones\add* once having_been_enlightened, and having_tasted of_the gift the heavenly, and partakers having_been_become of_\add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd* holy,
\v 5 and \add the\add*_good having_tasted of_\nd god\nd* \add the\add*_message, and \add the\add*_powers of_\add the\add*_coming age,
\v 6 and having_fallen_away, again to_be_renewing \add them\add* to repentance, executing_on_a_stake in_themselves the son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and publicly_shaming \add him\add*.
\v 7 For/Because land which having_drunk the on it coming often rain, and bearing vegetation suitable, for_those because_of whom also it_is_being_cultivated, is_partaking of_blessing from the \nd god\nd*, 
\v 8 but bringing_out thorns and thistles, unqualified \add is\add* and \add a\add*_curse near, of_which the end \add is\add* to burning.
\v 9 But we_have_been_persuaded concerning you_all, beloved, of_the better \add things\add* and having of_salvation, if even thus we_are_speaking.
\v 10 For/Because not unrighteous \add is\add* the \nd god\nd*, to_forget about_the work of_you_all, and of_the love which you_all_displayed toward the name of_him, having_served unto_the holy \add ones\add* and serving.
\v 11 And we_are_desiring each of_you_all the same to_be_displaying earnestness, toward the full_assurance of_the hope until \add the\add*_end,
\v 12 in_order_that not sluggish you_all_may_become, but imitators of_the \add ones\add* through faith and patience, inheriting the promises.
\v 13 For/Because the to_Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām) having_promised the \nd god\nd*, because by no_one he_was_having greater to_swear, he_swore by himself
\v 14 saying: If surely blessing, I_will_be_blessing you, and multiplying, I_will_be_multiplying you.
\v 15 And thus having_been_patient, he_obtained by_the promise.
\v 16 For/Because people by the greater \add one\add* are_swearing, and of_all to_them controversy \add an\add*_end \add is\add*, because/for confirmation the oath \add given\add*.
\v 17 In which more_abundantly wishing the \nd god\nd* to_show to_the heirs of_the promise, the unchangeable of_the counsel of_him, guaranteed \add it\add* by_\add an\add*_oath,
\v 18 in_order_that by two matters unchangeable, in which impossible \add it_is\add* to_lie the for_\nd god\nd*, strong exhortation we_may_be_having, which having_taken_refuge to_take_hold_of of_the lying_before hope, 
\v 19 which as \add an\add*_anchor we_are_having of_the soul, certain both and confirmed, and coming_in into the inner \add side\add* of_the curtain,
\v 20 where \add a\add*_forerunner for us came_in, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, according_to the order of_Melⱪisedek/(Malkī-ʦedeq), \add a\add*_chief_priest having_become to the age.
\c 7
\nb
\v 1 For/Because this the Melⱪisedek, king of_Salaʸm/(Shālēm), priest of_ the _\nd god\nd* the highest, the \add one\add* having_met with_Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām) returning from the slaughter of_the kings, and having_blessed him,
\v 2 to_whom also \add a\add*_tenth of all \add things\add* allotted Abraʼam, first on_one_hand being_translated king of_righteousness, on_the_other_hand then also king of_Salaʸm, which is: king of_peace,
\v 3 fatherless, motherless, without_genealogy, neither beginning of_days, nor of_life end having, but having_been_likened to_the son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, he_is_remaining \add a\add*_priest in the continual.
\v 4 And be_observing how_great \add is\add* this \add one\add*, to_whom \add a\add*_tenth Abraʼam, gave out_of the best_spoils, the patriarch.
\v 5 And the \add ones\add* on_one_hand from the sons of_Leui/(Lēvī) the priestly_office receiving, \add a\add*_command are_having to_be_tithing the people according_to the law, this is the brothers of_them, although having_come_out out_of the loin of_Abraʼam, 
\v 6 on_the_other_hand the \add one\add* not being_traced from them, has_tithed Abraʼam, and the \add one\add* having the promises, he_has_blessed.
\v 7 But apart_from from_all controversy, the lessor by the better is_being_blessed.
\v 8 And here on_one_hand tithes dying_off people are_receiving, on_the_other_hand there being_attested that he_is_living.
\v 9 And as so_to_speak to_say, through Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām), even Leui/(Lēvī), the \add one\add* tithes receiving, has_been_tithed.
\v 10 For/Because still in the loin of_his father he_was, when met with_him Melⱪisedek/(Malkī-ʦedeq).
\v 11 If therefore indeed perfection by the Leuitaʸs/(from_tribe_of_Lēvī) priesthood was, the for people on it has_been_legislated, what still need \add was_there\add* according_to the order of_Melⱪisedek, for_another to_be_rising_up priest, and not according_to the order of_Aʼarōn/(ʼAhₐron) to_be_being_called?
\v 12 For/Because being_replaced the priesthood, from necessity also of_law \add a\add*_changing is_becoming.
\v 13 With for whom is_being_said these \add things\add*, of_tribe another has_partaken, from which no_one has_served at_the altar.
\v 14 For/Because quite_evident \add it_is\add*, that out_of Youda/(Yəhūdāh) has_risen the \nd master\nd* of_us, because/for which \add a\add*_tribe concerning priests nothing Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) spoke.
\v 15 And more_abundant still very_evident it_is, if according_to the likeness of_Melⱪisedek, is_rising_up priest another,
\v 16 who not according_to \add the\add*_law of_\add a\add*_command fleshy has_become, but according_to \add the\add*_power of_\add a\add*_life indestructible.
\v 17 For/Because it_is_being_testified, that You \add are\add* \add a\add*_priest to the age according_to the order of_Melⱪisedek.
\v 18 \add An\add*_annulment for on_one_hand is_becoming of_going_before \add the\add*_command, because_of the of_it weak and unprofitable,
\v 19 (for nothing perfected the law), on_the_other_hand \add the\add*_introduction of_\add a\add*_better hope, by which we_are_nearing to_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 20 And to as_much_as not apart_from oath, the \add ones\add* for on_one_hand without \add an\add*_oath are priests having_become,
\v 21 on_the_other_hand the \add one\add* with \add an\add*_oath by the \add one\add* saying to him: Swore \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, and not will_be_being_regretful: You \add are\add* \add a\add*_priest for the age,
\v 22 by so_much also of_\add a\add*_better covenant, has_become \add the\add*_guarantee, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 23 And the \add ones\add* on_one_hand more are having_become priests, because_of that by_death to_be_being_forbidden to_be_continuing_with, 
\v 24 on_the_other_hand the \add one\add* because_of that to_be_remaining him for the age, permanent is_holding the priesthood.
\v 25 Whence even to_be_saving to the full_extent he_is_able, the \add ones\add* approaching through him to_ the _\nd god\nd*, always living in_order that to_be_pleading for them.
\v 26 For/Because such for_us also was_befitting \add a\add*_chief_priest, devout, innocent, undefiled, having_been_separated from the sinners, and higher \add than\add* the heavens having_become, 
\v 27 who not is_having in_every day necessity, as the chief_priests, previously for his own sins sacrifices to_be_offering_up, then for_the \add sins\add* of_the people, because/for this he_did once_for_all, himself having_offered_up.
\v 28 The for law men is_appointing as_chief_priests having weakness, the but message of_the oath, which \add is\add* after the law, \add a\add*_son, because/for the age having_been_perfected.
\c 8
\nb
\v 1 And \add the\add*_point in the \add things\add* being_spoken: such we_are_having \add a\add*_chief_priest, who sat_down on \add the\add*_right of_the throne of_the majesty in the heavens,
\v 2 of_the holy \add places\add* \add a\add*_minister and of_the tent the true, which pitched the \nd master\nd*, not humans.
\v 3 For/Because every chief_priest in_order that to_be_offering, gifts both and sacrifices is_being_appointed, whence \add it_is\add* necessary to_be_having something also for_this \add one\add* that he_may_offer.
\v 4 If on_one_hand therefore he_was on earth, not_even wishfully he_was \add a\add*_priest, being which offering according_to law the gifts,
\v 5 who for_\add a\add*_copy and shadow are_serving of_the heavenly \add realms\add*, as has_been_warned Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh), going to_be_accomplishing the for: tent, be_seeing he_is_saying: you_will_be_making all \add things\add* according_to the pattern which having_been_shown to_you in the mountain.
\v 6 On_the_other_hand now of_\add a\add*_more_special he_has_obtained ministry, by_as_much_as also of_\add a\add*_better is covenant \add the\add*_mediator, which on better promises has_been_legislated.

\v 5 And above it, Cherubims of_glory overshadowing the mercy_seat, concerning which not it_is now to_be_speaking in part.
\v 6 And these \add things\add* thus having_been_prepared, into on_one_hand the first tent \add room\add*, through everything are_entering the priests, the sacred_services accomplishing,

\v 8 This making_evident the \nd spirit\nd* the holy \add is\add*, that_not_yet to_have_revealed the of_the holy \add places\add* way, still of_the first tent \add room\add* having standing,

\v 13 For/Because if the blood of_goats, and bulls, and \add the\add*_ashes of_\add a\add*_heifer, sprinkling the \add ones\add* having_been_defiled, is_sanctifying \add them\add* for the of_the flesh purification,

\v 17 For/Because \add a\add*_covenant with dead \add bodies\add* confirmed \add is\add*, because never it_is_being_effective, when is_living the \add one\add* having_covenanted \add it\add*.
\v 18 Whence neither the first \add covenant\add* apart_from blood has_been_dedicated.
\v 19 For/Because having_been_spoken every command according_to the law by Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) to_all the people, having_taken the blood of_ the _calves, and of_ the _goats, with water, and wool scarlet, and hyssop, itself both the scroll and all the people, he_sprinkled
\v 20 saying: This the blood of_the covenant, which commanded toward you_all the \nd god\nd*.
\v 21 Both the and, tent, and all the vessels of_the ministry, with_the blood likewise he_sprinkled.
\v 22 And almost by blood all \add things\add* is_being_cleansed according_to the law, and apart_from bloodshed, not is_becoming forgiveness.
\v 23 Therefore necessity \add it_was\add* the on_one_hand copies of_the \add things\add* in the heavens with_these to_be_being_purified, on_the_other_hand themselves the heavenly \add things\add* with_better sacrifices than these.

\v 25 Nor in_order_that often he_may_be_offering himself, as the chief_priest is_coming_in into the holy \add places\add* in_every year with blood anothers,
\v 26 otherwise it_was_fitting him often to_suffer from \add the\add*_foundation of_\add the\add*_world. But now once in \add the\add*_completion of_the ages, because/for \add the\add*_annulment of_sin by the sacrifice of_him he_has_been_revealed.
\v 27 And in as_much_as it_is_laid_away to_ the _people once to_die_off, and after this judgment,

\v 2 Because not would they_ceased being_offered, because_of that not_one to_be_having anymore conscience of_sins, the \add ones\add* serving once having_been_cleansed?
\v 3 But in them \add there_is\add* \add a\add*_remembrance of_sins in_every year.
\v 4 For/Because impossible \add it_is\add* for_\add the\add*_blood of_goats and of_bulls to_be_taking_away sins.
\v 5 Therefore coming_in into the world, he_is_saying: Sacrifice and offering not you_wanted, but \add a\add*_body you_prepared for_me.
\v 6 Whole_burnt_offerings and \add sacrifices\add* for sin not you_took_pleasure.

\v 8 Earlier saying, that Sacrifices, and offerings, and whole_burnt_offerings, and \add offerings\add* for sin, neither you_wanted, nor you_took_pleasure (which according_to law are_being_offered),
\v 9 then he_has_said: Behold, I_am_coming which to_do the will of_you. He_is_killing the first \add covenant\add*, in_order_that the second he_may_establish.
\v 10 By that will, having_been_sanctified we_are through the offering of_the body of_\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd* once_for_all.
\v 11 And every indeed priest has_stood in_every day ministering, and the same often offering sacrifices, which never are_being_able to_take_away sins.

\v 13 for_the rest, awaiting until may_be_put the enemies of_him \add a\add*_footstool for_the feet of_him.
\v 14 For/Because by_one offering, he_has_perfected for the continual the \add ones\add* being_sanctified.
\v 15 And is_testifying to_us also the \nd spirit\nd* the holy, because/for after which to_have_said,
\v 16 This \add is\add* the covenant which I_will_be_covenanting with them after the days those, is_saying \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, giving \add the\add*_laws of_me in \add the\add*_hearts of_them, also in the mind of_them I_will_be_inscribing them…

\v 18 And where forgiveness of_these \add is\add*, no_longer \add there_is\add* \add an\add*_offering for sin.
