\v 1 In \add the\add*_beginning was the message, and the message was with the \nd god\nd*, and \nd god\nd* was the message.
\v 2 This \add one\add* was in \add the\add*_beginning with the \nd god\nd*.
\v 3 All \add things\add* became through him, and without him not_even one \add thing\add* became that has_become.
\v 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of_ the _mankind.
\v 5 And the light is_shining in the darkness, and it not grasped the darkness.
\v 6 \add A\add*_man became having_been_sent_out from \nd god\nd*, Yōannaʸs \add the\add*_name to_him \add was\add*.
\v 7 This \add one\add* came for \add a\add*_testimony, in_order_that he_may_testify concerning the light, in_order_that all may_believe through him.
\v 8 That \add one\add* was not the light, but in_order_that he_may_testify concerning the light.
\v 9 It_was the the true light, which is_enlightening every person, coming into the world.
\v 10 He_was in the world, and the world became through him, and the world not knew him.
\v 11 He_came to his own, and his own not received him.
\v 12 But as_many_as received him, he_gave to_them \add the\add*_right to_become children of_\nd god\nd*, to_the \add ones\add* believing in the name of_him,
\v 13 who were_born neither of bloods, nor of will of_flesh, nor of will of_man, but of \nd god\nd*.
\v 14 And the message became flesh and sheltered among us, and we_saw the glory of_him, \add a\add*_glory as of_\add an\add*_only_begotten with \add a\add*_father, full of_grace and truth.
\v 15 Yōannaʸs is_testifying concerning him, and he_has_cried_out saying: This \add one\add* was whom I_said: The \add one\add* coming after me, has_become before of_me, because he_was before me.
\v 16 Because of the fullness of_him, we all received and grace for grace.
\v 17 Because the law was_given through Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh), the grace and the truth became through \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 18 No_one has_ ever _seen \nd god\nd*, \add the\add*_only_begotten \nd god\nd*, the \add one\add* being in the bosom of_the father, that \add one\add* explained \add him\add*.
\v 19 And this is the testimony of_ the _Yōannaʸs, when the Youdaiōns sent_out priests and Levites from Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), in_order_that they_may_ask him: Who are you?
\v 20 And he_confessed and not disowned, but confessed, that I am not the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 21 And they_asked him, What therefore? Are you Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*)? And he_is_saying: I_am not. Are you the prophet? And he_answered: No.
\v 22 Therefore they_said to_him: Who are_you? In_order_that we_may_give \add an\add*_answer to_the \add ones\add* having_sent us. What are_you_saying about yourself?
\v 23 He_was_saying: I \add am\add* \add A\add*_voice shouting in the wilderness straighten the way of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, as Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊ\sup yāh\sup*) the prophet said.
\v 24 And having_been_sent_out they_were from the Farisaios_\add party\add*.
\v 25 And they_asked him and they_said to_him: Therefore why you_are_immersing, if you not are the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, nor Aʸlias, nor the prophet?
\v 26 The Yōannaʸs answered to_them saying: I am_immersing in water, in_\add the\add*_midst of_you_all one_has_stood whom you_all have_ not _known,
\v 27 the \add one\add* coming after me, of_whom I am not worthy that I_may_untie the strap of_the sandal of_him.
\v 28 These \add things\add* became in Baʸthania, beyond the Yordanaʸs/(Yardēn), where the Yōannaʸs was immersing.
\v 29 On_the \add day\add* of_next he_is_seeing the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* coming to him, and is_saying: Behold, the lamb of_ the _\nd god\nd*, which taking_away the sin of_the world.
\v 30 It_is this \add one\add* concerning whom I said: After me is_coming \add a\add*_man, who has_become before me, because he_was before me.
\v 31 And_I had_ not _known him, but in_order_that may_be_revealed to_ the _Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*) because_of this, I came immersing in water.
\v 32 And Yōannaʸs testified saying, that I_have_seen the \nd spirit\nd* coming_down as \add a\add*_dove out_of heaven, and it_remained on him.
\v 33 And_I had_ not _known him, but the \add one\add* having_sent me to_be_immersing in water, that \add one\add* said to_me: On whom wishfully you_may_see the \nd spirit\nd* coming_down and remaining on him, he is the \add one\add* immersing in \add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*.
\v 34 And_I have_seen and have_testified that this is the son of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 35 On_the \add day\add* of_next again the Yōannaʸs had_stood, and two of the apprentices/followers of_him.
\v 36 And having_focused_in the on_\nd Yaʸsous\nd* walking he_is_saying: Behold, the lamb of_ the _\nd god\nd*. 
\v 37 And the two apprentices/followers of_him heard speaking, and they_followed the after_\nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 38 But the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_been_turned, and having_seen them following, he_is_saying to_them: What you_all_are_seeking? And they said to_him: My_great_\add one\add* (which is_being_called being_translated: Teacher): Where you_are_remaining?
\v 39 He_is_saying to_them: Be_coming and you_all_will_be_seeing. Therefore they_came and saw where he_is_remaining, and they_remained with him the that day, \add the\add*_hour was about \add the\add*_tenth.
\v 40 Andreas the brother of_Simōn Petros was, one of the two which having_heard from Yōannaʸs, and having_followed after_him.
\v 41 This \add one\add* first is_finding the his own brother Simōn, and is_saying to_him: We_have_found the chosen_one/messiah, (which is being_translated: \add The\add*_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*).
\v 42 he_led him to the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*. Having_focused_in on_him, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said: You are Simōn the son of_Yōannaʸs, you will_be_being_called Kaʸfas, (which is_being_translated: \add The\add*_Stone/Petros).
\v 43 On_the \add day\add* of_next he_wanted to_come_out into the Galilaia/(Gālīl). And he_is_finding Filippos, and \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him the: Be_following after_me.
\v 44 And the Filippos was from Baʸthsaida, of the city of_Andreas and Petros.
\v 45 Filippos is_finding the Nathanaaʸl, and he_is_saying to_him: We_have_found whom wrote Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) in the law and the prophets, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* son the of_Yōsaʸf/(Yōşēf), who \add is\add* from Nazaret.
\v 46 And Nathanaaʸl said to_him: Is_able any good to_be out_of Nazaret? The Filippos is_saying to_him: Be_coming and see.
\v 47 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* saw the Nathanaaʸl coming to him and he_is_saying concerning him: Behold, truly \add an\add*_Israelite in whom is not deceit.
\v 48 Nathanaaʸl is_saying to_him: From_where you_are_knowing me? \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered and said to_him: Before the \add time\add* Filippos to_call you, being under the fig_tree, I_saw you.
\v 49 Nathanaaʸl answered to_him: My_great_\add one\add*, you are the son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, you are king of_ the _Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*).
\v 50 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered and said to_him: Because I_said to_you that I_saw you beneath the fig_tree, you_are_believing? You_will_be_seeing greater \add than\add* these \add things\add*.
\v 51 And he_is_saying to_him: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, you_all_will_be_seeing the heaven having_opened_up, and the messengers of_ the _\nd god\nd* going_up and coming_down on the son of_ the _Man.

\v 1 And on_the the third day \add a\add*_wedding became in Kana of_ the _Galilaia/(Gālīl), and the mother of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd* was there.
\v 2 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* was_ also _invited and the apprentices/followers of_him to the wedding.
\v 3 And having_been_deficient of_wine, the mother the of_\nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to him: They_are_ not _having wine.
\v 4 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_her: What to_me and to_you, woman? The hour of_me is_ not_yet _coming.
\v 5 The mother of_him is_saying to_the servants: Do whatever anything wishfully he_may_be_saying to_you_all.
\v 6 And six stone waterpots were lying there according_to the purification of_the Youdaiōns, having_room_for two or three measures each.
\v 7 Is_saying to_them the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*: Fill the waterpots with_water. And they_filled them to upward.
\v 8 And he_is_saying to_them: Draw now and be_carrying to_the \add the\add*_headwaiter. And they carried \add it\add*.
\v 9 And when the \add the\add*_headwaiter tasted the water having_been_become wine, and had_ not _known from_where is, but the servants had_known the \add ones\add* having_drawn the water, the headwaiter is_calling the bridegroom
\v 10 and he_is_saying to_him: Every person is_presenting first the good wine, and the lessor whenever they_may_be_being_drunk, you have_kept the good wine until now.
\v 11 This beginning of_the signs the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* did in Kana the of_Galilaia/(Gālīl), and revealed the glory of_him, and the apprentices/followers of_him believed in him.
\v 12 After this he_came_down to Kafarnaʼoum, he and the mother of_him, and the brothers and the apprentices/followers of_him, and they_remained there not many days.
\v 13 And the passover_\add feast\add* of_the Youdaiōns was near, and the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* went_up to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim).
\v 14 And he_found in the temple the \add ones\add* selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.
\v 15 And having_made \add a\add*_whip of cords, all he_throw_out both the sheep and the oxen from the temple, and he_poured_out the coins of_the moneychangers, and he_overturned the tables.
\v 16 And to_the \add ones\add* selling the doves he_said: Take_away these \add things\add* from_here, not be_making the house of_the father of_me \add a\add*_house of_business.
\v 17 the apprentices/followers of_him ˓Were˒_reminded that having_been_written it_is: The zeal of_the house of_you will_be_consuming me.
\v 18 Therefore the Youdaiōns answered and said to_him: What sign you_are_showing to_us, that you_are_doing these \add things\add*?
\v 19 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered and said to_them: Destroy this the temple, and I_will_be_raising it in three days.
\v 20 Therefore the Youdaiōns said: This the temple was_built for_forty and six years, and you will_be_raising it in three days?
\v 21 But that \add one\add* was_speaking concerning the temple of_the body of_him.
\v 22 Therefore when he_was_raised from \add the\add*_dead, the apprentices/followers of_him were_reminded that he_was_saying this, and they_believed in_the scripture and the message that the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* spoke.
\v 23 And when he_was in the Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) at the passover_\add feast\add* at the feast, many believed on the name of_him, observing of_him the signs which he_was_doing.
\v 24 But \nd Yaʸsous\nd* himself not was_entrusting himself to_them, because_of that him to_be_knowing all \add men\add*.
\v 25 And that he_was_having no need that anyone may_testify concerning the mankind, because/for he was_knowing what was in the person.

\v 1 And was \add a\add*_man of the Farisaios_\add party\add*, Nikodaʸmos \add the\add*_name to_him, \add a\add*_ruler of_the Youdaiōns, 
\v 2 this \add one\add* came to him by_night, and said to_him: My_great_\add one\add*, we_have_known that you_have_come from \nd god\nd* as_\add a\add*_teacher, because/for no_one is_able to_be_doing these the signs, what you are_doing, if the \nd god\nd* not may_be with him.
\v 3 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered and said to_him: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you, if anyone not may_be_born again, he_is_ not _able to_see the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 4 Nikodaʸmos is_saying to him: How is_ \add a\add*_person _able to_be_born, being old? He_is_ not _able to_come_in into the womb of_the mother of_him secondly and to_be_born?
\v 5 \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answered: Truly, truly, I_am_telling to_you, if anyone not may_be_born of water and of_\nd spirit\nd*, he_is_ not _able to_come_in into the kingdom the of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 6 The \add thing\add* having_been_born of the flesh, is flesh, and the \add thing\add* having_been_born of the \nd spirit\nd*, is spirit.
\v 7 You_may_ not _wonder that I_said to_you: It_is_fitting you_all to_be_born again.
\v 8 The spirit it_is_blowing where is_wanting, and you_are_hearing the sound of_it, but you_have_ not _known from_where it_is_coming, and where it_is_going, thus is everyone which having_been_born of the \nd spirit\nd*.
\v 9 Nikodaʸmos answered and said to_him: How is_ these \add things\add* _able to_become?
\v 10 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered and said to_him: You are the teacher of_ the _Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*), and you_are_ not _knowing these \add things\add*?
\v 11 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you that we_are_speaking what we_have_known, and we_are_testifying what we_have_seen, and you_all_are_ not _receiving the testimony of_us.
\v 12 If I_told the earthly \add things\add* to_you_all, and you_all_are_ not _believing, how you_all_will_be_believing if I_may_tell to_you_all the heavenly \add things\add*?
\v 13 And no_one has_gone_up into the heaven, except not/lest the \add one\add* having_come_down out_of the heaven, the son of_ the _Man.
\v 14 And as Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) exalted the serpent in the wilderness, thus it_is_fitting the son of_ the _man to_be_exalted,
\v 15 in_order_that everyone which believing in him may_be_having eternal life.
\v 16 For/Because thus the \nd god\nd* loved the world, so_that he_gave the the only_begotten son, in_order_that everyone which believing in him may_ not _perish, but may_be_having eternal life.
\v 17 For/Because the \nd god\nd* not sent_out his son into the world, in_order_that he_may_judge the world, but in_order_that the world may_be_saved through him.
\v 18 The \add one\add* believing in him not is_being_judged. But the \add one\add* not believing, has_been_ already _judged, because he_has_ not _believed in the name of_the only_begotten son of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 19 And this is the judgment, that the light has_come into the world, and the people loved the darkness rather than the light, because/for the works of_them was evil.
\v 20 For/Because everyone which doing evil, is_hating the light, and is_ not _coming to the light, in_order_that the works of_him may_be_ not _rebuked.
\v 21 But the \add one\add* practicing the truth, is_coming to the light, in_order_that the works of_him may_be_revealed, that it_is having_been_worked in \nd god\nd*.
\v 22 After these \add things\add* the and \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* the apprentices/followers of_him came into the Judean land, and there he_was_staying with them and was_immersing.
\v 23 And the Yōannaʸs was also immersing in Ainōn near the Saleim, because much water was there, and they_were_arriving and were_being_immersed.
\v 24 For/Because the Yōannaʸs was not_yet having_been_throw into the prison.
\v 25 Therefore became \add a\add*_debate of the apprentices/followers of_Yōannaʸs with \add a\add*_Youdaios about purification.
\v 26 And they_came to the Yōannaʸs and they_said to_him: My_great_\add one\add*, who was with you beyond the Yordanaʸs/(Yardēn), to_whom you have_testified, see, this \add one\add* is_immersing and all are_coming to him.
\v 27 Yōannaʸs answered and said: \add A\add*_person is_ not _able to_be_receiving, not_even one if not it_may_be having_been_given to_him from the heaven.
\v 28 Yourselves you_all are_testifying to_me that I_said: I am not the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, but, that Having_been_sent_out I_am before that \add one\add*.
\v 29 The \add one\add* having the bride, is \add the\add*_bridegroom, but the friend of_the bridegroom, the \add one\add* having_stood and hearing from_him, is_rejoicing with_joy because_of the voice of_the bridegroom. Therefore this the my the joy has_been_fulfilled.
\v 30 That \add one\add* it_is_fitting to_be_increasing, but me to_be_being_made_less.
\v 31 The \add one\add* coming from_above, is above all \add things\add*. The \add one\add* being from the earth, is from the earth, and is_speaking from the earth. The \add one\add* coming from the heaven, is above all \add things\add*.
\v 32 What he_has_seen and heard, this he_is_testifying, but no_one is_receiving the testimony of_him.
\v 33 The \add one\add* having_received of_him the testimony, he_sealed that the \nd god\nd* is true.
\v 34 For/Because whom the \nd god\nd* sent_out, is_speaking the messages of_ the _\nd god\nd*, because/for he_is_giving the \nd spirit\nd* not by measure.
\v 35 The father is_loving the son, and has_given all \add things\add* in the hand of_him.
\v 36 The \add one\add* believing in the son, is_having eternal life, but the \add one\add* disbelieving in_the son, not will_be_seeing life, but the severe_anger of_ the _\nd god\nd* is_remaining on him.

\v 1 Therefore when the \nd master\nd* knew that the Farisaios_\add party\add* heard that \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_making and is_immersing more apprentices/followers than Yōannaʸs
\v 2 (and_yet_indeed \nd Yaʸsous\nd* himself was_ not _immersing, but the apprentices/followers of_him),
\v 3 he_left the Youdaia and went_away again into the Galilaia/(Gālīl).
\v 4 And it_was_fitting him to_be_passing_through through the Samareia/(Shomrōn).
\v 5 Therefore he_is_coming to \add a\add*_city of_ the _Samareia being_called Suⱪar, near the property which Yakōb/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ) gave to_ the _Yōsaʸf/(Yōşēf), the son of_him, 
\v 6 and well of_ the _Yakōb was there. Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_wearied from the journey, was_sitting thus at the well. \add The\add*_hour was about \add the\add*_sixth.
\v 7 \add a\add*_woman out_of the Samareia is_coming to_draw water. The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_her: Give to_me to_drink, 
\v 8 for/because the apprentices/followers of_him had_gone_away into the city, in_order_that they_may_buy food.
\v 9 Therefore the the from_Samareia/(Shomrōn) woman is_saying to_him: How you being \add a\add*_Youdaios, are_requesting to_drink from me of_\add a\add*_woman being from_Samareia/(Shomrōn)? For/Because Youdaiōns are_ not _having_association_with with_Samareitaʸs/(Shomrōn).
\v 10 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered and said to_her: If you_had_known the gift of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and who is which saying to_you: Give to_me to_drink, you would requested him, and he_ would _gave to_you living water.
\v 11 The woman is_saying to_him: Master, neither you_are_having bucket and the well is deep, therefore from_where you_are_having the which living water?
\v 12 You are not greater \add than\add* the father of_us Yakōb, who gave the well to_us, and drank of it himself, and the sons of_him, and the livestock of_him?
\v 13 \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answered and said to_her: Everyone which drinking of the this water, will_be_thirsting again, 
\v 14 but whoever wishfully may_drink of the water that I will_be_giving to_him, by_no_means ˓will˒_ not _be_thirsting, because/for the age, but the water that I_will_be_giving to_him will_be_becoming in him \add a\add*_spring of_water, springing_up into eternal life.
\v 15 The woman is_saying to him: Master, give this the water to_me, in_order_that I_may_ not _be_thirsting, nor I_am_passing_through here to_be_drawing.
\v 16 He_is_saying to_her: Be_going, call the husband of_you and come here.
\v 17 The woman answered and said to_him: I_am_ not _having \add a\add*_husband. The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_her: You_said rightly, that I_am_ not _having \add a\add*_husband, 
\v 18 for/because you_had five husbands, and now he_whom you_are_having, is not husband of_you, this you_have_spoken true.
\v 19 The woman is_saying to_him: Master, I_am_perceiving that you are \add a\add*_prophet.
\v 20 The fathers of_us prostrated on the this mountain, and you_all are_saying that in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) is the place where it_is_fitting to_be_prostrating.
\v 21 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_her: Be_believing in_me, woman, because \add an\add*_hour is_coming, when neither on the this mountain, nor in Hierousalaʸm, ˓will˒_you_all_be_worshipping before_the father.
\v 22 You_all are_prostrating what you_all_have_ not _known, we are_prostrating what we_have_known, because the salvation is of the Youdaiōns.
\v 23 But \add an\add*_hour is_coming and now is, when the true worshipers will_be_worshipping before_the father in spirit and truth, because/for the father also is_seeking such, the \add ones\add* prostrating before_him.
\v 24 The \nd god\nd* \add is\add* \nd spirit\nd*, and the \add ones\add* prostrating before_him it_is_fitting in spirit and truth. to_be_prostrating.
\v 25 The woman is_saying to_him: I_have_known that \add the\add*_chosen_one/messiah is_coming, who \add is\add* being_called \add The\add*_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, whenever that \add one\add* may_come, he_will_be_declaring all \add things\add* to_us.
\v 26 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_saying to_her: I am \add he\add*, the \add one\add* speaking to_you.
\v 27 And after this the apprentices/followers of_him came, and they_were_marvelling that he_was_speaking with \add a\add*_woman, however no_one said: What are_you_seeking? Or: Why are_you_speaking with her?
\v 28 Therefore the woman left the waterpot of_her, and she_went_away into the city, and she_is_saying to_the people,
\v 29 Come, see \add a\add*_man who told to_me all \add things\add* as_much_as I_did, surely_not this is the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*?
\v 30 They_came_out out_of the city, and they_were_coming to him.
\v 31 In the \add time\add* meanwhile the apprentices/followers were_asking him saying: My_great_\add one\add*, eat.
\v 32 But he said to_them: I am_having food to_eat, that you_all have_ not _known.
\v 33 Therefore the apprentices/followers were_saying to one_another: Not anyone brought to_him \add something\add* to_eat?
\v 34 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: My food is that I_may_do the will of_the \add one\add* having_sent me, and I_may_complete the work of_him.
\v 35 Not you_all are_saying, that Still four_month it_is and the harvest is_coming? Behold, I_am_saying to_you_all, lift_up the eyes of_you_all and see the fields, because they_are already white toward harvest.
\v 36 The \add one\add* reaping is_receiving \add a\add*_reward, and is_gathering_together fruit to eternal life, in_order_that the \add one\add* sowing and the \add one\add* reaping may_be_rejoicing together.
\v 37 For/Because the statement in this is the true: that Another \add one\add* is which sowing, and another \add one\add* which reaping.
\v 38 I sent_ you_all _out to_be_reaping what you_all have_ not _laboured, others have_laboured, and you_all have_come_in into the labour of_them.
\v 39 And many of_the Samareitaʸs/(Shomrōn) out_of of_ the that _city, believed on him, because_of the message of_the woman testifying, that He_told to_me all \add things\add* whatever I_did.
\v 40 Therefore when the Samareitaʸs came to him, they_were_asking him to_remain with them, and he_remained there two days.
\v 41 And with_many more believed, because_of the message of_him,
\v 42 to_the and women they_were_saying, that We_are_believing no_longer because_of the your speech, because/for we_have_heard ourselves and we_have_known that this is truly the saviour of_the world.
\v 43 And after the two days, he_came_out from_there into the Galilaia/(Gālīl).
\v 44 For/Because himself \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* testified that \add a\add*_prophet in his own hometown, is_ not _having honour.
\v 45 Therefore When he_came into the Galilaia, the Galilaios received him, having_seen all \add things\add* as_much_as he_did in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) at the feast, because/for they also came to the feast.
\v 46 Therefore he_came again to the Kana of_ the _Galilaia, where he_made the water wine. And was \add a\add*_certain royal \add official\add*, of_whose the son was_ailing in Kafarnaʼoum.
\v 47 This \add one\add* having_heard that \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_coming out_of the Youdaia into the Galilaia, went_away to him, and was_asking that he_may_come_down, and may_heal the son of_him, because/for he_was_going to_be_dying_off.
\v 48 Therefore said the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* to him: If you_all_may_ not _see signs and wonders, you_all_may_ by_no_means not _believe.
\v 49 The royal \add official\add* is_saying to him: Master, come_down before the little_child of_me to_die_off.
\v 50 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him: Be_going, the son of_you is_living. The man believed in_the message which the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_him, and he_was_going.
\v 51 And already of_him coming_down, the slaves of_him met with_him and reported saying that the boy of_him is_living.
\v 52 Therefore he_inquired the hour from them in which he_had better. Therefore they_said to_him, that Yesterday the fever left him at_\add the\add*_ seventh _hour.
\v 53 Therefore the father knew that that \add was\add* at_the hour at which the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_him: The son of_you is_living, and himself and the whole house of_him believed.
\v 54 And this \add is\add* again \add the\add*_second sign the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* did, having_come out_of the Youdaia into the Galilaia/(Gālīl).

\v 1 After these \add things\add* there_was \add a\add*_feast of_the Youdaiōns, and \nd Yaʸsous\nd* went_up to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim).
\v 2 And there_is \add a\add*_pool in the Hierousalaʸm at the sheep_gate, which being_called Baʸthsaida In_Hebraios, having five porticos.
\v 3 In these \add a\add*_multitude of_the \add ones\add* ailing, blind, lame, paralyzed. was_lying,
\v 4
\v 5 And was \add a\add*_certain man there, being thirty eight years in the sicknesses of_him.
\v 6 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_seen this \add one\add* lying_down, and having_known that he_is_ already _having much time, he_is_saying to_him: You_are_wanting healthy to_become?
\v 7 The \add one\add* ailing answered to_him: Master, I_am_ not _having \add a\add*_person, in_order_that whenever the water may_be_disturbed, he_may_put me into the pool, in but which am_coming I, another before me is_coming_down.
\v 8 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him: Be_raising, take_up the pallet of_you, and be_walking.
\v 9 And immediately the man became healthy, and took_up the pallet of_him, and was_walking. And it_was \add the\add*_day_of_rest on that the day.
\v 10 Therefore the Youdaiōns were_saying to_the \add one\add* having_been_healed: It_is \add the\add*_day_of_rest, and it_is_ not _permitting for_you to_take_up the pallet of_you.
\v 11 but \add the\add*_one answered to_them: The \add one\add* having_made me healthy, that \add one\add* said to_me: Take_up the pallet of_you and be_walking.
\v 12 They_asked him: Who is the man which having_said to_you: Take_up and be_walking?
\v 13 But the \add one\add* having_been_healed not had_known who he_is, the for \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* bowed_out, \add a\add*_crowd being in the place.
\v 14 After these \add things\add* the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_finding him in the temple, and he_said to_him: Behold, you_have_become healthy, be_ no_longer _sinning, in_order_that something worse may_ not _become to_you.
\v 15 The man went_away, and declared to_the Youdaiōns that \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is the \add one\add* having_made him healthy.
\v 16 And because_of this, the Youdaiōns were_persecuting the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, because he_was_doing these \add things\add* on \add a\add*_day_of_rest.
\v 17 But he answered to_them: The father of_me is_working until now, and_I am_working.
\v 18 Therefore because_of this, the Youdaiōns were_ more _seeking him to_kill_off, because he_was_ not only _breaking the day_of_rest, but also he_was_calling \nd god\nd* \add his\add*_own father the, making himself equal to_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 19 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered, and was_saying to_them: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, the son is_ not _able to_be_doing nothing of himself, except not/lest anything may_be_seeing the father doing, because/for whatever wishfully that \add one\add* may_be_doing, these \add things\add* also the son likewise is_doing.
\v 20 For/Because the father is_loving the son, and is_showing all \add things\add* to_him which himself is_doing, and he_will_be_showing greater \add than\add* these \add things\add* works to_him, in_order_that you_all may_be_marvelling.
\v 21 For/Because as the father is_raising the dead and is_giving_life, thus also the son, is_giving_life whom is_willing.
\v 22 For/Because and_not the father is_judging no_one, but has_given the all judgment to_the son,
\v 23 in_order_that all may_be_honouring the son, as they_are_honouring the father. The \add one\add* not honouring the son, is_ not _honouring the father, the \add one\add* having_sent him.
\v 24 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that the \add one\add* hearing the message of_me, and believing in_the \add one\add* having_sent me, is_having eternal life, and is_ not _coming into judgment, but has_departed out_of the death into the life.
\v 25 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that \add an\add*_hour is_coming and now is, when the dead will_be_hearing of_the voice of_the son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and the \add ones\add* having_heard will_be_living.
\v 26 For/Because as the father is_having life in himself, thus also he_gave life to_the son to_be_having in himself, 
\v 27 and he_gave authority to_him to_be_executing judgment, because he_is \add the\add*_son of_Man.
\v 28 Be_ not _marvelling at_this, because \add an\add*_hour is_coming in which all the \add ones\add* in the tombs will_be_hearing of_the voice of_him,
\v 29 and the \add ones\add* having_practiced the good \add things\add* they_will_be_going_out, to \add the\add*_resurrection of_life, and the \add ones\add* the having_done evil \add things\add*, to \add the\add*_resurrection of_judgment.
\v 30 I am_ not _being_able to_be_doing nothing of myself, as I_am_hearing, I_am_judging, and the my the judgment is righteous, because I_am_ not _seeking the my the will, but the will of_the \add one\add* having_sent me.
\v 31 If I may_be_testifying concerning myself, the testimony of_me is not true.
\v 32 Another is the \add one\add* testifying concerning me, and I_have_known that the testimony which he_is_testifying concerning me is true.
\v 33 You_all have_sent_out to Yōannaʸs, and he_has_testified to_the truth.
\v 34 But I am_ not _receiving the testimony from human_origin, but these \add things\add* I_am_saying, in_order_that you_all may_be_saved.
\v 35 That \add one\add* was the lamp which being_burned and shining, and you_all willed to_be_exulted for \add a\add*_hour in the light of_him.
\v 36 But I am_having the testimony greater \add than\add* the Yōannaʸs, because/for the works that the father has_given to_me, in_order_that I_may_complete them, the same works which I_am_doing, is_testifying concerning me that the father has_sent_ me _out.
\v 37 And the father having_sent me, that \add one\add* has_testified concerning me. You_all_have_ neither _heard \add the\add*_voice of_him ever, nor have_you_all_seen appearance of_him.
\v 38 And you_all_are_ not _having the message of_him remaining in you_all, because you_all are_ not _believing in_this \add one\add* that \add one\add* whom he_sent_out.
\v 39 You_all_are_searching the scriptures, because you_all are_supposing to_be_having eternal life in them, and those are the \add ones\add* testifying concerning me, 
\v 40 and you_all_are_ not _willing to_come to me, in_order_that you_all_may_be_having life.
\v 41 I_am_ not _receiving glory from humans,
\v 42 but I_have_known that you_all you_all_are_ not _having the love of_ the _\nd god\nd* in yourselves.

\v 44 How are_ you_all _being_able to_believe, receiving glory from one_another, and you_all_are_ not _seeking the glory which \add is\add* from the only? \nd god\nd*?
\v 45 Not be_supposing that I will_be_accusing against_you_all before the father. the \add one\add* accusing against_you_all Is Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh), in whom you_all have_hoped.
\v 46 For/Because if you_all_were_believing in_Mōsaʸs, you_all_were_believing wishfully in_me, because/for that \add one\add* wrote concerning me.

\v 1 After these \add things\add*, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* went_away across the sea of_ the _Galilaia/(Gālīl) of_ the _Tiberios.

\v 3 And \nd Yaʸsous\nd* went_up into the mountain, and he_was_sitting there with the apprentices/followers of_him.
\v 4 And the passover_\add feast\add* was near, the feast of_the Youdaiōns.
\v 5 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_lifted_up his eyes, and having_seen that \add a\add*_great crowd is_coming to him, he_is_saying to Filippos: From_where may_we_buy loaves, in_order_that may_eat these?
\v 6 for/because he_was_saying this testing him, And he had_known what he_was_going to_be_doing.
\v 7 Filippos answered to_him: For/Because_two_hundred daʸnarion_\add coins\add* are_ not _sufficing loaves for_them, that each may_receive little \add thing\add*.
\v 8 one of the apprentices/followers of_him, Andreas the brother of_Simōn Petros Is_saying to_him,
\v 9 Here is \add a\add*_little_boy, who is_having five loaves of_barley and two fish, but what is these for so_many?
\v 10 the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* Said: Make the people to_sit_down. And there_was grass much in the place. Therefore the men sat_down, the number about five_thousand.
\v 11 therefore the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* Took the loaves, and having_given_thanks, he_distributed to_the \add ones\add* reclining, likewise also of the fish, as_much_as they_were_wanting.
\v 12 And when they_were_filled, he_is_saying to_the apprentices/followers of_him: Gather_together the fragments having_been_leftover in_order_that not anything may_lose.
\v 13 Therefore they_gathered_together and they_filled twelve baskets of_fragments from the five the barley loaves, which they_were_leftover to_the \add ones\add* having_eaten.
\v 14 Therefore the people having_seen what signs he_did were_saying, that This is truly the prophet who coming into the world.
\v 15 Therefore \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_known that they_are_going to_be_coming and to_be_snatching him, in_order_that they_may_make \add him\add* king, he_ himself only _withdrew again to the mountain.
\v 16 And when it_became evening, the apprentices/followers of_him came_down to the sea,
\v 17 and having_boarded into \add the\add*_boat, they_were_coming across the sea to Kafarnaʼoum. And darkness already had_become, and the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* had_ not_yet _come to them.
\v 18 And the sea was_being_awoke by_\add a\add*_ great _wind blowing.
\v 19 Therefore having_rowed about twenty five or thirty stadiums, they_are_observing the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* walking on the sea, and becoming near the boat, and they_were_afraid.
\v 20 But he is_saying to_them: I am \add he\add*, be_ not _fearing.
\v 21 Therefore they_were_willing to_receive him into the boat, and immediately the boat became at the land to which they_were_going.
\v 22 On_the_ of_next _\add day\add* the crowd which having_stood across of_the sea, saw that no other little_boat was there except not/lest one, and that the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* not entered_with with_the apprentices/followers of_him into the boat, but only the apprentices/followers of_him went_away, 
\v 23 other boats came from Tiberios, near the place where they_ate the bread, having_ \nd master\nd* the _given_thanks.
\v 24 Therefore when the crowd saw that \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is not there, nor the apprentices/followers of_him, they boarded into the little_boats, and they_came to Kafarnaʼoum seeking the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 25 And having_found him across of_the sea, they_said to_him: My_great_\add one\add*, when have_you_become here?
\v 26 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered to_them and said: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, you_all_are_seeking me, not because you_all_saw signs, but because you_all_ate of the loaves and were_satisfied.
\v 27 Be_ not _working for_the which perishing food, but the food which remaining to eternal life, which the son of_ the _man will_be_giving to_you_all, because/for the \nd god\nd* the father sealed this \add one\add*.
\v 28 Therefore they_said to him: What may_we_be_doing, in_order_that we_may_be_doing the works of_ the _\nd god\nd*?
\v 29 the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* Answered and said to_them: This is the work of_ the _\nd god\nd*, that you_all_may_be_believing in whom that \add one\add* sent_out.
\v 30 Therefore they_said to_him: Therefore what sign are_doing you, in_order_that we_may_see and we_may_believe in_you? What are_you_doing?
\v 31 The fathers of_us ate the manna in the wilderness, as is having_been_written: he_gave bread out_of the heaven to_them to_eat.
\v 32 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_them: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) has_ not _given to_you_all the bread out_of the heaven, but the father of_me is_giving to_you_all the the true bread out_of the heaven.
\v 33 For/Because the bread of_ the _\nd god\nd* is the \add one\add* coming_down out_of the heaven, and giving life to_the world.
\v 34 Therefore they_said to him: Master, always give this the bread to_us.
\v 35 the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_them: I am the bread of_ the _life, the \add one\add* coming to me, by_no_means may_ not _hunger, and the \add one\add* believing in me, by_no_means ˓will˒_ not ever _be_thirsting.
\v 36 But I_said to_you_all that you_all_ both _have_seen me and you_all_are_ not _believing.
\v 37 Everything that the father is_giving to_me, will_be_coming to me, and the \add one\add* coming to me, by_no_means I_may_ not _throw_out out.
\v 38 Because I_have_came_down from the heaven, not in_order_that I_may_be_doing the my the will, but the will of_the \add one\add* having_sent me.
\v 39 And this is the will of_the \add one\add* having_sent me, that everything which he_has_given to_me, I_may_ not _lose of it, but I_will_be_raising_ it _up on_the last day.
\v 40 For/Because this is the will of_the father of_me, that everyone which observing the son and believing in him, may_be_having eternal life, and I will_be_raising_ him _up on_the last day.
\v 41 therefore the Youdaiōns ˓Were˒_grumbling about him, because he_said: I am the bread the \add one\add* having_come_down out_of the heaven.
\v 42 And they_were_saying, is this Not \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* the son of_Yōsaʸf/(Yōşēf), of_whose the father and the mother we have_known? How now is_he_saying, that I_have_came_down out_of the heaven?
\v 43 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* Answered and said to_them: Be_ not _grumbling with one_another.
\v 44 No_one is_able to_come to me, if not the father, the \add one\add* having_sent me, may_draw him, and_I will_be_raising_ him _up the last day.
\v 45 It_is having_been_written in the prophets: And they_will_ all _be taught of_\nd god\nd*. Everyone which having_heard from the father and having_learned, is_coming to me.
\v 46 Not that anyone has_seen the father, except not/lest the \add one\add* being from the \nd god\nd*, this \add one\add* has_seen the father.
\v 47 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, the \add one\add* believing is_having eternal life.
\v 48 I am the bread of_ the _life.
\v 49 The fathers of_you_all ate the manna in the wilderness, and they_died_off.
\v 50 This is the bread which coming_down out_of the heaven, in_order_that anyone may_eat of it, and may_ not _die_off.
\v 51 I am the which living bread which having_come_down out_of the heaven, if anyone may_eat of this the bread, he_will_be_living to the age. The even and bread that I will_be_giving, is the flesh of_me. for the life of_the world.
\v 52 Therefore the Youdaiōns were_quarrelling with one_another saying: How is_ this \add one\add* _able to_give to_us the flesh of_him to_eat?
\v 53 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_them: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, if not you_all_may_eat the flesh of_the son of_ the _Man, and you_all_may_drink of_him the blood, you_all_are_ not _having life in yourselves.
\v 54 The \add one\add* eating the flesh of_me, and drinking the blood of_me, is_having eternal life, and_I will_be_raising_up him at_the last day.
\v 55 For/Because the flesh of_me is true food, and the blood of_me is true drink.
\v 56 The \add one\add* eating the flesh of_me, and drinking the blood of_me, is_remaining in me, and_I in him.
\v 57 As the living father sent_ me _out, and_I am_living because_of the father, also the \add one\add* eating me, and_that \add one\add* will_be_living because_of me.
\v 58 This is the bread which having_come_down from heaven, not as the fathers ate and they_died_off, the \add one\add* eating this the bread will_be_living to the age.
\v 59 He_said these \add things\add* in \add the\add*_synagogue, teaching in Kafarnaʼoum.
\v 60 Therefore many of the apprentices/followers having_heard of_him said, this the message is hard, who is_able to_be_hearing of_it?
\v 61 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_known in himself that the apprentices/followers of_him are_grumbling about this, he_said to_them: This is_offending you_all?
\v 62 Therefore if you_all_may_be_observing the son of_ the _Man, going_up where he_was the earlier?
\v 63 The \nd spirit\nd* is which giving_life, the flesh is_ not _benefiting nothing. The messages which I have_spoken to_you_all is spirit and is life.
\v 64 But there_are some, of you_all who are_ not _believing. For/Because the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* had_known from \add the\add*_beginning, who_all are the \add ones\add* not believing, and who is the \add one\add* going_to_give_ him _over.
\v 65 And he_was_saying: Because_of this I_have_said to_you_all that no_one is_able to_come to me, if may_be having_ not _˓been˒_given to_him from the father.
\v 66 From this many out_of of_the apprentices/followers of_him went_away to the \add things\add* back, and no_longer were_walking with him.
\v 67 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_the twelve: You_all also are_ not _wanting to_be_going_away?
\v 68 Simōn Petros answered to_him: \nd master\nd*, to whom ˓will˒_we_be_going_away? You_are_having \add the\add*_messages eternal of_life.
\v 69 And we have_believed and we_have_known that you are the holy \add one\add* of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 70 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered to_them: Not I chose you_all the twelve, and one of you_all is \add a\add*_devil?
\v 71 And he_was_speaking the to_Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) of_Simōn of_Iskariōtaʸs, because/for this \add one\add* one of the twelve was_going to_be_giving_ him _over.

\v 1 And after these \add things\add*, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_walking in the Galilaia/(Gālīl), because/for he_was_ not _wanting to_be_walking in the Youdaia, because the Youdaiōns were_seeking to_kill_ him _off.
\v 2 And it_was near the feast of_the Youdaiōns the tents.
\v 3 Therefore the brothers of_him said to him: Depart from_here, and be_going into the Youdaia, in_order_that also the apprentices/followers of_you will_be_observing of_you the works that you_are_doing.
\v 4 For/Because no_one is_doing anything in secret and is_seeking himself to_be in public. If you_are_doing these \add things\add*, reveal yourself to_the world.
\v 5 For/Because not_even the brothers of_him were_believing in him.
\v 6 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_saying to_them: - my the time is_ not_yet _coming, but the your the time always is ready.
\v 7 The world is_ not _able to_be_hating you_all, but it_is_hating me, because I am_testifying concerning it that the works of_it is evil.
\v 8 You_all go_up to the feast, I not_yet am_going_up to this the feast, because the my time has_ not_yet _˓been˒_fulfilled.
\v 9 And having_said these \add things\add* to_them he_remained in the Galilaia.
\v 10 But when the brothers of_him went_up to the feast, then he also went_up, not openly, but as in secret.
\v 11 Therefore the Youdaiōns were_seeking him at the feast, and they_were_saying: Where is that \add one\add*?
\v 12 And there_was much grumbling concerning him among the crowds. The \add ones\add* on_one_hand were_saying, that He_is good, on_the_other_hand others were_saying: No, but he_is_deceiving the crowd.
\v 13 No_one however was_speaking in_public concerning him, because_of the fear of_the Youdaiōns.
\v 14 But now being_middle of_the feast, \nd Yaʸsous\nd* went_up into the temple and was_teaching.
\v 15 Therefore the Youdaiōns were_marvelling saying: How has_ this \add one\add* _known letters, not having_learned?
\v 16 Therefore \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answered to_them and said: - my teaching not is mine, but of_the \add one\add* having_sent me.
\v 17 If anyone may_be_wanting to_be_practicing the will of_him, he_will_be_knowing concerning the teaching, whether it_is from the \nd god\nd*, or I am_speaking from myself.
\v 18 The \add one\add* speaking from himself, is_seeking the his own glory, but the \add one\add* seeking the glory of_the \add one\add* having_sent him, this \add one\add* is true, and unrighteousness is not in him.
\v 19 has_ Not Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) _given to_you_all the law, and no_one of you_all is_practicing the law? Why you_all_are_seeking to_kill_ me _off?
\v 20 The crowd answered: You_are_having \add a\add*_demon, who is_seeking to_kill_ you _off?
\v 21 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered and said to_them: I_did one work and you_all_ all _are_marvelling.
\v 22 Because_of this Mōsaʸs has_given to_you_all the circumcision (not that is of the Mōsaʸs, but of the fathers), and on \add the\add*_day_of_rest you_all_are_circumcising \add a\add*_man.
\v 23 If \add a\add*_man is_receiving circumcision on \add the\add*_day_of_rest, in_order_that the law of_Mōsaʸs may_ not _be_broken, you_all_are_angry with_me because I_made \add a\add*_man whole healthy on \add the\add*_day_of_rest?
\v 24 Be_ not _judging according_to appearance, but be_judging the righteous judgment.
\v 25 Therefore some of of_the \add ones\add*_from_Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālam) were_saying: Is not this whom they_are_seeking to_kill_off?
\v 26 And see, he_is_speaking in_public, and are_saying nothing to_him. Perhaps the rulers knew that this truly is the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*?
\v 27 But we_have_known this \add one\add* from_where he_is. But the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* whenever he_may_be_coming, no_one is_knowing from_where he_is.
\v 28 Therefore \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* cried_out the in the temple teaching, and saying: You_all_have_known also_me, and you_all_have_known from_where I_am, and I_have_ not _come of myself, but the \add one\add* having_sent me is true, whom you_all have_ not _known.
\v 29 I have_known him, because I_am from him, and_that \add one\add* sent_ me _out.
\v 30 Therefore they_were_seeking to_arrest him, but no_one laid_on his hand on him, because the hour of_him had_ not_yet _come.
\v 31 The but many of crowd believed in him, and they_were_saying: Whenever the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, may_come, ˓will˒_ not _be_doing more signs \add than\add* which this \add man\add* did?
\v 32 the Farisaios_\add party\add* heard of_the crowd grumbling concerning him these \add things\add*, and sent_out the chief_priests and the Farisaios_\add party\add* attendants, in_order_that they_may_arrest him.
\v 33 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said: I_am still \add a\add*_little time with you_all, and I_am_going to the \add one\add* having_sent me.
\v 34 You_all_will_be_seeking me, and you_all_˓will˒_ not _be_finding, me and where am I you_all, are_ not _being_able to_come.
\v 35 Therefore the Youdaiōns said to themselves: Where is_ this \add one\add* _going to_be_going, that we ˓will˒_ not _be_finding him? He_is_ not _going to_be_going to the dispersion of_the Hellaʸns, and to_be_teaching the Hellaʸns?
\v 36 What is the this message that he_said: You_all_will_be_seeking me, and you_all_˓will˒_ not _be_finding, me and where am I, you_all are_ not _being_able to_come?
\v 37 And at the the great last day of_the feast the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* had_stood, and cried_out saying: If anyone may_be_thirsting, let_him_be_coming to me and let_him_be_drinking.
\v 38 The \add one\add* believing in me, as the scripture said: Rivers of_ living _water will_be_flowing out_of the belly of_him.
\v 39 But he_said this concerning the \nd spirit\nd*, of_whom they_were_going to_be_receiving, the \add ones\add* having_believed on him, because/for \add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd* was not_yet, because \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_glorified not_yet.
\v 40 Therefore the Of crowd, having_heard the of_ these _messages, they_were_saying: This is truly the prophet.
\v 41 Others were_saying: This is the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*. But they were_saying: For/Because the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* is_ not _coming out_of the Galilaia/(Gālīl)?
\v 42 Not the scripture said that the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* is_coming out_of the seed of_Dawid/(Dāvid), and from Baʸthleʼem/(Bēyt-leḩem), the village where Dawid was?
\v 43 Therefore \add a\add*_division became in the crowd because_of him.
\v 44 And some of them were_wanting to_arrest him, but no_one laid their hands on him.
\v 45 Therefore the attendants came to the chief_priests and Farisaios_\add party\add*, and those said to_them: For/Because_reason why you_all_ not _brought him?
\v 46 the attendants answered: \add A\add*_person never spoke thus.
\v 47 Therefore the Farisaios_\add party\add* answered to_them: Not you_all have_been_deceived also?
\v 48 Not anyone of the rulers believed in him, or of the Farisaios_\add party\add*?
\v 49 But the this crowd, which not knowing the law, are accursed.
\v 50 Nikodaʸmos the \add one\add* having_come to him earlier, being one of them Is_saying, to them,
\v 51 Not the law of_us is_judging the person, if not first may_hear from him, and may_know what he_is_doing?
\v 52 They_answered and said to_him: Are not you from the Galilaia also? Search and see that \add a\add*_prophet is_ not _being_raised out_of the Galilaia.

\v 13 Therefore the Farisaios_\add party\add* said to_him: You are_testifying about yourself, the testimony of_you is not true.
\v 14 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered, and said to_them: Even_if I may_be_testifying about myself, the testimony of_me, is true because I_have_known from_where I_came and where I_am_going. But you_all have_ not _known from_where I_am_coming or where I_am_going.
\v 15 You_all are_judging according_to the flesh, I am_ not _judging no_one.
\v 16 but Even if I I_may_be_judging, the my the judgment is true, because I_am not alone, but I and the father having_sent me.
\v 17 The also has_been_written in and the your law, that the testimony of_two men is true.
\v 18 I am the \add one\add* testifying about myself, and the father having_sent me is_testifying about me.

\v 20 He_spoke these the messages in the treasury, teaching in the temple, and no_one arrested him, because the hour of_him had_ not_yet _come.
\v 21 Therefore he_said again to_them: I am_going_away and you_all_will_be_seeking me, and you_all_will_be_dying_off in the sin of_you_all, you_all are_ not _being_able to_come where I am_going.
\v 22 Therefore were_saying the Youdaiōns: Surely_not he_will_be_killing_off himself, that he_is_saying: Where I am_going you_all, not are_being_able to_come?
\v 23 And he_was_saying to_them: You_all are from the \add things\add* below, I am from the \add things\add* above, you_all are of this the world, I am not of the this world.
\v 24 Therefore I_said to_you_all that you_all_will_be_dying_off in the sins of_you_all, because/for if you_all_may_ not _believe that I am \add he\add*, you_all_will_be_dying_off in the sins of_you_all.
\v 25 Therefore they_were_saying to_him: Who are you? The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_them: From_the beginning what something I_am_speaking also to_you_all?
\v 26 I_am_having to_be_speaking And to_be_judging many \add things\add* concerning you_all, but the \add one\add* having_sent me is true, and_ what _I heard from him, I_am_speaking these \add things\add* to the world.
\v 27 They_ not _knew that he_was_speaking to_them about_the father.
\v 28 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_them: Whenever you_all_may_exalt the son of_ the _Man, then you_all_will_be_knowing that I am \add he\add*, and I_am_doing nothing from myself, but as the father taught me, I_am_speaking these \add things\add*.
\v 29 And the \add one\add* having_sent me, is with me, , he_ not _left me alone, because I am_ always _doing the \add things\add* pleasing to_him.
\v 30 Speaking of_him these \add things\add*, many believed on him.
\v 31 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_saying to the Youdaiōns having_believed in_him: If you_all may_remain in the my the message, you_all_are truly apprentices/followers of_me.
\v 32 And you_all_will_be_knowing the truth, and the truth will_be_freeing you_all.
\v 33 They_answered to him: We_are seed of_Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām), and we_have_served to_no_one ever, how are_ you _saying, that You_all_will_be_becoming free?
\v 34 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answered to_them: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that everyone which practicing the sin, is \add a\add*_slave of_ the _sin.
\v 35 And the slave is_ not _remaining in the house to the age, the son is_remaining to the age.
\v 36 Therefore if the son may_free you_all, you_all_will_be really free.
\v 37 I_have_known that you_all_are seed of_Abraʼam, but you_all_are_seeking to_kill_ me _off, because the my the message is_ not _having_room in you_all.
\v 38 I_am_speaking what I have_seen with the father, therefore also you_all you_all_are_doing what you_all_heard with your father.
\v 39 They_answered and said to_him: The father of_us is Abraʼam. The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: If you_all_are children of_ the _Abraʼam, you_all_were_doing the works of_ the _Abraʼam.
\v 40 But now you_all_are_seeking to_kill_ me _off, \add a\add*_man who I_have_spoken the truth to_you_all, that I_heard from the \nd god\nd*, this Abraʼam did not.
\v 41 You_all are_doing the works of_the father of_you_all. therefore they_said to_him: We have_ not _˓been˒_born of sexual_immorality, we_are_having one father, the \nd god\nd*.
\v 42 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_them: If the \nd god\nd* was \add the\add*_father of_you_all, you_all_ would _were_loving me, because/for I came_out from the \nd god\nd* and am_coming, because/for and_not I_have_come of myself, but that \add one\add* sent_ me _out.
\v 43 for/because_ Why _reason you_all_are_ not _knowing the my the speech? Because you_all_are_ not _being_able to_be_hearing the my the message.
\v 44 You_all are of the father the devil, and you_all_are_wanting to_be_doing the desires of_the father of_you_all. That \add one\add* was \add a\add*_murderer from \add the\add*_beginning, and has_ not _stood in the truth, because truth is not in him.

\v 45 But I because I_am_speaking the truth, you_all_are_ not _believing in_me. 
\v 46 Which of you_all is_rebuking me concerning sin? If I_am_speaking \add the\add*_truth, because/for_ why _reason you_all are_ not _believing in_me?
\v 47 The \add one\add* being of the \nd god\nd*, is_hearing the messages of_ the _\nd god\nd*, because_of this you_all are_ not _hearing, because you_all_are not of the \nd god\nd*.
\v 48 The Youdaiōns answered and said to_him, are_ we not rightly _saying that you are \add a\add*_from_Samareia/(Shomrōn), and you_are_having \add a\add*_demon?
\v 49 \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answered: I am_ not _having \add a\add*_demon, but I_am_honouring the father of_me, and you_all are_dishonouring me.
\v 50 But I am_ not _seeking the glory of_me, he_is the \add one\add* seeking and judging.
\v 51 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, if anyone may_keep the my message, by_no_means he_may_ not _observe death to the age.
\v 52 The Youdaiōns said to_him: Now we_have_known that you_are_having \add a\add*_demon. Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām) died_off and the prophets, and you are_saying: If anyone may_keep the message of_me, by_no_means he_may_ not _taste of_death to the age.
\v 53 You are not greater \add than\add* Abraʼam the father of_us, who died_off? Also the prophets died_off. Whom you_are_making yourself?
\v 54 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered: If I may_glorify myself, the glory of_me is nothing, the father of_me is the \add one\add* glorifying me, of_whom you_all are_saying, that He_is \nd god\nd* of_us,
\v 55 and you_all_have_ not _known him, but I have_known him, and_if I_may_say that I_have_ not _known him, I_will_be \add a\add*_liar similar to_you_all. But I_have_known him, and I_am_keeping the message of_him.
\v 56 Abraʼam the father of_you_all exulted, that he_may_see the my the day, and he_saw \add it\add* and was_elated.
\v 57 Therefore the Youdaiōns said to him, you_are_ not_yet _having fifty years, and you_have_seen? Abraʼam
\v 58 \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_them: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, before Abraʼam to_become, I am.

\v 3 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered: Neither this \add man\add* sinned, nor the parents of_him.\f + \fr 9:3 \ft Traditionally, most translations have placed a comma here (which is also a good possibility—remember that the original Greek manuscripts contain no punctuation), but this interpretation is equally valid and perhaps gives a more acceptable interpretation.\f* But in_order_that the works of_ the _\nd god\nd* may_be_revealed in him,
\v 4 It_is_fitting us to_be_working the works of_the \add one\add* having_sent me, until it_is day, night is_coming, when no_one is_able to_be_working.
\v 5 Whenever I_may_be in the world, I_am \add the\add*_light of_the world.
\v 6 Having_said these \add things\add*, he_spat on_the_ground and made clay of the spittle, and he_spread_on the clay of_him to his eyes.
\v 7 And he_said to_him: Be_going, wash in the pool of_ the _Silōam (which is_being_translated: Having_been_sent_out). Therefore he_went_away and washed, and came seeing.

\v 9 Others were_saying, that This he_is, others were_saying: No, but he_is similar to_him. That \add one\add* was_saying, that I am \add he\add*.
\v 10 Therefore they_were_saying to_him: How were_ the eyes of_you _opened_up?
\v 11 That \add one\add* answered, Man which being_called \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* made clay, and spread_on the eyes of_me, and said to_me, that Be_going to the Silōam and wash. Having_gone_away therefore and having_washed, I_received_sight.

\v 14 And it_was \add the\add*_day_of_rest in which day the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* made the clay, and opened_up the eyes of_him.

\v 17 Therefore they_are_saying again to_the blind \add man\add*: What are_ you _saying about him, because he_opened_up the eyes of_you? And he said, that He_is \add a\add*_prophet.
\v 18 Therefore the Youdaiōns not believed him concerning that he_was blind and received_sight, until they_called the parents of_him of_which which having_received_sight.
\v 19 And they_asked them saying: This is the son of_you_all, whom you_all are_saying that he_was_born blind? Therefore how he_is_seeing now?
\v 20 Therefore the parents of_him answered and said: We_have_known that this is the son of_us, and that he_was_born blind.
\v 21 But how he_is_seeing now, we_have_ not _known, or who opened_up the eyes of_him, we have_ not _known, ask him, he he_is_having age, he will_be_speaking about himself.
\v 22 The Parents of_him said these \add things\add*, because they_were_fearing the Youdaiōns, because/for already the Youdaiōns had_decided that if anyone may_confess him \add the\add*_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, he_may_become excommunicated.

\v 1 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, the \add one\add* not coming_in by the door, to the field of_the sheep, but going_up another_way, that \add one\add* is \add a\add*_thief and \add a\add*_robber.
\v 2 But the \add one\add* coming_in by the door, is shepherd of_the sheep.
\v 3 To_this \add one\add* the doorkeeper is_opening_up, and the sheep is_hearing of_the voice of_him, and he_is_calling his own sheep by name, and is_leading_ them _out.
\v 4 Whenever he_may_send_forth all his own, he_is_going before them, and the sheep is_following after_him, because they_have_known the voice of_him.
\v 5 And by_no_means they_may_ not _follow after_\add a\add*_stranger, but they_will_be_fleeing from him, because they_have_ not _known the voice of_ the _strangers.

\v 9 I am the door, if anyone may_come_in by me he_will_be_being_saved, and will_be_coming_in, and will_be_coming_out, and will_be_finding pasture.
\v 10 The thief is_ not _coming, except not/lest in_order_that he_may_steal, and may_sacrifice, and may_destroy. I came, in_order_that they_may_be_having life, and they_may_be_having \add it\add* abundantly.
\v 11 I am the the good shepherd. The the good shepherd is_laying the life of_him for the sheep.
\v 12 The hired_hand even not being \add the\add*_shepherd, of_whose sheep is not his own, is_observing the wolf coming, and is_leaving the sheep and is_fleeing, and the wolf is_snatching and is_scattering them,

\v 14 I am the the good shepherd, and I_am_knowing the mine, and mine are_knowing me the,

\v 17 Because_of this, the father is_loving me, because I am_laying the life of_me, in_order_that again I_may_take it.
\v 18 No_one took_up it from me, but I am_laying it of myself. I_am_having authority to_lay it, and I_am_having authority again to_take it. I_received this the command from the father of_me.
\v 19 \add A\add*_division again became among the Youdaiōns, because_of the these messages.

\v 27 The my the sheep are_hearing of_the voice of_me, and_I I_am_knowing them, and they_are_following after_me,
\v 28 and_I am_giving eternal life to_them, and by_no_means they_may_ not _perish, because/for the age, and anyone will_be_ not _snatching them out_of the hand of_me.
\v 29 The father of_me who has_given \add them\add* to_me, is greater \add than\add* all \add things\add*, and no_one is_able to_be_snatching out_of the hand of_the father.
\v 30 I and the father one are.
\v 31 The Youdaiōns bore again stones, in_order_that they_may_stone him.
\v 32 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered to_them: I_showed many good works to_you_all from the father, of_me because_of which work of_them, are_you_all_stoning me?
\v 33 The Youdaiōns answered to_him: We_are_ not _stoning you for \add a\add*_good work, but for slander, and because you, \add a\add*_human being, are_making yourself \nd god\nd*.
\v 34 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answered to_them: Is_it not having_been_written in the law of_you_all, that I said: You_all_are gods?
\v 35 If he_called those gods, to whom the message of_ the _\nd god\nd* became (and not is_able to_be_broken the scripture),
\v 36 are_ you_all _saying whom the father sanctified and sent_out into the world, that You_are_slandering, because I_said: I_am \add the\add*_son of_ the _\nd god\nd*?
\v 37 If I_am_ not _doing the works of_the father of_me, be_ not _believing in_me, 
\v 38 but if I_am_doing, even_if in_me you_all_may_be_ not _believing, be_believing in_the works, in_order_that you_all_may_know and you_all_may_be_knowing that the father in me \add is\add*, and_I \add am\add* in the father.
\v 39 Therefore they_were_seeking again to_arrest him, but he_came_out out_of the hand of_them.
\v 40 And he_went_away again beyond the Yordanaʸs/(Yardēn), to the place where was Yōannaʸs which before immersing, and he_remained there.
\v 41 And many came to him, and they_were_saying, that Yōannaʸs on_one_hand did not_one sign, on_the_other_hand all \add things\add* as_much_as Yōannaʸs said concerning this \add man\add* was true.
\v 42 And many believed in him there.

\v 1 And \add a\add*_certain \add man\add* was ailing, Lazaros of Baʸthania of the village of_Maria/(Miryām), and Martha the sister of_her.
\v 2 And Maria was the \add woman\add* having_anointed the \nd master\nd* with_ointment, and having_wiped_off the feet of_him with_the hairs of_her, whose the brother Lazaros was_ailing.
\v 3 Therefore the sisters sent_out to him saying: \nd master\nd*, see, he_whom you_are_loving is_ailing.
\v 4 But having_heard the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said: This the sickness not is to death, but for the glory of_ the _\nd god\nd*, in_order_that the son of_ the _\nd god\nd* may_be_glorified by it.
\v 5 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_loving the Martha, and the sister of_her, and the Lazaros.
\v 6 Therefore when he_heard that he_is_ailing, then indeed he_remained in \add the\add*_place which he_was two days.
\v 7 Then after this he_is_saying to_the apprentices/followers: We_may_be_going into the Youdaia again.
\v 8 The Disciples are_saying to_him: My_great_\add one\add*, the Youdaiōns were_seeking now to_stone you, and you_are_going there again?
\v 9 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered are not Twelve, hours of_the day? If anyone may_be_walking in the day, he_is_ not _stumbling, because he_is_seeing the light of_ the this _world.
\v 10 But if anyone may_be_walking in the night, he_is_stumbling, because the light is not in him.
\v 11 He_said these \add things\add*, and after this he_is_saying to_them: Lazaros the \add the\add*_friend of_us has_been_fallen_asleep, but I_am_going, in_order_that I_may_awaken him.
\v 12 Therefore the apprentices/followers said to_him: \nd master\nd*, if he_has_been_fallen_asleep he_will_be_being_healed.
\v 13 But the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* had_spoken about the death of_him. But those supposed that he_is_speaking about the sleep of_ the _sleep.
\v 14 Therefore then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_them with_plainness: Lazaros died_off,
\v 15 and I_am_rejoicing because_of you_all, that not I_was there in_order_that you_all_may_believe, but we_may_be_going to him.
\v 16 Therefore Thōmas which being_called Didumos/[twin] said, to_the fellow-apprentices/followers: May_be_ we _going also, in_order_that we_may_die_off with him.
\v 17 Therefore having_come the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* found him, having already four days. in the tomb.
\v 18 And Baʸthania was near the Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), from about fifteen stadiums.
\v 19 And many of the Youdaiōns had_come to the Martha and Maria/(Miryām), in_order_that they_may_console them concerning their brother.
\v 20 Therefore the Martha when, she_heard that \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_coming, met with_him, But Maria was_sitting in the house.
\v 21 Therefore the Martha said to the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*: \nd master\nd*, if you_were here, the brother of_me would not died_off.
\v 22 also now I_have_known that as_much_as wishfully you_may_request the \nd god\nd*, the \nd god\nd* will_be_giving to_you.
\v 23 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_her, the brother of_you Will_be_rising_up.
\v 24 Martha is_saying to_him: I_have_known that he_will_be_rising_up in the resurrection at the last day.
\v 25 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_her: I am the resurrection and the life, the \add one\add* believing in me, even_if he_may_die_off, will_be_living,
\v 26 and everyone which living and believing in me, by_no_means may_ not _die_off to the age. Are_you_believing this?
\v 27 She_is_saying to_him: Yes, \nd master\nd*, I have_believed that you are the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, the son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, the \add one\add* coming into the world.
\v 28 And having_said this she_went_away, and called Maria, the sister of_her secretly, having_said: The teacher is_coming, and he_is_calling you.
\v 29 And that \add woman\add* when she_heard, she_was_raised quickly and was_coming to him.
\v 30 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* had_ not_yet _come into the village, but was still at the place where the Martha met with_him.
\v 31 Therefore the Youdaiōns which being with her in the house and consoling her, having_seen that the Maria/(Miryām) quickly she_rose_up and came_out, they_followed after_her, having_supposed that she_is_going to the tomb, in_order_that she_may_weep there.
\v 32 Therefore the Maria, when she_came where \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was, having_seen him, fell of_him at his feet, saying to_him, \nd master\nd*, if you_were here, the brother wishfully of_me not died_off.
\v 33 Therefore \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* when he_saw her weeping, and the \add ones\add* Youdaiōns having_come_together to_her weeping, he_groaned in_the spirit and disturbed himself.
\v 34 And he_said: Where have_you_all_laid him? They_are_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, be_coming and see.
\v 35 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* wept.
\v 36 Therefore the Youdaiōns were_saying: Behold, how he_was_loving him. 
\v 37 But some of them said: This \add man\add* the \add one\add* having_opened_up the eyes of_the blind \add man\add* was_ not _able, to_ also _make that this \add one\add* may_ not _die_off?
\v 38 Therefore \nd Yaʸsous\nd* again groaning in himself, is_coming to the tomb. And it_was \add a\add*_cave, and \add a\add*_stone was_laying_on against it.
\v 39 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying: Take_away the stone. Martha the \add the\add*_sister of_the \add one\add* having_died is_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, he_is_ already _stinking, because/for it_is \add the\add*_fourth_day.
\v 40 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_her: Not I_said to_you that if you_may_believe, you_will_be_seeing the glory of_ the _\nd god\nd*?
\v 41 Therefore they_took_away the stone. And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* lifted_up his eyes upward, and said: father, I_am_giving_thanks to_you that you_heard from_me.
\v 42 And I had_known that always you_are_hearing from_me, but because_of the crowd which having_stood_around, I_said \add it\add*, in_order_that they_may_believe that you sent_ me _out.
\v 43 And having_said these \add things\add*, with_\add a\add*_ loud _voice he_cried_out: Lazaros, come out.
\v 44 the \add one\add* having_died Came_out, his feet and his hands having_been_bound with_linen_strips, and the face of_him had_been_bound_about. with_\add a\add*_handkerchief. The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_saying to_them: Release him and allow him to_be_going.
\v 45 Therefore many of the Youdaiōns, which having_come to the Maria/(Miryām), and having_seen what he_did, they_believed in him.
\v 46 But some of them went_away to the Farisaios_\add party\add*, and told to_them what \nd Yaʸsous\nd* did.
\v 47 Therefore the chief_priests and the Farisaios_\add party\add* gathered_together \add the\add*_council, and they_were_saying: What are_we_doing, because this the man is_doing many signs?
\v 48 If we_may_allow him thus, all will_be_believing in him, and the Ɽōmaios will_be_coming, and they_will_be_taking_away of_us both the place and the nation.
\v 49 But \add a\add*_ one _certain of them, Kaiafas being chief_priest the year that, said to_them: You_all have_ not _known nothing. 
\v 50 Nor you_all_are_counting that it_is_benefitting for_you_all that one man may_die_off for the people, and not all the nation may_perish.
\v 51 And he_said this not from himself, but being chief_priest the that year, he_prophesied that \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_going to_be_dying_off for the nation,
\v 52 and not only for the nation, but in_order_that also the children of_ the _\nd god\nd*, the \add ones\add* having_been_scattered may_gather_together into one.
\v 53 Therefore from that the day, they_counselled that they_may_kill_ him _off.
\v 54 therefore The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* no_longer was_walking in_public among the Youdaiōns, but went_away from_there into the region near the wilderness, to \add a\add*_city being_called Ephraim, and_there he_remained with the apprentices/followers.
\v 55 And the passover_\add feast\add* of_the Youdaiōns was near, and many went_up to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) out_of the region before the passover_\add feast\add*, in_order_that they_may_purify themselves.
\v 56 Therefore they_were_seeking the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, and they_were_saying with one_another having_stood in the temple: What it_is_supposing to_you_all? That by_no_means he_may_ not _come to the feast?
\v 57 And had_given the chief_priests and the Farisaios_\add party\add* commands, that if anyone may_know where he_is, he_may_divulge \add it\add*, so_that they_may_arrest him.

\v 1 Therefore the Six days before the passover_\add feast\add* \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, came to Baʸthania, where Lazaros was, whom \nd Yaʸsous\nd* raised from \add the\add*_dead.
\v 2 Therefore they_made \add a\add*_supper for_him there, and the Martha was_serving, and the Lazaros was one of the \add ones\add* reclining with him.
\v 3 Therefore the Maria/(Miryām) having_taken \add a\add*_litra_\add weight\add* of_ointment of_ precious genuine _nard, anointed the feet of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd*, and wiped_off the feet of_him with_the hairs of_her, and the house was_filled with the aroma of_the ointment.
\v 4 But Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) the Iskariōtaʸs, one of_the apprentices/followers of_him, the \add one\add* going to_be_giving_ him _over, is_saying,
\v 5 for/because_ Why _reason this the ointment was_ not _sold for/because_three_hundred daʸnarion_\add coins\add*, and was_given to_\add the\add*_poor?
\v 6 But he_said this, not that was_caring to_him for the poor, but because he_was \add a\add*_thief, and having the moneybag was_bearing the \add money\add* being_thrown \add in\add*.
\v 7 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said: Allow her, in_order_that she_may_keep it for the day of_the burial of_me.
\v 8 For/Because you_all_are_ always _having the poor with yourselves, but you_all_are_ not always _having me.
\v 9 Therefore the \add a\add*_ great _crowd of the Youdaiōns knew that he_is there, and they_came, not only because_of the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, but in_order_that they_may_ also _see the Lazaros, whom he_raised from \add the\add*_dead.
\v 10 But the chief_priests counselled that they_may_kill_off the Lazaros also,
\v 11 because many of_the Youdaiōns were_going_away because_of him, and they_were_believing in the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 12 On_the \add day\add* of_next the great crowd, the \add one\add* having_come to the feast, having_heard that the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_coming into Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim),
\v 13 they_took the palm_branches of_the palm_trees and came_out in meeting to_him, and they_were_crying_out: Honoured_saviour. Having_been_blessed \add is\add* the \add one\add* coming in \add the\add*_name of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, and the king of_ the _Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*). 
\v 14 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_found \add a\add*_little_donkey, sat_down on it, as is having_been_written,
\v 15 Be_ not _fearing, daughter of_Siōn/(Tsiyyōn), see, the king of_you is_coming, sitting on \add a\add*_colt of_\add a\add*_donkey.
\v 16 The Disciples of_him not knew these \add things\add* from_the first, but when \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* was_glorified, then they_were_reminded that these \add things\add* was having_been_written concerning him, and they_did these \add things\add* to_him.
\v 17 Therefore the crowd was_testifying which being with him, when he_called the Lazaros out_of the tomb, and raised him from \add the\add*_dead.
\v 18 Because_of this the crowd also met with_him, because they_heard about_him to_have_done the this sign.
\v 19 Therefore the Farisaios_\add party\add* said to themselves: You_all_are_observing that you_all_are_ not _benefiting nothing, see, the world went_away after him.
\v 20 And Hellaʸns were some of the \add ones\add* going_up, in_order_that they_may_prostrate at the feast, 
\v 21 therefore these approached to_Filippos, who from Baʸthsaida of_ the _Galilaia/(Gālīl), and they_were_asking him saying: Master, we_are_wanting to_see the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 22 The Filippos is_coming and he_is_telling to_ the _Andreas, Andreas and Filippos is_coming and they_are_telling to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 23 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_answering to_them saying: The hour has_come, in_order_that the son of_ the _man may_be_glorified.
\v 24 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, if the seed of_ the _wheat may_ not _die_off having_fallen into the ground, only it is_remaining, but if it_may_die_off, it_is_bearing much fruit.
\v 25 The \add one\add* loving the life of_him, is_losing it, and the \add one\add* hating the life of_him in the this world, will_be_keeping it to eternal life.
\v 26 If anyone may_be_serving unto_me, him _let_be_following after_me, and where am I, there also the the my servant will_be. If anyone may_be_serving unto_me, the father will_be_honouring him.
\v 27 Now the soul of_me has_been_disturbed, and what may_I_say: father, save me from the this hour? But because_of this, I_came to the this hour.
\v 28 father, glorify the name of_you. Therefore \add a\add*_voice came out_of the heaven: Both I_glorified \add it\add*, and I_will_be_glorifying \add it\add* again.
\v 29 Therefore the crowd which having_stood and having_heard, was_saying thunder to_have_become. Others were_saying: \add An\add*_messenger has_spoken to_him.
\v 30 \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answered and said, this the voice has_become not because_of me, but because_of you_all.
\v 31 Now is \add the\add*_judgment of_ the this _world, now the ruler of_ the this _world will_be_being_thrown_out out.
\v 32 And_I if may_be_exalted from the earth, I_will_be_drawing all to myself.
\v 33 But he_was_saying this, signifying by_what death he_was_going to_be_dying_off.
\v 34 Therefore the crowd answered to_him: We heard out_of the law that the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* is_remaining to the age, and how are_saying you that it_is_fitting the son of_ the _man to_be_exalted? Who is this the son of_ the _Man?
\v 35 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_them: The light is with you_all still \add a\add*_little time. be_walking while you_all_are_having the light, in_order_that you_all may_ not _grasp darkness, and the \add one\add* walking in the darkness, has_ not _known where he_is_going.
\v 36 While you_all_are_having the light, be_believing in the light, in_order_that you_all_may_become sons of_light. \nd Yaʸsous\nd* spoke these \add things\add*, and having_gone_away, was_hidden from them.
\v 37 But having_done so_many signs of_him before them, they_were_ not _believing in him,
\v 38 in_order_that the message of_Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊ\sup yāh\sup*) the prophet may_be_fulfilled that he_said: \nd master\nd*, who believed in_the report of_us? And to_whom was_revealed the arm of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd*?
\v 39 Because_of this they_were_ not _able to_be_believing, because again Aʸsaias said,
\v 40 He_has_blinded the eyes of_them and he_maimed the heart of_them, in_order_that they_may_ not _see with_their eyes and they_may_understand with_their heart, and they_may_be_turned and I_will_be_healing them.
\v 41 Aʸsaias said these \add things\add*, because he_saw the glory of_him, and spoke concerning him.
\v 42 Likewise however even many from of_the rulers believed in him, but because_of the Farisaios_\add party\add* they_were_ not _confessing, in_order_that they_ not _may_become excommunicated.
\v 43 For/Because they_loved the glory of_ the _humans more than the glory of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 44 and \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* cried_out and said: The \add one\add* believing in me, is_ not _believing in me, but in the \add one\add* having_sent me,
\v 45 and the \add one\add* observing me, is_observing the \add one\add* having_sent me.
\v 46 I have_come into the world as_\add a\add*_light, in_order_that everyone which believing in me, in the darkness may_ not _remain.
\v 47 And if anyone may_hear of_the messages of_me, and not may_keep \add them\add*, I am_ not _judging him, because/for I_came not, in_order_that I_may_judge the world, but in_order_that I_may_save the world.
\v 48 The \add one\add* rejecting me and not receiving the messages of_me, is_having the \add one\add* judging him, the message which I_spoke, that will_be_judging him at the last day.
\v 49 Because I spoke not from myself, but the father himself having_sent me to_me has_given \add a\add*_command, what I_may_say, and what I_may_speak.
\v 50 And I_have_known that the command of_him is eternal life. Therefore what I am_speaking, as the father has_said to_me, thus I_am_speaking.

\v 1 And before the feast of_the passover_\add feast\add*, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_known that the hour of_him came, that he_may_depart out_of the this world to the father, having_loved his own who \add were\add* in the world, he_loved them to \add the\add*_end.
\v 2 And becoming, supper, the devil already having_put into the heart Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) of_Simōn Iskariōtaʸs that may_give_ him _over,
\v 3 having_known that the father has_given all \add things\add* to_him, into his hands, and that he_came_out from \nd god\nd* and he_is_going to the \nd god\nd*,
\v 4 he_is_being_raised from the supper and is_laying \add aside\add* his clothes, and having_taken \add a\add*_linen_towel he_girded himself.
\v 5 Thereafter he_is_putting water into the wash_basin, and began to_be_washing the feet of_the apprentices/followers, and to_be_wiping_off \add them\add* with_the linen_towel with_which he_was having_been_girded.
\v 6 Therefore he_is_coming to Simōn Petros. He_is_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, are_ you _washing the feet of_me?
\v 7 \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answered and said to_him: What I am_doing, you you_have_ not _known now, but you_will_be_knowing after these \add things\add*.
\v 8 Petros is_saying to_him: By_no_means you_may_ not _wash the feet of_me to the age. \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered to_him: If I_may_ not _wash you, are_ not _having part with me.
\v 9 Simōn Petros is_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, not only the feet of_me, but also my hands and my head.
\v 10 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him: The \add one\add* having_been_washed is_ not _having need, except to_wash not/lest the feet, but he_is all clean, and you_all are clean, but not all.
\v 11 For/Because he_had_known the \add one\add* giving_ him _over, because_of this he_said, that You_all_are not all clean.
\v 12 Therefore when he_washed the feet of_them, and took the clothes of_him, and sat_down, again he_said to_them: Are_you_all_knowing what I_have_done to_you_all?
\v 13 You_all are_calling me the Teacher and, the \nd master\nd*, and you_all_are_saying rightly, because/for I_am.
\v 14 Therefore if I the \nd master\nd* and the Teacher washed the feet of_you_all, you_all also are_ought to_be_washing the feet of_one_another.
\v 15 For/Because I_gave to_you_all \add an\add*_example that as I did to_you_all, you_all also may_be_doing.
\v 16 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, is not \add a\add*_slave greater \add than\add* the master of_him, nor \add an\add*_ambassador greater \add than\add* the \add one\add* having_sent him.
\v 17 If you_all_have_known these \add things\add*, you_all_are blessed if you_all_may_be_doing them.
\v 18 I_am_speaking not about all of_you. I have_known whom_all I_chose, but in_order_that the scripture may_be_fulfilled: The \add one\add* eating the bread with me, lifted_up the heel of_him against me.
\v 19 From now I_am_telling to_you_all before the \add time\add* to_become, in_order_that you_all_may_believe whenever it_may_become that I am \add he\add*.
\v 20 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, the \add one\add* receiving wishfully anyone I_may_send, is_receiving me, and the \add one\add* receiving me, is_receiving the \add one\add* having_sent me.
\v 21 Having_said these \add things\add*, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* was_disturbed the in_spirit and testified and said: Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that one of you_all will_be_giving_ me _over.
\v 22 Therefore the apprentices/followers were_looking among one_another, perplexing about whom he_is_speaking.
\v 23 And one out_of the apprentices/followers whom the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_loving was reclining in the bosom of_him of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 24 Therefore Simōn Petros is_nodding to_this \add one\add*, to_inquire who wishfully it_might_be about whom he_is_speaking.

\v 11 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_ the _Petros: Put the sword into the sheath, the cup which the father has_given to_me, by_no_means I_may_ not _drink it?
\v 12 Therefore the cohort, and the commander, and the attendants of_the Youdaiōns, captured the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* and bound him.
\v 13 And they_led \add him\add* to Annas first, because/for he_was father_in_law of_ the _Kaiafas, who was chief_priest of_ the that _year.
\v 14 And Kaiafas was the \add one\add* having_counselled to_the Youdaiōns that it_is_benefitting for_one man to_die_off for the people.
\v 15 And Simōn Petros and \add the\add*_other apprentice/follower was_following. the with_\nd Yaʸsous\nd*. And the that apprentice/follower was known to_the chief_priest, and he_entered_with the with_\nd Yaʸsous\nd* into the courtyard of_the chief_priest.
\v 16 But the Petros had_stood at the door outside. Therefore the the other apprentice/follower came_out which was known of_the chief_priest, and he_spoke to_the doorkeeper and brought_in the Petros.
\v 17 The servant_girl the doorkeeper is_saying therefore, to_ the _Petros: Are you not also of the apprentices/followers of_ the this _man? That \add one\add* he_is_saying: I_am not.
\v 18 And the slaves and the attendants had_stood, having_made \add a\add*_charcoal_fire, because it_was cold, and they_were_warming \add themselves\add*, and the Petros was also with them having_stood and warming \add himself\add*.
\v 19 Therefore the chief_priest asked the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* concerning the apprentices/followers of_him, and concerning the teaching of_him.
\v 20 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered to_him: I have_spoken with_plainness to_the world, I always taught in \add the\add*_synagogue and in the temple, where all the Youdaiōns are_coming_together, and I_spoke nothing in secret.
\v 21 Why are_you_asking me? Ask the \add ones\add* having_heard what I_spoke to_them, see, these have_known what I said.
\v 22 And these \add things\add* of_him having_said, one of_the \add ones\add* attendants having_stood_by gave \add a\add*_slap to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_said: Are_you_answering thus to_the chief_priest?
\v 23 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered to_him: If I_spoke wrongly, testify concerning the evil, but if rightly, why are_you_beating me?
\v 24 Therefore the Annas sent_ him _out, having_been_bound to Kaiafas the chief_priest.
\v 25 And Simōn Petros was having_stood and warming \add himself\add*. Therefore they_said to_him: Are not you also of the apprentices/followers of_him? That \add one\add* he_disowned and said: I_am not.
\v 26 one of the slaves of_the chief_priest, being \add a\add*_relative of_whom Petros cut_off his ear Is_saying: Not I saw you in the garden with him?
\v 27 Therefore again Petros disowned, and immediately \add a\add*_rooster crowed.
\v 28 Therefore they_are_leading the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* from the Kaiafas into the residence_of_the_governor, and it_was early. And they not came_in into the residence_of_the_governor, in_order_that they_may_ not _be_defiled, but they_may_eat the passover_\add feast\add*.
\v 29 Therefore the Pilatos came_out outside to them and is_saying: What accusation are_you_all_bringing against this the man?
\v 30 They_answered and said to_him: Except not/lest this \add one\add* was doing evil, we_ would not _gave_over him to_you
\v 31 Therefore Pilatos said to_them: You_all take him, and judge according_to the law of_you_all, him. The Youdaiōns said to_him, is_ not _permitting To_us to_kill_off no_one, 
\v 32 in_order_that the message of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd* may_be_fulfilled, that he_spoke, signifying by_what death he_was_going to_be_dying_off.
\v 33 Therefore the Pilatos came_in again into the residence_of_the_governor, and he_called the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* and said to_him: Are you the king of_the Youdaiōns?
\v 34 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered Are_ you _saying this of yourself, or others said \add it\add* to_you concerning me?
\v 35 The Pilatos answered: Surely_not am I \add a\add*_Youdaios? The Your the nation and the chief_priests gave_ you _over to_me. What did_you?
\v 36 \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answered: - my the kingdom is not of the world this, if the my the kingdom was of this the world, the my the attendants would were_fighting, in_order_that I_may_ not _be_given_over to_the Youdaiōns. But now the my the kingdom is not from_here.
\v 37 Therefore the Pilatos said to_him: Are you not_then \add a\add*_king? The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered: You are_saying that I am \add a\add*_king. for this I_have_been_born, and for this I_have_come into the world, in_order_that I_may_testify to_the truth. Everyone which being of the truth, is_hearing of_the voice of_me.
\v 38 The Pilatos is_saying to_him: What is truth? And having_said this, he_came_out again to the Youdaiōns, and is_saying to_them: I am_finding not_one Guilt in him.
\v 39 But it_is \add a\add*_custom with_you_all, that I_may_send_away one to_you_all at the passover_\add feast\add*, therefore are_you_all_wishing I_may_send_away to_you_all the king of_the Youdaiōns?
\v 40 Therefore they_cried_out again saying: Not this \add one\add*, but the Barabbas. And the Barabbas was \add a\add*_robber.
\c 19
\nb
\v 1 Therefore the Pilatos then took the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* and flogged \add him\add*.
\v 2 And the soldiers having_twisted_together \add a\add*_crown of thorns, they_put_on \add it\add* on_the head of_him, and they_clothed him in_\add a\add*_ purple _robe,
\v 3 and they_were_coming to him and they_were_saying: Greetings, the king of_the Youdaiōns. And they_were_giving slaps to_him.
\v 4 And the Pilatos came_out again outside, and is_saying to_them: Behold, I_am_bringing him out to_you_all, in_order_that you_all_may_know that I_am_ not _finding guilt in him.
\v 5 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* came_out outside, wearing the thorny crown and the purple robe. And he_is_saying to_them: Behold, the man. 
\v 6 Therefore when the chief_priests and the attendants saw him, they_cried_out saying: Execute_on_a_stake. Execute_on_a_stake. The Pilatos is_saying to_them: You_all take him and execute_on_a_stake \add him\add*, because/for I am_ not _finding guilt in him.
\v 7 The Youdaiōns answered, to_him: We are_having \add a\add*_law, and according_to the law he_ought to_die_off, because he_made himself \add the\add*_son of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 8 Therefore when the Pilatos heard this the message, he_was_ more _afraid.
\v 9 And he_came_in into the residence_of_the_governor again, and is_saying to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd*: From_where are you? But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* not gave \add an\add*_answer to_him.
\v 10 Therefore the Pilatos is_saying to_him, you_are_ not _speaking To_me? You_have_ not _known that I_am_having authority to_send_ you _away, and I_am_having authority to_execute_on_a_stake you?
\v 11 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered to_him: You_were_ not _having authority against me not_one, except not/lest was having_been_given to_you from_above. Because_of this the \add one\add* having_given_ me _over to_you, is_having greater sin.
\v 12 Out_of this the Pilatos was_seeking to_send_away him. But the Youdaiōns cried_out saying: If you_may_send_away this \add man\add*, you_are not \add a\add*_friend of_ the _Kaisar. Everyone making himself which \add a\add*_king, is_speaking_against the against_Kaisar.
\v 13 Therefore the Pilatos, having_heard of_ the _messages these, brought outside the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, and he_sat_down on \add the\add*_tribunal, at \add a\add*_place being_called \add the\add*_Stone_Pavement, But in_Hebraios, Gabbatha.
\v 14 And it_was \add the\add*_preparation \add day\add* of_the passover_\add feast\add*, \add the\add*_hour was about \add the\add*_sixth. And he_is_saying to_the Youdaiōns: Behold, the king of_you_all. 
\v 15 And they cried_out: Take_away. Take_away. Execute_on_a_stake him. The Pilatos is_saying to_them: May_I_execute_on_a_stake the king of_you_all? The Chief_priests answered: We_are_ not _having \add a\add*_king, except not/lest Kaisar.
\v 16 Therefore then he_gave_ him _over, to_them, in_order_that he_may_be_executed_on_a_stake. They_took And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, led_ him _away
\v 17 And bearing the stake to_himself, he_came_out to the \add place\add* being_called: place Of_\add the\add*_skull, which is_being_called In_Hebraios, Golgotha/(Gulgolet),
\v 18 where they_executed_on_a_stake him, and with him two others, on_this_side and on_that_side, and the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* in_\add the\add*_middle.
\v 19 And the Pilatos wrote also \add a\add*_title, and put on the stake. And it_was having_been_written: \nd Yaʸsous\nd* the from_Nazaret, the king of_the Youdaiōns.
\v 20 Therefore this the title many of_the Youdaiōns read, because the place was near of_the city, where the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* was_executed_on_a_stake, and it_was having_been_written In_Hebraios, In_Latin, In_Hellaʸn.
\v 21 Therefore the chief_priests of_the Youdaiōns were_saying to_ the _Pilatos: Be_ not _writing: The king of_the Youdaiōns, but that that \add one\add* said: I_am king. of_the Youdaiōns.
\v 22 The Pilatos answered: What I_have_written, I_have_written.
\v 23 Therefore the soldiers when they_executed_on_a_stake the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, took the clothes of_him, and they_made four parts, \add a\add*_part to_each soldier, and the tunic. And the tunic was seamless, from the_ top _\add parts\add* woven through all.
\v 24 Therefore they_said to one_another: We_may_ not _tear it, but we_may_choose_by_lot for it, whose it_will_be, in_order_that the scripture may_be_fulfilled which saying: They_divided the clothes of_me to_themselves, and they_threw \add a\add*_lot for the clothing of_me. The therefore on_one_hand soldiers did these \add things\add*.
\v 25 On_the_other_hand the mother of_him had_stood by the stake of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd*, and the sister of_the mother of_him, Maria/(Miryām) the \add wife\add* of_ the _Clopas, and Maria the from_Magdala.
\v 26 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* therefore having_seen his mother, and the apprentice/follower having_stood_by whom he_was_loving, is_saying to_the mother: Woman, see, the son of_you.
\v 27 Thereafter he_is_saying to_the apprentice/follower: Behold, the mother of_you. And from that the hour took the apprentice/follower her to his own.
\v 28 After this having_known the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* that all \add things\add* now has_been_accomplished, in_order_that the scripture may_be_completed, he_is_saying: I_am_thirsting.
\v 29 \add A\add*_vessel was_lying full of_wine_vinegar, therefore \add a\add*_sponge full of_the wine_vinegar having_put_around around_\add a\add*_hyssop \add stalk\add*, they_brought over_it to_his mouth.
\v 30 Therefore when the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* took the wine_vinegar, he_said: It_has_been_finished. And having_bowed the head, he_gave_over his spirit.
\v 31 Therefore the Youdaiōns, because it_was \add the\add*_preparation \add day\add*, in_order_that the bodies may_ not _remain on the stake on the day_of_rest (for it_was great the day of_that the day_of_rest), they_asked the Pilatos that the legs of_them may_be_broken, and they_may_be_taken_away.
\v 32 Therefore the soldiers came, and they_broke the legs of_the first on_one_hand, and of_the other which having_been_executed_on_a_stake_with with_him, 
\v 33 on_the_other_hand having_come to the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, when they_saw him having_died already, they_ not _broke the legs of_him.
\v 34 But one of_the soldiers pierced the side of_him with_\add a\add*_spear, and immediately blood and water came_out.
\v 35 And the \add one\add* having_seen has_testified, and the testimony of_him is true, and that \add one\add* has_known that he_is_speaking true, in_order_that also you_all you_all_may_be_believing.
\v 36 For/Because these \add things\add* became, in_order_that the scripture may_be_fulfilled: Bone of_him ˓will˒_ not _be_being_broken.
\v 37 And again another scripture is_saying: They_will_be_looking on whom they_pierced.
\v 38 And after these \add things\add*, Yōsaʸf/(Yōşēf) which from Arimathaia being \add a\add*_apprentice/follower of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, but having_been_hidden because_of the fear of_the Youdaiōns asked the Pilatos, that he_may_take_away the body of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd*, and the Pilatos permitted \add it\add*.

\v 39 And Nikodaʸmos also came, the \add one\add* having_come to him at_the first by_night, bringing \add a\add*_wrapping of_myrrh and aloe, about \add a\add*_hundred pounds.
\v 40 Therefore they_took the body the of_\nd Yaʸsous\nd*, and they_bound it in_linen_cloths with the spices, as \add the\add*_custom of_the Youdaiōns is to_be_burying.
\v 41 And there_was \add a\add*_garden in the place where he_was_executed_on_a_stake, and in the garden \add a\add*_ new _tomb, in which not_yet no_one was having_been_laid.
\v 42 Therefore because_of the preparation \add day\add* of_the Youdaiōns, because near was the tomb, they_laid the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* there.

\v 1 And on_the first \add day\add* of_the week, Maria/(Miryām) the from_Magdala is_coming early, to the tomb still being darkness, and is_seeing the stone having_been_taken_away from the tomb.
\v 2 Therefore she_is_running and is_coming to Simōn Petros, and to the other apprentice/follower whom was_loving the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, and she_is_saying to_them: They_took_away the \nd master\nd* out_of the tomb, and we_have_ not _known where they_laid him.
\v 3 Therefore the Petros and the other apprentice/follower came_out, and they_were_coming to the tomb.
\v 4 And the two were_running together, and the other apprentice/follower ran_ahead more_quickly \add than\add* the Petros, and came to the tomb first.
\v 5 And having_stooped_down, he_is_seeing lying \add there\add* the linen_cloths, however he_ not _came_in.
\v 6 Therefore Simōn Petros is_ also _coming following after_him, and came_in into the tomb, and is_observing the linen_cloths lying \add there\add*,
\v 7 and the handkerchief, which was on the head of_him, lying \add there\add* not with the linen_cloths, but separately having_been_wrapped in one place.
\v 8 Therefore then the other apprentice/follower also came_in, which having_come first to the tomb, and he_saw and believed, 
\v 9 for/because they_had_ not_yet _known the scripture that it_is_fitting him to_rise_up from \add the\add*_dead.
\v 10 Therefore the apprentices/followers they_went_away again to themselves.
\v 11 But Maria/(Miryām) had_stood at the tomb outside weeping. Therefore as she_was_weeping, she_stooped_down into the tomb,
\v 12 and is_observing two messengers in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* was_lying.
\v 13 And those are_saying to_her: Woman, why are_you_weeping? She_is_saying to_them: Because they_took_away the \nd master\nd* of_me, and I_have_ not _known where they_laid him.
\v 14 Having_said these \add things\add*, she_was_turned back to the \add things\add*, and is_observing the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_stood, and had_ not _known that it_is \nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 15 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_her: Woman, why are_you_weeping? Whom are_you_seeking? That \add woman\add* supposing that he_is the gardener, is_saying to_him: Master, if you bore him, tell to_me where you_laid him, and_I will_be_taking_ him _away.
\v 16 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_her: Maria. that \add woman\add* Having_been_turned is_saying to_him In_Hebraios: Rabboni (that is_being_called: Teacher).
\v 17 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_her: Be_ not _touching against_me, because/for I_have_ not_yet _gone_up to the father, but be_going to the brothers of_me, and say to_them: I_am_going_up to the father of_me, and \add the\add*_father of_you_all, and \nd god\nd* of_me, and \nd god\nd* of_you_all.
\v 18 Maria/(Miryām) the from_Magdala Is_coming announcing to_the apprentices/followers, that I_have_seen the \nd master\nd*, and he_said these \add things\add* to_her.
\v 19 Therefore being evening the on_ that _day the first of_\add the\add*_week, and the doors having_been_shut where the apprentices/followers were because_of the fear of_the Youdaiōns, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* came and stood in the midst, and is_saying to_them: Peace to_you_all.
\v 20 And having_said this, he_showed his hands and his side to_them. Therefore the apprentices/followers were_elated, having_seen the \nd master\nd*.
\v 21 Therefore the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* he_said to_them again: Peace to_you_all, as the father has_sent_ me _out, also_I am_sending you_all.
\v 22 And having_said this, he_breathed_on \add them\add* and is_saying to_them: Receive holy \add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd*.
\v 23 If of_any you_all_may_forgive the sins, they_have_been_forgiven to_them, if of_any you_all_may_be_restraining, they_have_been_restrained.
\v 24 But Thōmas, one of the twelve, the \add one\add* being_called Didumos/[twin], was not with them when \nd Yaʸsous\nd* came.
\v 25 Therefore the other apprentices/followers were_saying to_him: We_have_seen the \nd master\nd*.

\v 26 And after eight days the apprentices/followers of_him were again inside, and Thōmas with them. the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* Is_coming, the doors having_been_shut, and stood in the midst, and said: Peace to_you_all.
\v 27 Thereafter he_is_saying to_ the _Thōmas: Be_bringing the finger of_you here, and see the hands of_me, and be_bringing the hand of_you, and put \add it\add* into the side of_me, and be_ not _becoming unbelieving, but believing.
\v 28 Thōmas answered and said to_him: - \nd master\nd* of_me and the \nd god\nd* of_me. 
\v 29 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him: Because you_have_seen me, have_believed, blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* not having_seen, and_yet having_believed.
\v 30 Many therefore on_one_hand other signs the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* also did before of_the apprentices/followers of_him, which is not having_been_written in the this scroll.
\v 31 On_the_other_hand these \add things\add* has_been_written, in_order_that you_all_may_be_believing that \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, the son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and in_order_that believing, you_all_may_be_having life in the name of_him.

\v 1 After these \add things\add*, \nd Yaʸsous\nd* revealed himself again to_the apprentices/followers at the sea of_ the _Tiberios, and he_revealed \add himself\add* thus:

\v 3 Simōn Petros is_saying to_them: I_am_going to_be_fishing. They_are_saying to_him: We are_ also _coming with you. They_came_out and they_boarded into the boat, and at that the night they_caught nothing.
\v 4 But in_the_morning already becoming, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* stood on the shore, however the apprentices/followers had_ not _known that it_is \nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 5 therefore \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: Little_children, you_all_are_ not _having any fish? They_answered to_him: No.
\v 6 And he said to_them: Cast the net to the right side of_the boat, and you_all_will_be_finding \add them\add*. Therefore they_throw, and was_ no_longer _able to_drag it because_of the multitude of_the fishes.
\v 7 Therefore the apprentice/follower that whom the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_loving is_saying to_ the _Petros: It_is the \nd master\nd*. Therefore Simōn Petros having_heard that it_is the \nd master\nd*, girded his outer_garment, because/for he_was naked, and throw himself into the sea.
\v 8 And the other apprentices/followers in_the little_boat came, because/for they_were not far from the land, but from about two_hundred cubits dragging the net with_the fishes.
\v 9 Therefore when they_got_out on the land, they_are_seeing \add a\add*_charcoal_fire lying, and fish laying_on \add it\add*, and bread.
\v 10 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: Bring from the fish which you_all_caught now.
\v 11 Therefore Simōn Petros went_up, and dragged the net to the land full of_ large _fishes \add a\add*_hundred fifty three, but being so_many, the net was_ not _torn.
\v 12 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_saying to_them: Come, eat_breakfast. But no_one of_the apprentices/followers was_daring to_question him, who are You? Having_known that it_is the \nd master\nd*.
\v 13 \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_coming, and is_taking the bread and is_giving to_them, and the fish likewise.
\v 14 This now \add the\add*_third \add time\add* \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_revealed to_the apprentices/followers, having_been_raised from \add the\add*_dead.

\v 16 He_is_saying to_him again secondly: Simōn \add son\add* of_Yōannaʸs, are_you_loving me? He_is_saying to_him: Yes, \nd master\nd*, you have_known that I_am_loving you. He_is_saying to_him: Be_shepherding the sheep of_me.
\v 17 He_is_saying to_him the third \add time\add*: Simōn \add son\add* of_Yōannaʸs, are_you_loving me? the Petros was_sorrowed because he_said to_him the third \add time\add*: Are_you_loving me?

\v 18 Truly, truly, I_am_saying to_you, when you_were younger, you_were_girding yourself, and you_were_walking where you_were_wanting, but whenever you_may_age, you_will_be_stretching_out the hands of_you, and another will_be_girding you, and will_be_bringing where you_are_ not _wanting.
\v 19 And he_said this, signifying by_what death he_will_be_glorifying the \nd god\nd*. And having_said this, he_is_saying to_him: Be_following after_me.
\v 20 Having_been_turned_back, the Petros is_seeing the apprentice/follower whom the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_loving who also sat_down at the supper on the chest of_him following, and said: \nd master\nd*, who is, the \add one\add* giving_ you _over?
\v 21 Therefore having_seen this \add one\add*, the Petros is_saying to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd*: \nd master\nd*, and what \add about\add* this \add one\add*?
\v 22 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him: If I_may_be_wanting him to_be_remaining until I_am_coming, what \add is_it\add* to you? You be_following after_me. 
\v 23 Therefore this the statement came_out among the brothers, that the that apprentice/follower is_dying_off. Not but the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* not said to_him that He_is_ not _dying_off, but \add only\add*: If I_may_be_wanting him to_be_remaining until I_am_coming, what \add is_it\add* to you?
\v 24 This \add one\add* is the apprentice/follower which testifying concerning these \add things\add*, and the \add one\add* having_written these \add things\add*, and we_have_known that the testimony of_him is true.
\v 25 And is also many other \add things\add* that the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* did, which if in_every one may_be_being_written, I_am_supposing not_even the world itself going_to_be_having_room for_the scrolls being_written.
