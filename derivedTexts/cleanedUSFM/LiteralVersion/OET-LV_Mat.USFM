\v 23 Behold, the virgin will_be_having in womb and will_be_bearing \add a\add*_son, and they_will_be_calling the name of_him Emmanouaʸl/(ˊImmānū\sup ʼēl\sup*), which is being_translated: - \nd god\nd* With us.

\v 25 and was_ not _knowing her until of_which she_bore \add a\add*_son, and he_called the name of_him, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\c 2
\v 1 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_been_born in Baʸthleʼem/(Bēyt-leḩem) of_ the _Youdaia in \add the\add*_days of_Haʸrōdaʸs the king, see, wise_men from east arrived in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim)
\v 2 saying: Where is the \add one\add*, having_been_born king of_the Youdaiōns? For/Because we_saw the star of_him in the east and we_came to_prostrate before_him.
\v 3 And the king Haʸrōdaʸs having_heard was_disturbed, and all Hierousalaʸm with him.
\v 4 And having_gathered_together all the chief_priests and scribes of_the people, he_was_inquiring from them where the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* is_being_born.
\v 5 And they said to_him: In Baʸthleʼem of_ the _Youdaia, because/for thus it_has_been_written through the prophet:
\v 6 And you Baʸthleʼem, land of_Youda/(Yəhūdāh), are by_no_means least among the rulers of_Youda, because/for out_of of_you will_be_coming_out \add a\add*_leading \add one\add*, who will_be_shepherding the people of_me, the Israaʸl/(Yisərā\sup ʼēl\sup*).
\v 7 Then Haʸrōdaʸs having_ secretly _called the wise_men, ascertained from them the time of_the appearing star.
\v 8 And having_sent them to Baʸthleʼem he_said: Having_been_gone, search_out exactly for the little_child, and when you_all_may_find \add him\add*, report to_me so_that also_I, having_come, may_prostrate before_him.
\v 9 And which having_heard from_the king, they_were_gone, and see, the star, which they_saw in the east, was_going_before them until having_come, it_was_stood over where the little_child was.
\v 10 And having_seen the star, they_were_ exceedingly _elated with_ great _joy.
\v 11 And having_come into the house, they_saw the little_child with Maria/(Mirəyām) the mother of_him, and having_fallen, they_prostrated before_him, and having_opened_up the treasures of_them, they_offered gifts to_him: gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
\v 12 And having_been_warned in \add a\add*_dream not to_return to Haʸrōdaʸs, they_withdrew by another way into the country of_them.
\v 13 And having_withdrawn from_them, see, \add an\add*_messenger of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* is_appearing in \add a\add*_dream to_ the _Yōsaʸf/(Yōşēf) saying: Having_been_raised, take the little_child and the mother of_him, and be_fleeing into Aiguptos/(Miʦərayim), and be there until wishfully I_may_tell to_you, because/for Haʸrōdaʸs is_going to_be_seeking the little_child which to_destroy him.
\v 14 And which having_been_raised, he_took the little_child and the mother of_him by_night and withdrew into Aiguptos,
\v 15 and he_was there until the death of_Haʸrōdaʸs, in_order_that the \add message\add* may_be_fulfilled having_been_spoken by \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* through the prophet saying: I_called the son of_me out_of of_Aiguptos.
\v 16 Then Haʸrōdaʸs, having_seen that he_was_mocked by the wise_men, was_enraged exceedingly and having_sent_out, he_killed all the boys which in Baʸthleʼem/(Bēyt-leḩem) and in all the regions of_it from two_year and lower, according_to the time which he_ascertained from the wise_men.
\v 17 Then the \add message\add* was_fulfilled having_been_spoken through Yeremias/(Yirəmə\sup yāh\sup*) the prophet saying,
\v 18 \add A\add*_voice in Ɽama/(Rāmāh) was_heard, weeping and great mourning, Ɽaⱪaʸl/(Rāḩēl) weeping for_the children of_her, and was_ not _wanting to_be_comforted, because they_are not.
\v 19 But the Haʸrōdaʸs having_died, see, \add an\add*_messenger of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* is_appearing in \add a\add*_dream to_ the _Yōsaʸf in Aiguptos
\v 20 saying: Having_been_raised, take the little_child and the mother of_him, and be_going into \add the\add*_land of_Israaʸl/(Yisərā\sup ʼēl\sup*), because/for the \add ones\add* seeking the life of_the little_child have_died.
\v 21 And he having_been_raised, took the little_child and the mother of_him, and came_in into \add the\add*_land of_Israaʸl/(Yisərā\sup ʼēl\sup*).
\v 22 But having_heard that Arⱪelaos is_reigning the over_Youdaia instead_of Haʸrōdaʸs the father of_him, he_was_afraid to_go_away there, and having_been_warned in \add a\add*_dream, he_withdrew into the districts of_ the _Galilaia/(Gālīl),
\v 23 and having_come, he_dwelt into \add a\add*_city being_called Nazaret, so_that the \add message\add* may_be_fulfilled having_been_spoken through the prophets, he_will_be_being_called that \add A\add*_from_Nazaret.
\c 3
\v 1 And in the those days Yōannaʸs the immerser is_arriving, proclaiming in the wilderness of_ the _Youdaia
\v 2 saying: Be_repenting, because/for the kingdom of_the heavens has_neared.
\v 3 For/Because this is the \add one\add* having_been_spoken through Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊə\sup yāh\sup*) the prophet saying: \add The\add*_voice of_\add a\add*_shouting \add one\add* in the wilderness prepare the way of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, be_making the paths of_him straight.
\v 4 And the Yōannaʸs himself was_having the clothing of_him from hairs of_\add a\add*_camel and \add a\add*_ leather _belt around the waist of_him, and the food of_him was locusts and wild honey.
\v 5 Then Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and all the Youdaia, and all the surrounding_region of_the Yordanaʸs/(Yarəddēn) was_going_out to him,
\v 6 and they_were_being_immersed by him in the Yordanaʸs River, confessing the sins of_them.
\v 7 But having_seen many of_the Farisaios_\add party\add* and Saddoukaios_\add sect\add* coming to the immersion of_him, he_said to_them: Brood of_vipers, who warned to_you_all to_flee from the coming severe_anger?
\v 8 Therefore produce fruit worthy of_ the _repentance.
\v 9 And you_all_may_ not _suppose to_be_saying among yourselves, we_are_having the Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱərāhām) father, because/for I_am_saying to_you_all that the \nd god\nd* is_able to_raise children to_ the _Abraʼam out_of the these stones.
\v 10 And already the axe is_lying to the root of_the trees, therefore every tree not producing good fruit is_being_cut_off and is_being_thrown into \add the\add*_fire.
\v 11 I on_one_hand am_immersing you_all in water to repentance, on_the_other_hand the \add one\add* coming after me is mightier \add than\add* me, of_whom not I_am worthy to_bear the sandals. He will_be_immersing you_all in \add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd* and with_fire.
\v 12 Of_whom the winnowing_fork \add is\add* in the hand of_him, and he_will_be_clearing_out the threshing_floor of_him, and will_be_gathering_together the wheat of_him into the barn, but the chaff he_will_be_burning_up with_ inextinguishable _fire.
\v 13 Then the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_arriving from the Galilaia/(Gālīl) to the Yordanaʸs/(Yarəddēn) to the Yōannaʸs, which to_be_immersed by him.
\v 14 But the was_forbidding him saying: I am_having need to_be_immersed by you, and you are_coming to me?
\v 15 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering said to him: Allow \add it\add* now, because/for thus it_is befitting to_us to_fulfill all righteousness. Then he_is_allowing him.
\v 16 And having_been_immersed, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* immediately went_up from the water, and see, the heavens were_opened_up, and he_saw the \nd spirit\nd* of_ the _\nd god\nd* coming_down as_if \add a\add*_dove and coming on him.
\v 17 And see, \add a\add*_voice out_of of_the heavens saying: This is the son of_me, the beloved in whom I_took_pleasure.
\c 4
\v 1 Then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_brought_up into the wilderness by the \nd spirit\nd* to_be_tempted by the devil.
\v 2 And having_fasted forty days and forty nights, later he_hungered.
\v 3 And the \add one\add* tempting having_approached, said to_him: If you_are \add the\add*_son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, speak that the these stones may_become loaves.
\v 4 But he answering said: It_has_been_written: The person not only by bread will_be_living, but by every message going_out through \add the\add*_mouth of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 5 Then the devil is_taking him to the holy city, and stood him on the pinnacle of_the temple,
\v 6 and he_is_saying to_him: If you_are \add the\add*_son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, throw yourself down, because/for it_has_been_written, that Will_be_commanding to_the messengers of_him concerning you, and: They_will_be_carrying you in \add their\add*_hands, lest you_may_strike the foot of_you against \add a\add*_stone.
\v 7 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* was_saying to_him: Again it_has_been_written: You will_ not _be_Testing \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* the \nd god\nd* of_you.
\v 8 Again the devil is_taking him to \add a\add*_ exceedingly high _mountain, and is_showing to_him all the kingdoms of_the world and the glory of_them,
\v 9 and he_said to_him: I_will_be_giving all these \add things\add* to_you if having_fallen, you_may_prostrate before_me.
\v 10 Then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him: Be_going_away Satan/(Sāţān), because/for it_has_been_written: You_will_be_prostrating \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* the \nd god\nd* of_you, and only unto_him you_will_be_serving.
\v 11 Then the devil is_leaving him, and see, messengers approached and were_serving unto_him.
\v 12 And having_heard that Yōannaʸs was_given_over, he_withdrew into the Galilaia/(Gālīl).
\v 13 And having_left the Nazaret, having_come he_dwelt at Kafarnaʼoum, which \add is\add* by_\add the\add*_seaside in \add the\add*_regions of_Zaboulōn/(Zəⱱūlūn) and Nefthaleim/(Nafəttālī), 
\v 14 in_order_that the \add message\add* may_be_fulfilled having_been_spoken by Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊə\sup yāh\sup*) the prophet saying,
\v 15 Land of_Zaboulōn and land of_Nefthaleim, way of_\add the\add*_sea, beyond the Yordanaʸs/(Yarəddēn), Galilaia of_the pagans.
\v 16 The people which sitting in darkness saw \add a\add*_ great _light, and to_the \add ones\add* sitting in \add a\add*_land and shadow of_death, \add a\add*_light rose on_them.
\v 17 From then the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* began to_be_proclaiming and to_be_saying: Be_repenting, because/for the kingdom of_the heavens has_neared.
\v 18 And walking beside the sea of_ the _Galilaia he_saw two, brothers, Simōn which being_called Petros and Andreas the brother of_him, throwing \add a\add*_throwing_net into the sea, because/for they_were fishermen.
\v 19 And he_is_saying to_them: Come after me, and I_will_be_making you_all fishermen of_people.
\v 20 And which immediately having_left the nets, they_followed after_him.
\v 21 And having_advanced from_there, he_saw two other brothers, Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ) the \add son\add* of_ the _Zebedaios and Yōannaʸs the brother of_him, in the boat with Zebedaios the father of_them, preparing the nets of_them, and he_called them.
\v 22 And which immediately having_left the boat and the father of_them, they_followed after_him.
\v 23 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* he_was_going_around in all the Galilaia/(Gālīl), teaching in the synagogues of_them, and proclaiming the good_message of_the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
\v 24 And the report of_him went_away into all the Suria/(ʼₐrām). And they_brought to_him all the \add ones\add* sickly, having with_various diseases, and being_gripped_with with_torments, being_demon_possessed, and being_epileptic, and paralytic, and he_healed them.
\v 25 And great crowds followed after_him from the Galilaia, and \add the\add*_Dekapolis, and Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and Youdaia, and beyond the Yordanaʸs/(Yarəddēn).
\c 5
\v 1 And having_seen the crowds, he_went_up on the mountain, and him having_sat_down, the apprentices/followers of_him approached to_him.
\v 2 And having_opened_up the mouth of_him, he_was_teaching them saying,
\v 3 Blessed \add are\add* the poor in_the spirit, because to_them is the kingdom of_the heavens.
\v 4 Blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* mourning, because they will_be_being_comforted.
\v 5 Blessed \add are\add* the gentle, because they will_be_inheriting the earth.
\v 6 Blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* hungering and thirsting the for_righteousness, because they will_be_being_satisfied.
\v 7 Blessed \add are\add* the merciful, because they will_be_being_shown_mercy.
\v 8 Blessed \add are\add* the pure the in_heart, because they will_be_seeing the \nd god\nd*.
\v 9 Blessed \add are\add* the peacemaking, because they will_be_being_called sons of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 10 Blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* having_been_persecuted on_account righteousness, because to_them is the kingdom of_the heavens.
\v 11 Blessed are_you_all whenever they_may_deride you_all and may_pursue and lying, they_may_say all evil against you_all on_account of_me.
\v 12 Be_rejoicing and be_exulting, because the reward of_you_all \add is\add* great in the heavens, because/for thus they_persecuted the prophets which before you_all.
\v 13 You_all are the salt of_the earth, but if the salt may_be_made_tasteless, with what it_will_be_being_salted? It_is_being_effective for nothing anymore, except not/lest having_been_throw out, to_be_being_trampled by the people.
\v 14 You_all are the light of_the world. \add A\add*_city lying on \add a\add*_mountain is_ not _able to_be_hidden.
\v 15 And_not they_are_lighting \add a\add*_lamp and are_putting it under the \add a\add*_basket, but on the lampstand, and it_is_shining for_all the \add ones\add* in the house.
\v 16 Thus let_ the light of_you_all _shine before the people, so_that they_may_see the good works of_you_all, and may_glorify the father of_you_all which in the heavens.
\v 17 You_all_may_ not _think that I_came to_tear_down the law or the prophets, I_came not to_tear_down, but to_fulfill.
\v 18 For/Because truly I_am_saying to_you_all, until the heaven and the earth wishfully may_pass_away, one Iota or one serif by_no_means may_ not _pass_away from the law, until wishfully all \add things\add* may_become.
\v 19 Therefore if whoever may_break the least one of_these of_the commands, and may_teach the people thus, will_be_being_called least in the kingdom of_the heavens, but whoever wishfully may_practice and may_teach, this \add one\add* will_be_being_called great in the kingdom of_the heavens.
\v 20 For/Because I_am_saying to_you_all that if the righteousness of_you_all not may_be_plentiful more of_the scribes and Farisaios_\add party\add*, by_no_means you_all_may_ not _come_in into the kingdom of_the heavens.
\v 21 You_all_heard that it_was_said to_the ancients: You will_ not _be_murdering, and whoever, wishfully may_murder, will_be liable to_the judgment.
\v 22 But I am_saying to_you_all that everyone which being_angered by_the brother of_him, will_be liable to_the judgment, and whoever wishfully may_say to_the brother of_him: Raca, will_be liable to_the council, and whoever wishfully may_say: Foolish, will_be liable to the geenna of_ the _fire.
\v 23 Therefore if you_may_be_offering the gift of_you at the altar, and_there you_may_be_reminded that the brother of_you is_having something against you,
\v 24 leave the gift of_you there before the altar. And be_going_away, first be_reconciled to_the brother of_you, and then having_come, be_offering the gift of_you.
\v 25 Be agreeing with_the opponent of_you quickly, as_long_as which you_are with him on the way, lest the opponent may_give_ you _over to_the judge, and the judge to_the attendant, and you_will_be_being_thrown into prison.
\v 26 Truly I_am_saying to_you, by_no_means you_may_ not _come_out from_there, until wishfully you_may_give_back the last quadran.
\v 27 You_all_heard that it_was_said: You will_ not _be_committing_adultery.
\v 28 But I am_saying to_you_all that everyone which looking at_\add a\add*_woman in_order that to_lust for_her, already committed_adultery with_her in the heart of_him.
\v 29 And if the the right eye of_you is_stumbling you, pluck_ it _out and throw \add it\add* from you, because/for it_is_benefitting for_you that one of_the members of_you may_perish, and not all the body of_you may_be_thrown into geenna.
\v 30 And if the right hand of_you is_stumbling you, cut_off it and throw \add it\add* from you, because/for it_is_benefitting for_you that one of_the members of_you may_perish, and not all the body of_you may_go_away into geenna.
\v 31 And it_was_said: Whoever wishfully may_send_away the wife of_him, let_him_give divorce to_her.
\v 32 But I am_saying to_you_all that everyone which sending_away the wife of_him, except on_account of_sexual_immorality, is_making her to_be_committing_adultery, and whoever may_marry if having_been_sent_ \add her\add* _away, is_causing_adultery.
\v 33 Again you_all_heard that it_was_said to_the ancients: You will_ not _be_perjuring, but you_will_be_giving_back to_the \nd master\nd* the oaths of_you.
\v 34 But I am_saying to_you_all not to_ actually _swear, neither by the heaven, because it_is \add the\add*_throne of_ the _\nd god\nd*, 
\v 35 nor by the earth, because it_is \add the\add*_footstool of_the feet of_him, nor in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), because it_is \add the\add*_city of_the great king, 
\v 36 nor may_you_swear by the head of_you, because you_are_ not _being_able to_make one hair white. or black.
\v 37 But let_be the statement of_you_all, yes \add be\add* yes, no \add be\add* no, and the additional \add than\add* these \add things\add* is from the evil.
\v 38 You_all_heard that it_was_said: Eye for \add an\add*_eye and tooth for \add a\add*_tooth.
\v 39 But I am_saying to_you_all, not to_resist against_the evil, but whoever is_slapping \add you\add* you on the right cheek, of_you turn to_him also the other, 
\v 40 and to_the \add one\add* willing you to_be_judged and to_take the tunic of_you, allow your coat to_him also, 
\v 41 and whoever will_be_compelling you one mile, be_going with him two.
\v 42 Give to_the \add one\add* requesting you, and you _may_ not _be_turned_away to_the \add one\add* wanting to_borrow from you.
\v 43 You_all_heard that it_was_said: You_will_be_loving the neighbor of_you, and you_will_be_hating the enemy of_you.
\v 44 But I am_saying to_you_all, be_loving the enemies of_you_all, and be_praying for the \add ones\add* persecuting you_all, 
\v 45 so_that you_all_may_become sons of_the father of_you_all who in \add the\add*_heavens, because he_is_rising the sun of_him on evil and good, and is_raining on \add the\add*_righteous and unrighteous.
\v 46 For/Because if you_all_may_love the \add ones\add* loving you_all, what reward are_you_all_having? Not also the tax_collectors are_doing the same?
\v 47 And if you_all_may_greet the brothers of_you_all only, what additional \add things\add* are_you_all_doing? Not also the pagans are_doing the same?
\v 48 Therefore you_all will_be perfect as the heavenly father of_you_all the is perfect.
\c 6
\v 1 Be_taking_heed not to_be_practicing the righteousness of_you_all before the people, in_order that to_be_seen by_them, and if not, surely you_all_are_having no reward with the father of_you_all, who \add is\add* in the heavens.
\v 2 Therefore whenever you_may_be_doing alms, you_may_ not _trumpet before you, as the hypocrites are_doing in the synagogues and in the streets, so_that they_may_be_glorified by the people. Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, they_are_receiving_fully the reward of_them.
\v 3 But of_you doing alms, not let_know the left \add hand\add* of_you what the right \add hand\add* of_you is_doing,
\v 4 so_that the alms of_you may_be in the secret, and the father of_you, the \add one\add* seeing in the secret, will_be_giving_back to_you.
\v 5 And whenever you_may_be_praying, you_all_will_ not _be like the hypocrites, because they_are_loving to_be_praying in the synagogues and having_stood on the corners of_the roads, so_that they_may_be_seen by_the people. Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, they_are_receiving_fully the reward of_them.
\v 6 But you whenever you_may_be_praying, come_in into the private_room of_you and having_shut the door of_you, pray to_the father of_you, who \add is\add* in the secret, and the father of_you, the \add one\add* seeing in the secret, will_be_giving_back to_you.
\v 7 And praying, you_all_may_ not _babble as the pagans for they_are_supposing that in the many_messages of_them they_will_be_being_listened_to.
\v 8 Therefore you_all _may_ not _be_likened to_them, because/for the \nd god\nd* the father of_you_all has_known what \add things\add* you_all_are_having need before the \add time\add* you_all to_request him.
\v 9 Therefore you_all be_praying thus: father of_us, the \add one\add* in the heavens, let_ the name of_you _be_sanctified.
\v 10 /Let/_ the kingdom of_you _come, let_be_ the will of_you _become, on earth also as in heaven.
\v 11 Give to_us today the the daily_needed bread of_us.
\v 12 And forgive to_us the debts of_us, as we also forgave to_the debtors of_us.
\v 13 And you_may_ not _carry_in us into temptation, but rescue us from the evil.
\v 14 For/Because if you_all_may_forgive to_ the _people the transgressions of_them, the the heavenly father of_you_all will_ also _be_forgiving to_you_all.
\v 15 But if you_all_may_ not _forgive to_ the _people the transgressions of_them, neither will_ the father of_you_all _be_forgiving the transgressions of_you_all.
\v 16 And whenever you_all_may_be_fasting, be_ not _becoming downthrow like the hypocrites, because/for they_are_disfiguring the appearances of_them, so_that they_may_be_seen by_the people fasting. Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, they_are_receiving_fully the reward of_them.
\v 17 But you fasting, anoint the head of_you and wash the face of_you,
\v 18 so_that you _may_ not _be_seen by_the people fasting, but to_the father of_you who \add is\add* in the secret, and the father of_you, the \add one\add* seeing in the secret, will_be_giving_back to_you.
\v 19 Be_ not _storing_up treasures on the earth for_you_all, where moth and corrosion is_destroying, and where thieves are_digging_through and are_stealing, 
\v 20 but be_storing_up for_you_all treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor corrosion is_destroying, and where thieves are_ not _digging_through nor are_stealing.
\v 21 For/Because where the treasure of_you is, the heart of_you will_be there also.
\v 22 The lamp of_the body is the eye. Therefore if the eye of_you may_be healthy, the whole body of_you will_be bright.
\v 23 But if the eye of_you may_be evil, all the body of_you will_be dark. Therefore if the light which in you \add is\add* darkness, how_great is the darkness. 
\v 24 No_one is_able to_be_serving for_two masters, because/for either he_will_be_hating the one and he_will_be_loving the other, or he_will_be_upholding of_\add the\add*_one and he_will_be_despising of_the other. You_all_are_ not _being_able to_be_serving for_\nd god\nd* and money.
\v 25 Because_of this I_am_saying to_you_all, be_ not _worrying for_the life of_you_all, what you_all_may_eat or what you_all_may_drink, nor for_the body of_you_all what you_all_may_dress_in. Not the life is more \add than\add* the food, and the body \add than\add* the clothing?
\v 26 Consider on the birds of_the sky, that they_are_ neither _sowing, nor are_they_reaping, nor are_they_gathering_together into barns, and the the heavenly father of_you_all is_feeding them, are_ not you_all _carrying_value more \add than\add* them?
\v 27 And who of you_all worrying is_able to_add one hour to the lifespan of_him?
\v 28 And about clothing why are_you_all_worrying? Observe how the lilies of_the field are_growing, they_are_ not _labouring nor are_they_spinning, 
\v 29 but I_am_saying to_you_all that not_even Solomōn/(Shəlmoh) in all the glory of_him clothed like one of_these.
\v 30 But if the \nd god\nd* is_ thus _dressing the grass of_the field being today, and tomorrow being_thrown into \add the\add*_furnace, not by_much more for_you_all, little_faith \add ones\add*?
\v 31 Therefore you_all_may_ not _worry saying: What may_we_eat, or: What may_we_drink, or: What may_we_clothed?
\v 32 For/Because the pagans are_seeking_after all these \add things\add*, because/for the the heavenly father of_you_all has_known that you_all_are_needing of_ all _these \add things\add*.
\v 33 But be_seeking first the kingdom and the righteousness of_him, and all these \add things\add* will_be_being_added to_you_all.
\v 34 Therefore you_all_may_ not _worry for the_ next _\add day\add*, because/for the_ next _\add day\add* will_be_worrying about_itself. The evil of_it sufficient to_the day \add is\add*.
\c 7
\v 1 Be_ not _judging, in_order_that you_all _may_ not _be_judged, 
\v 2 for/because with what judgment you_all_are_judging, you_all_will_be_being_judged, and with what measure you_all_are_measuring, it_will_be_being_measured to_you_all.
\v 3 And why you_are_looking the speck which in the eye of_the brother of_you, but you_are_ not _observing the \add speck\add* beam in the your eye?
\v 4 Or how you_will_be_saying to_the brother of_you: Allow \add that\add* I_may_throw_out the speck from the eye of_you, and see, the beam \add is\add* in the eye of_you?
\v 5 Hypocrite, first throw_out the beam from the eye of_you, and then you_will_be_seeing_clearly to_throw_out the speck from the eye of_the brother of_you.
\v 6 You_all_may_ not _give the holy \add thing\add* to_the dogs, nor may_you_all_throw the pearls of_you_all before the pigs, lest they_will_be_trampling them with the feet of_them, and having_been_turned they_may_attack you_all.
\v 7 Be_requesting and it_will_be_being_given to_you_all, be_seeking and you_all_will_be_finding, be_knocking and it_will_be_being_opened_up to_you_all.
\v 8 For/Because everyone which requesting is_receiving, and the \add one\add* seeking is_finding, and to_the \add one\add* knocking it_will_be_being_opened_up.
\v 9 Or which \add a\add*_person is of you_all, whom the son of_him will_be_requesting \add a\add*_loaf, not will_be_handing_out \add a\add*_stone to_him?
\v 10 Or also will_be_requesting \add a\add*_fish, not will_be_handing_out \add a\add*_serpent to_him?
\v 11 Therefore if you_all being evil, have_known to_be_giving good gifts to_the children of_you_all, to_how_much more the father of_you_all who \add is\add* in the heavens will_be_giving good \add things\add* to_the \add ones\add* requesting him?
\v 12 Therefore all \add things\add*, if as_many_as you_all_may_be_wanting that the people may_be_doing to_you_all, thus you_all also be_doing to_them. For/Because this is the law and the prophets.
\v 13 Come_in through the narrow gate, because the gate \add is\add* wide and the way \add is\add* broad which leading_away to the destruction, and many are the \add ones\add* coming_in through it, 
\v 14 how narrow \add is\add* the gate and the way which leading_away to the life having_been_narrowed \add is\add*, and few are the \add ones\add* finding it.
\v 15 Be_taking_heed of the false_prophets, who are_coming to you_all in clothing of_sheep, but inside they_are swindling wolves.
\v 16 You_all_will_be_knowing them by the fruits of_them. Surely_not they_are_gathering grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
\v 17 Thus every good tree is_producing good fruits, but the bad tree is_producing evil fruits.
\v 18 \add A\add*_ good _tree is_ not _able to_bear evil fruits, nor \add a\add*_ bad _tree to_be_producing good fruits.
\v 19 Every tree not producing good fruit is_being_cut_off and is_being_thrown into fire.
\v 20 Consequently surely you_all_will_be_knowing them by the fruits of_them.
\v 21 Not everyone which saying to_me: \nd master\nd*, \nd master\nd*, will_be_coming_in into the kingdom of_the heavens, but the \add one\add* doing the will of_the father of_me who \add is\add* in the heavens.
\v 22 Many will_be_saying to_me on that the day: \nd master\nd*, \nd master\nd*, not we_prophesied the in_your name, and we_throw_out demons the in_your name, and we_did many miracles the in_your name?
\v 23 And then I_will_be_confessing to_them, that I_ never _knew you_all: be_going_away from me, you_all working the lawlessness.
\v 24 Therefore everyone whoever is_hearing the these messages of_me and is_doing them, they_will_be_being_likened to_\add a\add*_ prudent _man, who built the house of_him on the rock.
\v 25 And the rain came_down, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they_fell_against to_ the that _house, and it_ not _fell, because/for it_had_been_established on the rock.
\v 26 And everyone which hearing the these messages of_me and not doing them, will_be_being_likened to_\add a\add*_ foolish _man, who built the house of_him on the sand.
\v 27 And the rain came_down, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they_struck the against_ that _house, and it_fell and the fall of_it was great.
\v 28 And it_became, when the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* finished the these messages, the crowds were_being_astonished at the teaching of_him, 
\v 29 for/because he_was teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes of_them.
\c 8
\v 1 And him having_come_down from the mountain, great crowds followed after_him.
\v 2 And see, \add a\add*_leper having_approached, was_prostrating to_him saying: \nd master\nd*, if you_may_be_willing, you_are_being_able to_cleanse me.
\v 3 And having_stretched_out his hand, he_touched against_him saying: I_am_willing, be_cleansed. And immediately the of_leprosy of_him was_cleansed.
\v 4 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him: Be_seeing you_may_tell to_no_one, but be_going yourself, show to_the priest, and offer the gift which Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) commanded, because/for \add a\add*_testimony to_them.
\v 5 And of_him having_come_in into Kafarnaʼoum, \add a\add*_centurion approached to_him imploring him
\v 6 and saying, \nd master\nd*, the paralytic servant of_me has_been_laid in the house, being_tormented terribly.
\v 7 And he_is_saying to_him: I having_come, will_be_healing him.
\v 8 And the centurion answering was_saying: \nd master\nd*, I_am not worthy that you_may_come_in under the roof of_me, but only speak by_\add the\add*_message and the servant of_me will_be_being_healed.
\v 9 For/Because I also am \add a\add*_man being_appointed under authority, having soldiers under myself, and I_am_saying to_this \add one\add*: Be_gone, and he_is_going, and to_another: Be_coming, and he_is_coming, and to_the slave of_me: Do this, and he_is_doing \add it\add*.
\v 10 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_heard, marvelled and said to_the \add ones\add* following: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, I_found so_much faith from no_one in the Israaʸl/(Yisərā\sup ʼēl\sup*).
\v 11 And I_am_saying to_you_all that many from east and west will_be_coming and will_be_being_reclined with Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱərāhām), and Isaʼak/(Yiʦəḩāq), and Yakōb/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), in the kingdom of_the heavens, 
\v 12 but the sons of_the kingdom will_be_being_thrown_out into the the outer darkness, there will_be the weeping and the grating of_ the _teeth.
\v 13 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_the centurion: Be_going, let_it_be_become with_you as you_believed. And the servant was_healed in that the hour.
\v 14 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_come to the house of_Petros, he_saw the mother_in_law of_him having_been_laid and being_feverish,
\v 15 and he_touched against_the hand of_her, and the fever left her, and she_was_raised, and was_serving unto_him.
\v 16 And having_become evening, they_brought many to_him being_demon_possessed, and he_throw_out the spirits by_\add a\add*_message, and he_healed all the \add ones\add* being sickly, 
\v 17 so_that the \add message\add* may_be_fulfilled having_been_spoken by Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊə\sup yāh\sup*) the prophet saying: Himself took the sicknesses of_us and bore the diseases.
\v 18 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_seen crowd around him, he_commanded \add them\add* to_go_away to the \add side\add* across.
\v 19 And one scribe having_approached, said to_him: Teacher, I_will_be_following after_you wherever if you_may_be_going_away.
\v 20 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_saying to_him: - Foxes are_having burrows and the birds of_the sky nests, but the \add the\add*_son of_ the _man is_having not where he_may_be_laying his head.
\v 21 And another of_the apprentices/followers said to_him: \nd master\nd*, permit to_me first to_go_away and to_bury the father of_me.
\v 22 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him: Be_following after_me and leave the dead to_bury the dead by_themselves.
\v 23 And the apprentices/followers of_him having_boarded with_him into \add the\add*_boat, followed after_him.
\v 24 And see, \add a\add*_ great _storm became in the sea, so_that the boat to_be_being_covered by the waves, but he was_sleeping.
\v 25 And having_approached, they_raised him saying: \nd master\nd*, save \add us\add*, we_are_perishing. 
\v 26 And he_is_saying to_them: Why are_you_all fearful, little_faith \add ones\add*? Then having_been_raised, he_gave_rebuke to_the winds and the sea, and \add a\add*_ great _calm became.
\v 27 And the people marvelled saying: What_kind_of \add man\add* is this that both the winds and the sea are_submitting to_him?
\v 28 And him having_come to the \add side\add* across to the region of_the Gadaraʸnos, two being_demon_possessed met with_him coming_out out_of the tombs, exceedingly dangerous so_that not anyone to_be_was_able to_pass_by by the that way.
\v 29 And see, they_cried_out saying: What to_us and to_you, son of_ the _\nd god\nd*? You_came here to_torment us before \add the\add*_time?
\v 30 And \add a\add*_herd of_ many _pigs was being_fed far from them.
\v 31 And the demons were_imploring him saying: If you_are_throwing_ us _out, send_ us _out into the herd of_ the _pigs.
\v 32 And he_said to_them: Be_going. And which having_come_out they_went_away into the pigs, and see, all the herd rushed down the steep_bank into the sea, and they_died_off in the waters.
\v 33 And the \add ones\add* feeding \add them\add* fled, and having_gone_away into the city, they_reported all \add things\add* and the \add things\add* of_the \add ones\add* being_demon_possessed.
\v 34 And see, all the city came_out to \add a\add*_meeting the with_\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, and having_seen him, they_implored \add him\add* so_that he_may_depart from the regions of_them.
\c 9
\v 1 And having_boarded into \add a\add*_boat, he_crossed_over and came to his own city.
\v 2 And see, they_were_bringing \add a\add*_paralytic to_him having_been_laid on \add a\add*_bed. And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_seen the faith of_them, he_said to_the paralytic: Be_having_courage, child, the sins of_you are_being_forgiven.
\v 3 And see, some of_the scribes said among themselves: This \add man\add* is_slandering. 
\v 4 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_seen the thoughts of_them said: For/Because_ why _reason are_you_all_considering evil in the hearts of_you_all?
\v 5 For/Because which is easier to_say: The sins of_you are_being_forgiven, or to_say: Be_raising and be_walking?
\v 6 But in_order_that you_all_may_have_known that the son of_ the _man is_having authority on the earth to_be_forgiving sins (then he_is_saying to_the paralytic): Having_been_raised, take_up the bed of_you and be_going to the house of_you.
\v 7 And having_been_raised, he_went_away to the house of_him.
\v 8 But having_seen \add this\add*, the crowds were_afraid and they_glorified the \nd god\nd*, who having_given such authority to_ the _humans.
\v 9 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* passing_by from_there, he_saw \add a\add*_man being_called Matthaios sitting at the tax_office, and he_is_saying to_him. Be_following after_me. And having_risen_up, he_followed after_him.
\v 10 And it_became of_him reclining in the house, and see, many tax_collectors and sinners having_come were_reclining the with_\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* and the apprentices/followers of_him.
\v 11 And having_seen \add it\add*, the Farisaios_\add party\add* were_saying to_the apprentices/followers of_him: For/Because_ why _reason is_ the teacher of_you_all _eating with the tax_collectors and sinners?
\v 12 And he having_heard said: The \add ones\add* being_strong are_ not _having need of_\add a\add*_doctor, but the \add ones\add* being sickly.
\v 13 But having_been_gone, learn what is \add this\add*: I_am_wanting Mercy and not sacrifice, because/for I_came not to_call \add the\add*_righteous \add ones\add*, but sinners.
\v 14 Then the apprentices/followers of_Yōannaʸs are_approaching to_him saying: For/Because_ why _reason we and the Farisaios_\add party\add* are_fasting, but the apprentices/followers of_you are_ not _fasting?
\v 15 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_them: The sons of_the bridal_chamber are_ not _being_able to_be_mourning, because/for as_long_as the bridegroom is with them? But days will_be_coming whenever the bridegroom may_be_taken_away from them, and then they_will_be_fasting.
\v 16 But no_one is_putting_on \add a\add*_patch of_ unshrunken _cloth on \add a\add*_ old _garment, because/for the patch of_it is_tearing_away from the garment, and \add a\add*_worse tear is_becoming.
\v 17 Nor are_they_putting new wine into old wineskins, and if not surely, the wineskins are_being_burst, and the wine is_being_poured_out and the wineskins are_being_destroyed. But they_are_putting new wine into new wineskins, and both are_being_preserved.
\v 18 Of_him speaking these \add things\add* to_them, see, one ruler having_approached, he_was_prostrating to_him saying, that The daughter of_me now died, but having_come, lay_on the hand of_you on her and she_will_be_living.
\v 19 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_been_raised, followed after_him and the apprentices/followers of_him.
\v 20 And see, \add a\add*_woman hemorrhaging twelve years having_approached behind, she_touched against_the fringe of_the garment of_him.
\v 21 For/Because she_was_saying in herself: If only I_may_touch against_the garment of_him, I_will_be_being_healed.
\v 22 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_been_turned and having_seen her said: Be_having_courage, daughter, the faith of_you has_healed you. And the woman was_healed from the that hour.
\v 23 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_come into the house of_the ruler, and having_seen the flute_players and the crowd being_distressed
\v 24 he_was_saying: Be_withdrawing, because/for the little_girl not died_off, but she_is_sleeping. And they_were_ridiculing of_him.
\v 25 But when the crowd was_thrown_out, having_come_in he_took_hold of_the hand of_her, and the little_girl was_raised.
\v 26 And the this news came_out into all the that land.
\v 27 And passing_by from_there the with_\nd Yaʸsous\nd*, two blind \add men\add* followed after_him crying_out and saying: Show_mercy to_us, son of_Dawid/(Dāvid).
\v 28 And having_come into the house, the blind \add men\add* approached to_him, and the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: Are_you_all_believing that I_am_being_able to_do this? They_are_saying to_him: Yes, \nd master\nd*.
\v 29 Then he_touched against_the eyes of_them saying: Let_it_be_become to_you_all according_to the faith of_you_all.
\v 30 And the eyes of_them were_opened_up. And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* was_admonished to_them saying: Be_seeing \add that\add* let_ no_one _be_knowing.
\v 31 But the \add ones\add* having_come_out, they_spread_ him _abroad in all the that land.
\v 32 And them coming_out, see, they_brought to_him mute being_demon_possessed.
\v 33 And the demon having_been_throw_out, the mute \add man\add* spoke. And the crowds marvelled saying: It_was_ never _seen thus in the Israaʸl/(Yisərā\sup ʼēl\sup*).
\v 34 But the Farisaios_\add party\add* were_saying: He_is_throwing_out the demons by the ruler of_the demons.
\v 35 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_going_around all the cities and the villages, teaching in the synagogues of_them, and proclaiming the good_message of_the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness.
\v 36 And having_seen the crowds, he_was_feeling_compassion for them, because they_were having_been_troubled and having_been_helpless, as_if sheep not having \add a\add*_shepherd.
\v 37 Then he_is_saying to_the apprentices/followers of_him: On_one_hand the harvest \add is\add* great, on_the_other_hand the workers \add are\add* few, 
\v 38 therefore be_besought of_the \nd master\nd* of_the harvest, so_that he_may_send_forth workers into the harvest of_him.
\c 10
\v 1 And having_called_to the twelve apprentices/followers of_him, he_gave authority to_them over_ unclean _spirits, so_as to_be_throwing_ them _out and to_be_healing every disease and every sickness.
\v 2 And the of_\add the\add*_twelve ambassadors the names is these: first Simōn which being_called Petros, and Andreas the brother of_him, and Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ) the \add son\add* of_ the _Zebedaios, and Yōannaʸs the brother of_him,

\v 5 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* sent_out these the twelve having_commanded to_them saying: You_all_may_ not _go_away into \add the\add*_way of_\add the\add*_pagans, and you_all_may_ not _come_in into city of_\add the\add*_Samareitaʸs/(Shomərōn),

\v 8 Be_healing ailing \add ones\add*, be_raising \add the\add*_dead, be_cleansing \add the\add*_lepers, be_throwing_out demons, you_all_received undeservedly, give undeservedly.
\v 9 You_all_may_ neither _acquire gold, nor silver, nor copper in the belts of_you_all,
\v 10 nor knapsack for \add the\add*_way, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor staff, because/for the worker \add is\add* worthy of_the food of_him.
\v 11 And into whatever wishfully city or village you_all_may_come_in, search_out who in it is worthy, and_ remain _there until wishfully you_all_may_come_out.
\v 12 And coming_in into the house, greet it.
\v 13 And if on_one_hand the house may_be worthy, let_ the peace of_you_all _come on it, on_the_other_hand if may_be not worthy, let_ the peace of_you_all _be_returned to you_all.
\v 14 And whoever wishfully may_ not _receive you_all, nor may_hear the messages of_you_all, coming_out out of_the house or the that city, shake_off the dust of_the feet of_you_all.
\v 15 Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, it_will_be more_tolerable for_\add the\add*_land of_Sodoma/(Şədom) and of_Gomorra/(ˊₐmorāh) on \add the\add*_day of_judgment, than the for_ that _city.
\v 16 Behold, I am_sending_ you_all _out as sheep in \add the\add*_midst of_wolves, therefore be_becoming shrewd as the serpents and innocent as the doves.
\v 17 But be_taking_heed of the people, because/for they_will_be_giving_ you_all _over into councils, and they_will_be_flogging you_all in the synagogues of_them, 
\v 18 and you_all_will_be_being_brought before governors and also kings on_account me, because/for \add a\add*_testimony to_them and to_the pagans.
\v 19 But whenever they_may_give_ you_all _over, you_all_may_ not _worry how or what you_all_may_speak, because/for what you_all_may_speak will_be_being_given to_you_all in that the hour.
\v 20 For/Because you_all are not the \add ones\add* speaking, but the \nd spirit\nd* of_the father of_you_all which speaking in you_all.
\v 21 And brother will_be_giving_over brother to death, and father child, and children will_be_rising_up against parents, and they_will_be_putting_ them _to_death.
\v 22 And you_all_will_be being_hated by all because_of the name of_me, but the \add one\add* having_endured to \add the\add*_end, this \add one\add* will_be_being_saved.
\v 23 But whenever they_may_be_persecuting you_all in the this city, be_fleeing to the next, because/for, truly I_am_saying to_you_all, by_no_means you_all_may_ not _finish the cities of_the Israaʸl/(Yisərā\sup ʼēl\sup*), until the son of_ the _man may_come.
\v 24 \add A\add*_apprentice/follower is not above the teacher, nor \add a\add*_slave above the master of_him.
\v 25 \add it_is\add* Sufficient for_the apprentice/follower that he_may_become as the teacher of_him, and the slave as the master of_him. If they_called the home_owner Beʼelzeboul, to_how_much more the household of_him?
\v 26 Therefore be_ not _afraid of_them, because/for nothing is having_been_covered which will_ not _be_being_revealed, and hidden which will_ not _be_being_known.
\v 27 What I_am_telling to_you_all in the darkness, speak in the light, and what you_all_are_hearing in the ear, proclaim on the housetops.
\v 28 And be_ not _afraid of the \add ones\add* killing_off the body, but not being_able to_kill_off the soul, but rather be_fearing the \add one\add* being_able to_destroy both soul and body in geenna.
\v 29 Not two sparrows is_being_sold for_\add an\add*_assarion_\add coin\add*? And not one of them will_be_falling to the ground, apart_from the father of_you_all.
\v 30 But the hairs of_the head of_you_all also are having_ all _been_numbered.
\v 31 Therefore be_ not _fearing, you_all are_carrying_value \add than\add* many sparrows.
\v 32 Therefore everyone who will_be_confessing in me before the people, also_I will_be_confessing in him before the father of_me who \add is\add* in \add the\add*_heavens.
\v 33 But whoever may_disown me before the people, also_I will_be_disowning him before the father of_me who \add is\add* in \add the\add*_heavens.
\v 34 You_all_may_ not _think that I_came to_bring peace to the earth, I_came not to_bring peace, but \add a\add*_sword.
\v 35 For/Because I_came to_divide \add a\add*_man against the father of_him, and \add a\add*_daughter against the mother of_her, and \add a\add*_daughter-in-law against the mother_in_law of_her
\v 36 and enemies of_the person the household of_him.
\v 37 The \add one\add* loving father or mother above me, is not worthy of_me, and the \add one\add* loving son or daughter above me, is not worthy of_me.
\v 38 And who is_ not _taking the stake of_him and is_following after me, is not worthy of_me.
\v 39 The \add one\add* having_found the life of_him will_be_losing it, and the \add one\add* having_lost the life of_him on_account me will_be_finding it.
\v 40 The \add one\add* receiving you_all is_receiving me, and the \add one\add* receiving me is_receiving the \add one\add* having_sent_ me _out.

\c 11
\v 1 And it_became when the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* finished directing to_the twelve apprentices/followers of_him, he_departed from_there which to_be_teaching and to_be_proclaiming in the cities of_them.
\v 2 And the Yōannaʸs, having_heard in the prison the works of_the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, having_sent through of_the apprentices/followers of_him,
\v 3 said to_him: Are you the \add one\add* coming, or are_we_waiting for_another?
\v 4 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering said to_them: Having_been_gone report to_Yōannaʸs what you_all_are_hearing and you_all_are_seeing:
\v 5 blind are_receiving_sight, and lame are_walking, lepers are_being_cleansed, and deaf are_hearing, and dead are_being_raised, and poor are_being_good_message_preached.
\v 6 And he_is blessed who if may_ not _be_offended in me.
\v 7 And these going, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* began to_be_saying to_the crowds concerning Yōannaʸs, you_all_came_out into the wilderness to_see What? \add A\add*_reed being_shaken by wind?
\v 8 But you_all_came_out to_see what? \add A\add*_man having_been_dressed in fine \add clothes\add*? Behold, the \add ones\add* wearing the fine \add clothes\add* in the houses of_the kings
\v 9 but why you_all_came_out? To_see \add a\add*_prophet? Yes, I_am_saying to_you_all, and more_important \add than\add* \add a\add*_prophet.
\v 10 This \add one\add* is concerning whom it_has_been_written: Behold, I am_sending_out the messenger of_me before \add the\add*_face of_you, who will_be_preparing the way of_you before you.
\v 11 Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, not has_been_raised among \add the\add*_born \add ones\add* of_women greater \add than\add* greater \add than\add* Yōannaʸs the immerser. But the \add the\add*_least in the kingdom of_the heavens, is greater \add than\add* he.
\v 12 And from the days of_Yōannaʸs the immerser until now, the kingdom of_the heavens is_forcing, and forceful_men they_are_snatching it.
\v 13 For/Because all the prophets and the law prophesied until Yōannaʸs.
\v 14 And if you_all_are_willing to_receive \add it\add*, he is Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*), the \add one\add* going to_be_coming.
\v 15 The \add one\add* having ears to_be_hearing, let_him_be_hearing.
\v 16 But to_what I_will_be_likening the this generation? It_is similar to_little_children sitting in the marketplaces, who calling_out to_the others
\v 17 are_saying: We_played_the_flute for_you_all and you_all_ not _danced, we_lamented and you_all_ not _mourn.
\v 18 For/Because Yōannaʸs came neither eating nor drinking, and they_are_saying: He_is_having \add a\add*_demon.
\v 19 The son of_ the _man came eating and drinking, and they_are_saying: Behold, \add a\add*_man, \add a\add*_glutton and \add a\add*_drunkard, \add a\add*_friend of_tax_collectors and of_sinners. But the wisdom was_justified by the her children.
\v 20 Then he_began to_be_deriding the cities in which the most miracles of_him became, because they_ not _repented.
\v 21 Woe to_you, Ⱪorazin. Woe to_you, Baʸthsaida. Because if the miracles which having_become in you_all became in Turos/(Tsor) and Sidōn/(Tsīdōn), long_ago they_ would _repented in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 22 However I_am_saying to_you_all, it_will_be more_tolerable for_Turos and Sidōn in day of_judgment than for_you_all.
\v 23 Also you, Kafarnaʼoum, will_ not _be_being_exalted to heaven? You_will_be_coming_down to Hadaʸs. Because if the miracles which having_become in you were_become in Sodoma/(Şədom), would remained until the \add day\add* today.
\v 24 However I_am_saying to_you_all that it_will_be more_tolerable for_\add the\add*_land of_Sodoma in day of_judgment than for_you.
\v 25 At that the time the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answering said: I_am_confessing to_you, father, \nd master\nd* of_the heaven and the earth, that you_hid these \add things\add* from wise and intelligent, and you_revealed them to_infants.
\v 26 Yes, the father, because thus it_became good_pleasure before you.
\v 27 All \add things\add* was_given_over to_me by the father of_me, and no_one is_knowing_fully the son, except not/lest the father, nor anyone is_knowing_fully the father, except not/lest the son, and to_whom if the son may_be_wishing to_reveal \add him\add*.
\v 28 Come to me, all you_all wearied and having_been_burdened, and_I will_be_resting you_all.
\v 29 Take_up the yoke of_me on you_all, and learn from me, because I_am gentle and humble the in_heart: and you_all_will_be_finding rest for_the souls of_you_all.
\v 30 For/Because the yoke of_me \add is\add* easy and the burden of_me is light.
\c 12
\v 1 At that the time, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_gone on_the days_of_rest through the grainfields, and the \add the\add*_apprentices/followers of_him hungered, and began to_be_plucking heads_of_grain and to_be_eating.
\v 2 And the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_seen, said to_him: Behold, the apprentices/followers of_you are_doing what it_is_ not _permitting to_be_doing on \add the\add*_day_of_rest.
\v 3 But he said to_them: Not you_all_read what Dawid/(Dāvid) did, when he_hungered and the \add ones\add* with him?
\v 4 How he_came_in into the house of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and they_ate the bread of_the presence, which it_was not permitting for_him to_eat, nor for_the \add ones\add* with him, except only not/lest for_the priests?
\v 5 Or you_all_ not _read in the law that on_the days_of_rest the priests in the temple are_profaning the day_of_rest, and they_are innocent?
\v 6 But I_am_saying to_you_all that \add one\add* greater \add than\add* the temple is here.
\v 7 But if you_all_had_known what \add this\add* is: I_am_wanting Mercy and not sacrifice, you_all_ would not _convicted the innocent.
\v 8 For/Because the son of_ the _man is \nd master\nd* of_the day_of_rest.
\v 9 And having_departed from_there, he_came into the synagogue of_them.
\v 10 And see, \add a\add*_man having \add a\add*_ withered _hand. And they_asked him saying: - Is_it_permitting to_be_healing on_the days_of_rest? In_order_that they_may_accuse against_him.
\v 11 And he said to_them: What person will_be of you_all, who will_be_having one sheep, and if this may_fall_in into \add a\add*_pit on_the days_of_rest, will_ not _be_taking_hold_of it and will_be_raising \add it\add*?
\v 12 For/Because_how_much therefore \add a\add*_human is_carrying_value \add than\add* \add a\add*_sheep? So_then it_is_permitting to_be_doing good on_the days_of_rest.
\v 13 Then he_is_saying to_the man: Stretch_out the hand of_you. And he_stretched_out \add it\add*, and it_was_restored, healthy as the other.
\v 14 But the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_come_out, received \add a\add*_counsel against him, so_that they_may_destroy him.
\v 15 But the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_known, withdrew from_there. And great followed after_him, and he_healed them all,
\v 16 and he_warned to_them that they_may_ not _make him manifest.
\v 17 In_order_that the \add message\add* may_be_fulfilled having_been_spoken by Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊə\sup yāh\sup*) the prophet saying,
\v 18 Behold, the servant of_me whom I_chose, the beloved of_me whom the soul of_me took_pleasure I_will_be_putting the \nd spirit\nd* of_me on him, and he_will_be_reporting justice to_the pagans.
\v 19 He will_ not _be_quarrelling, nor will_be_crying_out, nor will_ anyone _be_hearing the voice of_him in the roads.
\v 20 By_no_means he_will_be_breaking \add a\add*_reed having_been_bruised, and by_no_means he_will_be_extinguishing \add a\add*_wick being_smoldering, until wishfully he_may_send_forth the justice to victory.
\v 21 And \add the\add*_pagans will_be_hoping in_the name of_him.
\v 22 Then \add a\add*_being_demon_possessed \add man\add* was_brought to_him, blind and mute, and he_healed him, so_that the mute \add man\add* to_be_speaking and to_be_seeing.
\v 23 And all the crowds were_marvelling and were_saying: Surely_not this \add one\add* is the son of_Dawid/(Dāvid)?
\v 24 And the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_heard said: This \add man\add* is_ not _throwing_out the demons, except not/lest by the Beʼelzeboul, ruler of_the demons.
\v 25 And having_known the thoughts of_them, he_said to_them: Every kingdom having_been_divided against itself is_being_desolated, and every city or house having_been_divided against itself will_ not _be_being_stood.
\v 26 And if the Satan/(Sāţān) is_throwing_out the Satan, he_was_divided against himself. Therefore how will_ the kingdom of_him _be_being_established?
\v 27 And if I am_throwing_out the demons by Beʼelzeboul, by whom the sons of_you_all are_they_throwing_out? Because_of this, they will_be judges of_you_all.
\v 28 But if I am_throwing_out the demons by \add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd* of_\nd god\nd*, consequently the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* came on you_all.
\v 29 Or how is_ anyone _able to_come_in into the house of_the strong \add man\add* and to_snatch the goods of_him, if not first he_may_bind the strong \add man\add*? And then he_will_be_thoroughly_plundering the household of_him.
\v 30 The \add one\add* not being with me is against me, and the \add one\add* not gathering_together with me is_scattering.
\v 31 Because_of this I_am_saying to_you_all, every sin and slander will_be_being_forgiven to_the people, but the slander of_the \nd spirit\nd* will_ not _be_being_forgiven.
\v 32 And if whoever may_speak \add a\add*_message against the son of_ the _Man, it_will_be_being_forgiven to_him, but whoever wishfully may_speak against the the holy \nd spirit\nd*, it will_ not _be_being_forgiven to_him, neither in this the age nor in the \add one\add* coming.
\v 33 Either make the tree good and the fruit of_it good, or make the tree bad and the fruit of_it bad, because/for the tree is_being_known by the fruit.
\v 34 Brood of_vipers, being evil how are_you_all_being_able to_be_speaking good \add things\add*? For/Because the mouth is_speaking out_of the excess of_the heart.
\v 35 The good person is_sending_forth good out_of his good treasure, and the evil person is_sending_forth evil out_of his evil treasure.
\v 36 But I_am_saying to_you_all that every idle message that the people will_be_speaking, they_will_be_giving_back \add an\add*_account for it in day of_judgment.
\v 37 For/Because you_will_be_being_justified by the messages of_you, and you_will_be_being_convicted by the messages of_you.
\v 38 Then some of_the scribes and Farisaios_\add party\add* answered to_him saying: Teacher, we_are_wanting to_see \add a\add*_sign from you.
\v 39 But he answering said to_them, \add A\add*_ evil and adulterous _Generation is_seeking_after \add a\add*_sign, and \add a\add*_sign will_ not _be_being_given to_it, except not/lest the sign of_Yōnas/(Yōnāh) the prophet.
\v 40 For/Because as Yōnas was in the belly of_the huge_fish three days and three nights, thus the son of_ the _man will_be three days and three nights in the heart of_the earth.
\v 41 \add The\add*_ Nineuitaʸs/(\add ones\add*_from_Nīnəvēh) _men will_be_standing_up in the judgment with the this generation, and they_will_be_condemning it, because they_repented at the proclamation of_Yōnas, and see, \add one\add*_greater \add than\add* Yōnas \add is\add* here.
\v 42 \add The\add*_queen of_\add the\add*_south will_be_being_raised in the judgment with the this generation, and will_be_condemning it, because she_came from the ends of_the earth to_hear the wisdom of_Solomōn/(Shəlmoh), and see, \add one\add*_greater \add than\add* Solomōn \add is\add* here.
\v 43 And whenever the unclean spirit may_come_out from the person, it_is_passing_through through waterless places seeking rest and it_is_ not _finding.
\v 44 Then it_is_saying: I_will_be_turning_back to the house of_me whence I_came_out. And having_come, it_is_finding being_unoccupied having_been_swept and having_been_adorned.
\v 45 Then it_is_going and is_taking with itself seven other spirits more_evil \add than\add* itself, and having_come_in it_is_dwelling there, and the last \add state\add* of_the that person is_becoming worse \add than\add* the first. Thus it_will_be also to_ the this - evil _generation.
\v 46 Him still speaking to_the crowds, see, the mother and the brothers of_him had_stood outside, seeking to_speak to_him.
\v 47 And someone said to_him: Behold, the mother of_you and the brothers of_you have_stood outside seeking to_speak to_you.
\v 48 But he answering said to_the \add one\add* speaking to_him: Who is the mother of_me and who_all are the brothers of_me?
\v 49 And having_stretched_out the hand of_him to the apprentices/followers of_him he_said: Behold, the mother of_me and the brothers of_me.
\v 50 For/Because whoever wishfully may_do the will of_the father of_me who \add is\add* in \add the\add*_heavens, he is brother, and sister, and mother of_me.
\c 13
\v 1 In the that day, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_come_out from_the house, was_sitting by the sea.
\v 2 And great crowds were_gathered_together to him, so_that him having_boarded into \add a\add*_boat to_be_sitting, and all the crowd had_stood on the shore.
\v 3 And he_spoke many \add things\add* to_them in parables saying: Behold, the \add one\add* sowing came_out of_the \add time\add* to_be_sowing.
\v 4 And in the \add time\add* to_be_sowing of_him, some on_one_hand fell along the road, and the birds came and devoured them.
\v 5 On_the_other_hand others fell on the rocky \add places\add*, where it_was_ not _having much soil, and immediately it_sprang_up because_of the to_be_ not _having depth of_soil,
\v 6 but \add the\add*_sun having_risen, it_was_scorched and because_of that to_be_ not _having root it_was_withered.
\v 7 On_the_other_hand others fell on the thorns, and the thorns went_up and choked_ them _out.
\v 8 On_the_other_hand others fell on the the good soil, and was_giving fruit, some on_one_hand \add a\add*_hundred, on_the_other_hand some sixty, on_the_other_hand some thirty.
\v 9 The \add one\add* having ears, let_him_be_hearing.
\v 10 And the apprentices/followers having_approached said to_him: For/Because_ why _reason are_you_speaking to_them in parables?
\v 11 And he answering said to_them: Because to_you_all has_been_given to_know the mysteries of_the kingdom of_the heavens, but to_those it_has_ not _been_given.
\v 12 For/Because whoever is_having, will_be_being_given to_him and he_will_be_being_in_abundance, but whoever is_ not _having, even what he_is_having will_be_being_taken_away from him.
\v 13 Because_of this I_am_speaking in parables to_them, because seeing they_are_ not _seeing, and hearing they_are_ not _hearing, nor are_they_understanding.
\v 14 And the prophecy of_Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊə\sup yāh\sup*) is_being_fulfilled to_them which saying: With_hearing you_all_will_be_hearing but by_no_means you_all_may_ not _understand, and seeing you_all_will_be_seeing but by_no_means you_all_may_ not _perceive.
\v 15 For/Because the heart of_ the this _people was_become_dull, and they_ hardly _heard with_the ears, and they_shut the eyes of_them, lest they_may_see with_the eyes, and they_may_hear with_the ears, and they_may_understand with_the heart, and they_may_return and I_will_be_healing them.
\v 16 But blessed \add are\add* the eyes of_you_all because they_are_seeing, and the ears of_you_all because they_are_hearing.
\v 17 For/Because, truly I_am_saying to_you_all that many prophets and righteous \add men\add* desired to_see what you_all_are_seeing, and they_ not _saw, and to_hear what you_all_are_hearing, and they_ not _heard.
\v 18 Therefore you_all hear the parable of_the \add one\add* having_sown.
\v 19 Everyone hearing the message of_the kingdom and not understanding, the evil \add one\add* is_coming and is_snatching the \add one\add* having_been_sown in the heart of_him. This is the \add one\add* having_been_sown by the road.
\v 20 And the \add one\add* having_been_sown on the rocky, this is the \add one\add* hearing the message and immediately receiving it with joy,
\v 21 and is_having no root in himself, but is temporary, but tribulation or persecution having_become because_of the message, immediately he_is_being_stumbled.
\v 22 And the \add one\add* having_been_sown among the thorns, this is the \add one\add* hearing the message, and the worry of_ the _age and the seduction of_ the _riches is_choking the message, and it_is_becoming unfruitful.
\v 23 And the \add one\add* having_been_sown on the good soil, this is the \add one\add* hearing the message and understanding, who indeed is_bearing_fruit and is_producing, some on_one_hand \add a\add*_hundred, some on_the_other_hand sixty, some on_the_other_hand thirty.
\v 24 He_set_before to_them another parable saying: The kingdom of_the heavens was_likened to_\add a\add*_man having_sown good seed in the field of_him.
\v 25 But at the \add time\add* the people to_be_sleeping, the enemy of_him came and sowed darnels among midst of_the wheat and went_away.
\v 26 But when the grass sprouted and produced fruit, then the darnels was_seen also.
\v 27 And the slaves of_the home_owner having_approached said to_him: Master, you_ not _sowed good seed in the your field? Therefore from_where it_is_having darnels?
\v 28 And he was_saying to_them: \add An\add*_enemy man did this. And the slaves are_saying to_him: Therefore are_you_wanting having_gone_away, may_we_gather them?
\v 29 But he is_saying: No, lest gathering the darnels, you_all_may_uproot the wheat together_with them.
\v 30 Allow both to_be_being_grown_together until the harvest, and in \add the\add*_time of_the harvest I_will_be_saying to_the harvesters: Gather first the darnels and bind them into bundles in_order that to_burn_up them, and gather_together the wheat into the barn of_me.
\v 31 Another parable he_set_before to_them saying, the kingdom of_the heavens is Similar to_\add a\add*_seed of_mustard, which \add a\add*_man having_taken sowed in the field of_him, 
\v 32 which on_one_hand it_is smaller of_all the seeds, on_the_other_hand whenever it_may_be_grown is greater \add than\add* the garden_plants and is_becoming \add a\add*_tree, so_that the birds of_the sky to_come and to_be_nesting in the branches of_it.
\v 33 Another parable he_spoke to_them: the kingdom of_the heavens is Similar to_leaven, which \add a\add*_woman having_taken, hid_in in three satons of_wheat_flour, until all of_which was_leavened.
\v 34 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* spoke all these \add things\add* in parables to_the crowds, and he_was_speaking nothing to_them without \add a\add*_parable, 
\v 35 so_that the \add message\add* may_be_fulfilled having_been_spoken by the prophet saying: I_will_be_opening_up the mouth of_me in parables, I_will_be_uttering \add things\add* having_been_hidden from \add the\add*_foundation of_\add the\add*_world.
\v 36 Then having_sent_away the crowds, he_came into the house. And the apprentices/followers of_him approached to_him saying: Explain to_us the parable of_the darnels of_the field.
\v 37 And he answering said: The \add one\add* sowing the good seed is the son of_ the _Man, 
\v 38 and the field is the world, and the good seed, these are the sons of_the kingdom, and the darnels are the sons of_the evil \add one\add*,
\v 39 and the enemy \add is\add*, the \add one\add* having_sown them, is the devil, and the harvest is \add the\add*_completion of_\add the\add*_age, and the harvesters are messengers.
\v 40 Therefore as the darnels is_being_gathered and is_being_burned_up in_fire, thus it_will_be in the completion of_the age.
\v 41 The son of_ the _man will_be_sending_out the messengers of_him, and they_will_be_gathering out_of the kingdom of_him all the temptations and the \add ones\add* practicing the lawlessness,
\v 42 and they_will_be_throwing them into the furnace of_the fire, there will_be the weeping and the grating of_ the _teeth.
\v 43 Then the righteous will_be_shining_forth as the sun in the kingdom of_the father of_them. The \add one\add* having ears, let_him_be_hearing.
\v 44 The kingdom of_the heavens is similar to_treasure having_been_hidden in the field, which \add a\add*_man having_found hid, and from the joy of_it is_going and is_selling all as_much_as he_is_having, and is_buying the that field.
\v 45 Again the kingdom of_the heavens is similar to_\add a\add*_ merchant _man seeking beautiful pearls, 
\v 46 and having_found one precious pearl, having_gone_away, he_has_sold all \add things\add* as_many_as he_was_having, and bought it.
\v 47 Again the kingdom of_the heavens is similar to_\add a\add*_dragnet having_been_throw into the sea and having_gathered_together of every kind, 
\v 48 which when it_was_filled, having_pulled_up on the shore and having_sat_down, they_gathered the good into containers, and the bad they_throw out.
\v 49 Thus it_will_be in the completion of_the age, the messengers will_be_coming_out, and will_be_setting_apart the evil from \add the\add*_midst of_the righteous,
\v 50 and they_will_be_throwing them into the furnace of_the fire. There will_be the weeping and the grating of_ the _teeth.
\v 51 You_all_understood all these \add things\add*? They_are_saying to_him: Yes.
\v 52 And he said to_them: Because_of this, every scribe having_been_trained in_the kingdom of_the heavens is similar to_\add a\add*_man, \add a\add*_home_owner, who is_sending_forth new \add things\add* and old \add things\add* out_of the treasure of_him.
\v 53 And it_became when the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* finished the these parables, he_withdrew from_there.
\v 54 And having_come into the hometown of_him, he_was_teaching them in the synagogue of_them, so_that them to_be_being_astonished and to_be_saying: From_where to_this \add man\add* the this wisdom and the miracles \add received\add*?
\v 55 Is this not the son of_the carpenter? Not the mother of_him is_being_called Maria/(Mirəyām), and the brothers of_him, Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), and Yōsaʸf/(Yōşēf), and Simōn, and Youdas/(Yəhūdāh)?
\v 56 And are not the sisters of_him all with us? Therefore from_where to_this \add man\add* these \add things\add* all \add received\add*?
\v 57 And they_were_being_offended at him. But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_them: \add A\add*_prophet is not dishonourable, except not/lest in the hometown and in the house of_him.
\v 58 And he_ not _did many miracles there, because_of the unbelief of_them.
\c 14
\v 1 At that the time, Haʸrōdaʸs the quarter_ruler heard the report of_\nd Yaʸsous\nd*,
\v 2 and he_said to_the servants of_him: This is Yōannaʸs the immerser, he was_raised from the dead, and because_of this the miracles are_working in him.
\v 3 For/Because the Haʸrōdaʸs having_apprehended the Yōannaʸs, bound him and put_ \add him\add* _away in prison, because_of Haʸrōidias, the wife of_Filippos, the brother of_him.
\v 4 For/Because the Yōannaʸs was_saying, to_him It_is_ not _permitting for_you to_be_having her.
\v 5 And wanting to_kill_ him _off, he_was_afraid the crowd, because they_were_having him as \add a\add*_prophet.
\v 6 But for_\add the\add*_birthday_celebrations of_ the _Haʸrōdaʸs having_become, the daughter of_ the _Haʸrōidias danced in the midst and brought_pleasure to_ the _Haʸrōdaʸs,
\v 7 whence with \add an\add*_oath, he_promised to_give to_her whatever if she_may_request.
\v 8 And which having_been_urged_on by the mother of_her: Give to_me, she_is_saying: here on \add a\add*_platter, the head of_Yōannaʸs the immerser.
\v 9 And the king was_sorrowed but because_of the oaths and the \add ones\add* reclining, he_commanded \add it\add* to_be_given.
\v 10 And having_sent, he_beheaded Yōannaʸs in the prison.
\v 11 And the head of_him was_brought on \add a\add*_platter, and it_was_given to_the little_girl, and she_brought \add it\add* to_the mother of_her.
\v 12 And having_approached, the apprentices/followers of_him took_away the corpse and buried him, and having_come, they_reported to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 13 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_heard, withdrew from_there by boat to \add a\add*_desolate place by himself. And having_heard \add it\add*, the crowds followed after_him on_foot from the cities.
\v 14 And having_come_out, he_saw \add a\add*_ great _crowd, and he_was_feeling_compassion to them and healed the sick of_them.
\v 15 And evening having_become, the apprentices/followers approached to_him saying: The place is desolate and the hour already passed_by, send_away the crowds, in_order_that having_gone_away into the villages, they_may_buy foods for_themselves.
\v 16 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_them: They_are_having no need to_go_away. You_all give \add something\add* to_them to_eat.
\v 17 And they are_saying to_him: We_are_ not _having \add anything\add* here, except not/lest five loaves and two fishes.
\v 18 And he said: Be_bringing them here to_me.
\v 19 And having_commanded the crowds to_be_sat_down on the grass, and having_taken the five loaves and the two fishes, having_looked_up to the sky, he_blessed and having_broke, gave the loaves to_the apprentices/followers, and the apprentices/followers to_the crowds.
\v 20 And all ate and were_satisfied, and they_took_up the \add part\add* being_leftover of_the fragments, twelve baskets full.
\v 21 And the \add ones\add* eating were about five_thousand men, apart_from women and little_children.
\v 22 And immediately he_compelled the apprentices/followers to_board into the boat, and to_be_going_before him to the \add side\add* across, until of_which he_may_send_away the crowds.
\v 23 And having_sent_away the crowds, he_went_up on the mountain by himself to_pray. And evening having_become, he_was alone there.
\v 24 And the boat was now \add the\add*_midst the of_\add the\add*_sea, being_tormented by the waves, because/for the wind was contrary.
\v 25 And in_\add the\add*_fourth watch of_the night, he_came to them walking on the sea.
\v 26 And the apprentices/followers having_seen him walking on the sea were_disturbed saying, that It_is \add a\add*_ghost, and they_cried_out in the fear.
\v 27 But immediately the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* spoke to_them saying: Be_having_courage, I am \add here\add*, be_ not _fearing.
\v 28 And the Petros answering to_him, said: \nd master\nd*, if you are, command me to_come to you on the waters.
\v 29 And he said: Come. And Petros having_come_down from the boat, walked on the waters and came to the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 30 But seeing the mighty wind, he_was_afraid and having_begun to_be_being_sunk, he_cried_out saying: \nd master\nd*, save me.
\v 31 And immediately the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_stretched_out his hand, took_hold of_him and is_saying to_him: Little_faith \add one\add*, because/for why you_doubted?
\v 32 And of_them having_gone_up into the boat, the wind died_down.
\v 33 And the \add ones\add* in the boat prostrated before_him saying: Truly you_are \add the\add*_son of_\nd god\nd*. 
\v 34 And having_crossed_over, they_came to the land to Gennaʸsaret.
\v 35 And having_recognized him, the men of_ the that _place sent_out to all the that surrounding_region, and brought to_him all the \add ones\add* being sickly,
\v 36 and they_were_begging him that they_may_ only _touch against_the fringe of_the garment of_him, and as_many_as touched were_cured.
\c 15
\v 1 Then Farisaios_\add party\add* and scribes from Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) are_approaching the to_\nd Yaʸsous\nd*, saying,
\v 2 For/Because_ why _reason the apprentices/followers of_you are_breaking_from the tradition of_the elders? For/Because they_are_ not _washing their hands whenever they_may_be_eating bread.
\v 3 And he answering said to_them: For/Because_ why _reason also you_all are_breaking_from the command of_ the _\nd god\nd* because_of the tradition of_you_all?
\v 4 For/Because the \nd god\nd* commanded saying: Be_honouring the father and the mother, and: The \add one\add* speaking_evil of_father or mother, let_be_dying in_death.
\v 5 But you_all are_saying: Whoever wishfully may_say to_the father or the mother: Whatever if you_may_be_benefited by me: \add A\add*_gift,
\v 6 by_no_means he will_ not _be_honouring the father of_him. And you_all_annulled the message of_ the _\nd god\nd* because_of the tradition of_you_all.
\v 7 Hypocrites. Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊə\sup yāh\sup*) rightly prophesied concerning you_all saying,
\v 8 - This people is_honouring me the lips, and the heart of_them is_being_away far_away from me.
\v 9 And they_are_worshipping me uselessly, teaching teachings as_\add the\add*_commands of_humans.
\v 10 And having_called_to the crowd, he_said to_them: Be_hearing and be_understanding. 
\v 11 Not the \add thing\add* coming_in into the mouth is_defiling the person, but the \add thing\add* going_out out_of the mouth, this is_defiling the person.
\v 12 Then the apprentices/followers having_approached are_saying to_him: You_have_known that the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_heard the statement were_offended?
\v 13 But he answering said: Every plant that the the heavenly father of_me not planted will_be_being_uprooted.
\v 14 Leave them, they_are blind guides and, if blind may_be_guiding blind, both will_be_falling into \add a\add*_pit.
\v 15 And the Petros answering said to_him: Interpret the parable to_us.
\v 16 And he said: Are you_all even still unintelligent?
\v 17 Are_you_all_understanding not_yet that everything which entering_in into the mouth, is_entering into the stomach, and is_being_thrown_out to \add the\add*_latrine?
\v 18 But the \add things\add* going_out out_of the mouth, is_coming_out out_of the heart, and_those is_defiling the person.
\v 19 For/Because out_of the heart are_coming_out evil speculations, murders, adulteries, sexual_immorality, thefts, false_witnesses, slander.
\v 20 These is the \add things\add* defiling the person, but the \add one\add* to_eat with_unwashed hands, is_ not _defiling the person.
\v 21 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_come_out from_there, withdrew to the districts of_Turos/(Tsor) and Sidōn/(Tsīdōn).
\v 22 And see, \add a\add*_ member_of_Kananitaʸs _woman having_come_out from the those regions, was_crying_out saying: Show_mercy to_me, \nd master\nd*, son of_Dawid/(Dāvid), the daughter of_me is_being_ sickly _demon_possessed.
\v 23 But he not answered \add a\add*_message to_her. And the apprentices/followers of_him having_approached, were_asking him saying: Send_ her _away, because she_is_crying_out behind us.
\v 24 But he answering said: I_was_ not _sent_out except not/lest to the which having_lost sheep of_\add the\add*_house of_Israaʸl/(Yisərā\sup ʼēl\sup*).
\v 25 But she having_come was_prostrating to_him saying: \nd master\nd*, be_giving_help to_me. 
\v 26 And he answering said: It_is not good to_take the bread of_the children and to_throw \add it\add* to_the little_dogs.
\v 27 But she said: Yes, \nd master\nd*, because/for even the little_dogs is_eating of the the little_crumbs which which falling falling from the table of_the masters of_them.
\v 28 Then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering said to_her: Oh woman, great \add is\add* the faith of_you, let_it_be_become to_you as you_are_wanting. And the daughter of_her was_healed from the that hour.
\v 29 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_departed from_there, came along the sea of_ the _Galilaia/(Gālīl), and having_gone_up on the mountain, he_was_sitting there.
\v 30 And great crowds approached to_him, having with themselves lame, maimed, blind, mute, and many others, and they_laid_ them _down before the feet of_him, and he_healed them, 
\v 31 so_that the crowds to_marvel, seeing mute speaking, maimed healthy, and lame walking, and blind seeing, and they_glorified the \nd god\nd* of_Israaʸl/(Yisərā\sup ʼēl\sup*).
\v 32 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_called_to the apprentices/followers of_him said: I_am_feeling_compassion for the crowd, because already they_are_remaining with_me three days, and they_are_ not _having anything they_may_eat, and I_am_ not _willing to_send_ them _away hungry, lest they_may_be_exhausted on the way.
\v 33 And the apprentices/followers are_saying to_him: From_where to_us in \add a\add*_wilderness, so_many loaves so_as to_satisfy so_much crowd?
\v 34 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: How_many loaves are_you_all_having? And they said: Seven, and \add a\add*_few little_fishes.
\v 35 And having_commanded to_the crowd to_sit_down on the ground,
\v 36 he_took the seven loaves and the fishes, and having_given_thanks he_broke \add them\add* and was_giving \add them\add* to_the apprentices/followers, and the apprentices/followers to_the crowds.
\v 37 And all ate and were_satisfied, and they_took_up seven baskets full, the \add part\add* of_the fragments being_leftover.
\v 38 And the \add ones\add* eating were four_thousand men, apart_from women and little_children.
\v 39 And having_sent_away the crowds, he_boarded into the boat and came to the regions of_Magadan.
\c 16
\v 1 And the Farisaios_\add party\add* and Saddoukaios_\add sect\add* having_approached, tempting \add him\add* they_asked him for_\add a\add*_sign out_of the sky to_show to_them.
\v 2 But he answering said to_them,
\v 3
\v 4 \add A\add*_ evil and adulterous _generation is_seeking_after \add a\add*_sign, and \add a\add*_sign will_ not _be_being_given to_it, except not/lest the sign of_Yōnas/(Yōnāh). And having_left them he_went_away.
\v 5 And the apprentices/followers having_come to the \add side\add* across, they_forgot to_take loaves.
\v 6 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_them: Be_watching and be_taking_heed of the leaven of_the Farisaios_\add party\add* and Saddoukaios_\add sect\add*.
\v 7 And they were_reasoning among themselves saying, that we_ not _took Loaves.
\v 8 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_known, said: Why are_you_all_reasoning among yourselves, little_faith \add ones\add*, because you_all_are_ not _having loaves?
\v 9 You_all_are_ not_yet _understanding, neither are_you_all_remembering the five loaves of_the five_thousand, and how_many baskets you_all_took?
\v 10 Nor the seven loaves of_the four_thousand, and how_many baskets you_all_took?
\v 11 How you_all_are_ not _understanding that I_spoke to_you_all not concerning \add the\add*_loaves? And be_taking_heed of the leaven of_the Farisaios_\add party\add* and Saddoukaios_\add sect\add*.
\v 12 Then they_understood that he_ not _said to_be_taking_heed of the leaven of_the loaves, but of the teaching of_the Farisaios_\add party\add* and Saddoukaios_\add sect\add*.
\v 13 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_come into the districts of_Kaisareia which Filippou, was_asking the apprentices/followers of_him saying: Whom are_ the people _saying the son of_ the _man to_be?
\v 14 And they said: The \add ones\add* on_one_hand Yōannaʸs the immerser, on_the_other_hand others Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*), on_the_other_hand others Yeremias/(Yirəmə\sup yāh\sup*) or one of_the prophets.
\v 15 He_is_saying to_them: But you_all, whom are_saying me to_be?
\v 16 And Simōn Petros answering said: You are the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, the son of_the which living \nd god\nd*.
\v 17 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answering said to_him: You_are blessed, Simōn Barjonah, because flesh and blood not revealed_it to_you, but the father of_me, who \add is\add* in the heavens.
\v 18 And also_I am_saying to_you that you are Petros, but on this the rock I_will_be_building the assembly of_me, and \add the\add*_gates of_Hadaʸs will_ not _be_prevailing against_it.
\v 19 I_will_be_giving the keys of_the kingdom of_the heavens, to_you, and whatever if you_may_bind on the earth, will_be having_been_bound in the heavens, and whatever if you_may_untie/release on the earth, will_be having_been_untied/released in the heavens.
\v 20 Then he_instructed to_the apprentices/followers that they_may_say to_no_one that he is the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 21 From then the \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd* began to_be_showing to_the apprentices/followers of_him that it_is_fitting him to_go_away to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and to_suffer many \add things\add* from the elders, and chief_priests, and scribes, and to_be_killed_off and on_the third day to_be_raised.
\v 22 And the Petros having_taken_aside him, he_began to_be_giving_rebuke to_him saying: Merciful \add be\add* to_you, \nd master\nd*, by_no_means this will_ not _be to_you.
\v 23 But he having_been_turned said to_ the _Petros: Be_going behind me, Satan/(Sāţān). You_are \add a\add*_temptation of_me, because you_are_ not _thinking the \add things\add* of_ the _\nd god\nd*, but the \add things\add* the of_humans.
\v 24 Then the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_the apprentices/followers of_him: If anyone is_wanting to_come after me, let_him_renounce himself, and let_him_take_up the stake of_him, and let_him_be_following after_me.
\v 25 For/Because whoever if may_be_wanting to_save the life of_him will_be_losing it, but whoever wishfully may_lose the life of_him on_account me, will_be_finding it.
\v 26 For/Because what will_ \add a\add*_person _be_being_benefited, if he_may_gain the whole world, but the soul of_him may_be_lost? Or what will_ \add a\add*_person _be_giving as_\add an\add*_exchange for_the soul of_him?
\v 27 For/Because the son of_ the _man is_going to_be_coming in the glory of_the father of_him with the messengers of_him, and then he_will_be_giving_back to_each according_to the practice of_him.
\v 28 Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that are some of_the \add ones\add* having_stood here who by_no_means may_ not _taste of_death, until wishfully they_may_see the son of_ the _man coming in the kingdom of_him.
\c 17
\v 1 And after six days, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_taking the Petros, and Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), and Yōannaʸs, the brother of_him, and he_is_bringing_up them into \add a\add*_ high _mountain by themselves.
\v 2 And he_was_transformed before them, and the face of_him shined as the sun, and the clothes of_him became white as the light.
\v 3 And see, Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) and Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*) was_seen to_them conversing_with with him.
\v 4 And the Petros answering, said to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*: \nd master\nd*, it_is good us to_be here. If you_are_wanting, I_will_be_making three tents here, one for_you, and one for_Mōsaʸs, and one for_Aʸlias.
\v 5 Him still speaking, see, \add a\add*_ bright _cloud overshadowed them, and see, \add a\add*_voice out_of the cloud saying: This is the son of_me, the beloved in whom I_took_pleasure, be_hearing from_him. 
\v 6 And having_heard \add it\add*, the apprentices/followers fell on face of_them and they_were_ exceedingly _afraid.
\v 7 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* approached and having_touched against_them he_said: Be_raised and be_ not _fearing.
\v 8 And having_lifted_up the eyes of_them, they_saw no_one except only \nd Yaʸsous\nd* not/lest himself.
\v 9 And them coming_down from the mountain, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* commanded to_them saying, you_all_may_tell the vision To_no_one, until of_which the son of_ the _man may_rise_up from \add the\add*_dead.
\v 10 And the apprentices/followers of_him asked him saying: Why therefore are_ the scribes _saying that Aʸlias it_is_fitting to_come first?
\v 11 And he answering said: Aʸlias on_one_hand is_coming and will_be_restoring all \add things\add*, 
\v 12 on_the_other_hand I_am_saying to_you_all that Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*) already came and they_ not _knew him, but they_did with him as_much_as they_wanted. Thus also the son of_ the _man is_going to_be_suffering by them.
\v 13 Then the apprentices/followers understood that he_spoke to_them concerning Yōannaʸs the immerser.
\v 14 And of_having_come to the crowd, \add a\add*_man approached to_him kneeling before_him
\v 15 and saying: \nd master\nd*, show_mercy to_the son of_me, because he_is_being_epileptic and is_having sickly, because/for often he_is_falling into the fire, and often into the water.
\v 16 And I_brought him to_the apprentices/followers of_you, and they_were_ not _able to_heal him.
\v 17 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answering said: Oh unbelieving generation and having_been_perverted, until when will_ I _be with you_all? Until when will_I_be_tolerating of_you_all? Be_bringing him here to_me.
\v 18 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* gave_rebuke to_it, and the demon came_out from him, and the boy was_healed from the that hour.
\v 19 Then the apprentices/followers having_approached by themselves to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd* said: for_ Why _reason we were_ not _able to_throw_ it _out?
\v 20 And he is_saying to_them: Because_of the little_faith of_you_all. For/Because truly I_am_saying to_you_all, if you_all_may_be_having faith as \add a\add*_seed of_mustard, you_all_will_be_saying to_ the this _mountain: Move from_here to_there, and it_will_be_moving, and nothing will_be_unattaining for_you_all.
\v 21
\v 22 And them being_gathered in the Galilaia/(Gālīl), the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_them: The son of_ the _man is_going to_be_being_given_over into \add the\add*_hands of_people,
\v 23 and they_will_be_killing_ him _off, and on_the third day he_will_be_being_raised. And they_were_ exceedingly _sorrowed.
\v 24 And them having_come to Kafarnaʼoum, the \add ones\add* receiving the two_drachmas approached to_ the _Petros and said: The teacher of_you_all is_ not _paying the two_drachmas?
\v 25 He_is_saying: Yes. And having_come into the house, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* preceded him saying: What is_supposing to_you, Simōn? The kings of_the earth are_receiving revenues or poll_tax from whom_all? From the sons of_them or from the strangers?
\v 26 the Petros is_saying to_him From the strangers. And he_having_said: From the strangers, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_saying to_him: Consequently surely \add the\add*_free \add ones\add* are the sons.
\v 27 But in_order_that we_may_ not _offend them, having_been_gone to sea, throw \add a\add*_fish_hook and take_up the first fish having_gone_up, and having_opened_up the mouth of_it, you_will_be_finding \add a\add*_stater, having_taken that, give to_them for me and you.
\c 18
\v 1 In that the hour the apprentices/followers approached to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd* saying: Who consequently is \add the\add*_greater in the kingdom of_the heavens?
\v 2 And having_called_to \add a\add*_little_child, he_stood it in midst of_them
\v 3 and said: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, if you_all _may_ not _be_turned and may_become as the little_children, by_no_means you_all_may_ not _come_in into the kingdom of_the heavens.
\v 4 Therefore whoever will_be_humbling himself as the this little_child, this \add one\add* is the greater in the kingdom of_the heavens.
\v 5 And whoever if may_receive one such little_child in the name of_me, is_receiving me.
\v 6 But whoever wishfully may_stumble one of_ the these _little \add ones\add* which believing in me, it_is_benefitting for_him that \add a\add*_ heavy _grinding_stone may_be_hanged around the neck of_him, and may_be_sunk in the depth of_the sea.
\v 7 Woe to_the world because_of the temptations. For/Because it_is necessity the temptations to_come, however woe to_the that person by whom the temptation is_coming. 
\v 8 And if the hand of_you or the foot of_you is_stumbling you, cut_ it _off and throw \add it\add* from you, it_is better for_you to_come_in into the life maimed or lame, than to_be_thrown into the the eternal fire having two hands or two feet.
\v 9 And if the eye of_you is_stumbling you, pluck_out it and throw \add it\add* from you, it_is better for_you to_come_in into the life one-eyed, than to_be_thrown into the geenna of_ the _fire having two eyes.
\v 10 Be_seeing you_all_may_ not _despise of_one of_ the these _little \add ones\add*, because/for I_am_saying to_you_all that the messengers of_them in \add the\add*_heavens, through everything are_seeing the face of_the father of_me, who \add is\add* in \add the\add*_heavens.
\v 11
\v 12 What is_it_supposing to_you_all? If it_may_become to_\add a\add*_certain man \add a\add*_hundred sheep, and one of them may_be_strayed, not, having_left the ninety nine on the mountains and having_been_gone, is_seeking the \add sheep\add* being_strayed?
\v 13 And if he_may_become to_find it, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that he_is_rejoicing over it more than over the ninety nine which not having_been_strayed.
\v 14 Thus is not \add the\add*_will before the father of_you_all, who \add is\add* in \add the\add*_heavens, that may_perish one of_ the these _little \add ones\add*.
\v 15 And if the brother of_you may_sin, be_going, rebuke him between you and him only. If he_may_hear from_you, you_gained the brother of_you.
\v 16 But if he_may_ not _hear, take one or two more with you in_order_that on \add the\add*_mouth of_two or three witnesses, every message may_be_established.
\v 17 And if he_may_refuse_to_hear from_them, tell to_the assembly. And if he_may_ also _refuse_to_hear from_the assembly, him_let_be to_you as the pagan and the tax_collector.
\v 18 Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, as_much_as wishfully you_all_may_bind on the earth, will_be having_been_bound in heaven, and as_much_as if you_all_may_untie/release on the earth, will_be having_been_untied/released in heaven.
\v 19 Again truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that if two of you_all on the earth may_agree_together concerning any matter, of_whatever if they_may_request, it_will_be_becoming for_them by the father of_me, who \add is\add* in \add the\add*_heavens.
\v 20 For/Because where are two or three having_been_gathered_together in the my name, there I_am in \add the\add*_midst of_them.
\v 21 Then the Petros having_approached, said to_him: \nd master\nd*, how_often will_ the brother of_me _be_sinning against me, and I_will_be_forgiving to_him? Up_to seven_times?
\v 22 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_saying to_him: I_am_ not _saying to_you up_to seven_times, but up_to seventy_times seven. 
\v 23 Because_of this the kingdom of_the heavens was_likened to_\add a\add*_man, \add a\add*_king, who wanted to_settle_accounts account with the slaves of_him.
\v 24 And of_him having_begun to_be_settling_accounts, one \add a\add*_debtor of_ten_thousand talantons\add _of_silver\add* was_brought to_him.
\v 25 But of_him not having \add means\add* to_give_back, the master commanded him to_be_sold, and the wife, and the children, and all \add things\add* as_many_as was_having, and \add payment\add* to_be_given_back.
\v 26 Therefore the slave having_fallen, was_prostrating to_him saying: Master, be_patient with me, and I_will_be_giving_ all \add things\add* _back to_you.
\v 27 And the master having_been_feeling_compassion, of_ the that _slave sent_ him _away, and he_forgave the loan to_him.
\v 28 But the that slave having_come_out, found one of_the fellow-slaves of_him, who was_owing \add a\add*_hundred daʸnarion_\add coins\add* to_him, and having_apprehended him, he_was_strangling \add him\add* saying: Give_back if anything you_are_owing.
\v 29 Therefore the fellow-slave of_him having_fallen, was_imploring him saying: Be_patient with me, and I_will_be_giving_back to_you.
\v 30 And which he_was_ not _willing, but having_gone_away, he_throw him into prison, until he_may_give_back the \add thing\add* being_owed.
\v 31 Therefore the fellow-slaves of_him, having_seen the \add things\add* having_become, they_were_ exceedingly _sorrowed, and having_come they_explained to_the master of_themselves all the \add things\add* having_become.
\v 32 Then the master of_him, having_called_to him, is_saying to_him: Evil slave, I_forgave to_you all that the obligation, because you_implored me.
\v 33 Not was_it_fitting you also to_show_mercy to_the fellow-slave of_you, as also_I shown_mercy to_you?
\v 34 And the master of_him having_been_angered, gave_ him _over to_the tormentors, until of_which he_may_give_back everything which being_owed to_him.
\v 35 Thus also the the heavenly father of_me will_be_doing to_you_all, if you_all_may_ not _forgive each to_the brother of_him from the hearts of_you_all.
\c 19
\v 1 And it_became, when the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* finished the these messages, he_withdrew from the Galilaia/(Gālīl) and came to the regions of_ the _Youdaia beyond the Yordanaʸs/(Yarəddēn).
\v 2 And great crowds followed after_him, and he_healed them there.
\v 3 And \add the\add*_Farisaios_\add party\add* approached to_him, testing him and saying: - Is_it_permitting to_send_away the wife of_him according_to any cause?
\v 4 And which answering he_said: You_all_ not _read that he having_made \add them\add* from beginning: made them male and female?
\v 5 And he_said: On_account of_this \add a\add*_man will_be_leaving his father and his mother, and will_be_being_joined_together with_the wife of_him, and the two will_be into one flesh?
\v 6 So_that they_ no_longer _are two, but one flesh. Therefore what the \nd god\nd* joined_together, let_ man not _be_separating.
\v 7 They_are_saying to_him: Therefore why Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) commanded to_give \add a\add*_scroll of_divorce and to_send_ her _away?
\v 8 He_is_saying to_them, that For/Because the hard_heart of_you_all, Mōsaʸs permitted to_you_all to_send_away the wives of_you_all, but from \add the\add*_beginning it_has_ not _become thus.
\v 9 And I_am_saying to_you_all that whoever wishfully may_send_away the wife of_him not/lest for sexual_immorality, and may_marry another, is_causing_adultery. And the \add one\add* having_been_sent_away, marrying is_causing_adultery.
\v 10 The apprentices/followers are_saying to_him: If thus is the cause of_the husband with the wife, it_is_ not _benefitting to_marry.
\v 11 But he said to_them: Not all are_accepting the this statement, but \add those\add* to_whom it_has_been_given.
\v 12 For/Because there_are eunuchs who were_born thus from womb of_mother, and there_are eunuchs who were_castrated by the people, and there_are eunuchs who castrated themselves because_of the kingdom of_the heavens. The \add one\add* being_able to_be_accepting \add it\add*, him _let_be_accepting \add it\add*.
\v 13 Then little_children were_brought to_him in_order_that he_may_lay_on his hands on_them and he_may_pray, and the apprentices/followers gave_rebuke to_them.
\v 14 But the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said Allow the little_children and not be_forbidding them to_come to me, because/for the kingdom of_the heavens is the of_such \add children\add*.
\v 15 And having_laid_on his hands on_them, he_was_gone from_there.
\v 16 And see, one having_approached to_him said: Teacher, what good may_I_do in_order_that I_may_have eternal life?
\v 17 And he said to_him: Why are_you_asking me about the good? one is the good. But if you_are_wanting to_come_in into the life, be_keeping the commands.
\v 18 He_is_saying to_him: Which \add ones\add*? And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said, the You will_ not _be_murdering, you will_ not _be_committing_adultery, you will_ not _be_stealing, you will_ not _be_giving_false_testimony,
\v 19 Be_honouring your father and your mother, and: You_will_be_loving the neighbor of_you as yourself.
\v 20 The young_man is_saying to_him: I_kept all These \add things\add*, what am_I_lacking still?
\v 21 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_saying to_him: If you_are_wanting to_be perfect, be_going, sell the \add things\add* possessing of_you and give to_\add the\add*_poor and you_will_be_having treasure in \add the\add*_heavens, and come, be_following after_me.
\v 22 But the young_man having_heard, the statement, he_went_away being_sorrowed, because/for he_was having many properties.
\v 23 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_the apprentices/followers of_him: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that \add a\add*_rich \add one\add* will_be_coming_in into the kingdom of_the heavens difficultly.
\v 24 And again I_am_telling to_you_all, it_is easier for_\add a\add*_camel to_pass_through through \add the\add*_eye of_\add a\add*_needle than \add a\add*_rich \add one\add* to_come_in into the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 25 And the apprentices/followers having_heard, were_being_ exceedingly _astonished saying: Who consequently is_able to_be_saved?
\v 26 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_focused_in said to_them: With humans this is impossible, but with \nd god\nd* all \add things\add* possible.
\v 27 Then the Petros answering said to_him: Behold, we left all \add things\add* and followed after_you, what consequently will_be to_us?
\v 28 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_them: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that you_all who having_followed after_me in the regeneration, whenever the son of_ the _man may_sit_down on \add the\add*_throne of_glory of_him, you_all also will_be_sitting on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of_ the _Israaʸl/(Yisərā\sup ʼēl\sup*).
\v 29 And everyone who left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or farms, on_account the name of_me, will_be_receiving hundred_fold and will_be_inheriting eternal life.
\v 30 But many \add the\add*_first will_be \add the\add*_last, and \add the\add*_last first.
\c 20
\v 1 For/Because the kingdom of_the heavens is similar to_\add a\add*_man, \add a\add*_home_owner, who came_out together_with in_the_morning to_hire workers for the vineyard of_him.
\v 2 And having_agreed_together with the workers for \add a\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add* for_the day, he_sent_ them _out into the vineyard of_him.
\v 3 And having_come_out about \add the\add*_third hour, he_saw others having_stood idle in the marketplace, 
\v 4 and to_those he_said: You_all also be_going into the vineyard, and whatever if may_be right, I_will_be_giving to_you_all.
\v 5 And they went_away. Having_come_out again about \add the\add*_sixth and ninth hour, he_did likewise.
\v 6 And having_come_out about the eleventh, he_found others having_stood, and he_is_saying to_them: Why have_you_all_stood here idle all the day?
\v 7 They_are_saying to_him: Because no_one hired us. He_is_saying to_them: You_all be_going also into the vineyard.
\v 8 And having_become evening, the master of_the vineyard is_saying to_the manager of_him: Call the workers and give_back to_them the wage, having_begun from the last to the first.
\v 9 And the \add ones\add* having_come about the eleventh hour each received \add a\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add*.
\v 10 And the first \add ones\add* having_come thought that they_will_be_receiving more, but they each also received \add a\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add*.
\v 11 And having_received, they_were_grumbling against the home_owner
\v 12 saying: These the last \add ones\add* worked one hour, and you_made them equal to_us, to_the \add ones\add* having_borne the burden of_the day and the scorching_heat.
\v 13 But he answering of_them said to_one Friend, I_am_ not _doing_wrong to_you. Not you_agreed_together for_\add a\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add* with_me?
\v 14 Take_up what \add is\add* your and be_going, but I_am_wanting to_give to_this the last as also to_you.
\v 15 Or not is_it_permitting for_me, what I_am_willing to_do with the mine? Or is the eye of_you evil, because I am good?
\v 16 Thus the last will_be first, and the first last.
\v 17 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* going_up to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), took the twelve apprentices/followers by themselves, and on the way he_said to_them,
\v 18 Behold, we_are_going_up to Hierousalaʸm, and the son of_ the _man will_be_being_given_over to_the chief_priests and scribes, and they_will_be_condemning him to_death,
\v 19 and they_will_be_giving_ him _over to_the pagans, in_order that to_mock, and to_flog, and to_execute_on_a_stake, and on_the third day he_will_be_rising_up.
\v 20 Then the mother of_the sons of_Zebedaios approached to_him with the sons of_her, prostrating and requesting something from him.
\v 21 And he said to_her: What are_you_wanting? She_is_saying to_him: Say that these the two sons of_me may_sit_down, one on \add the\add*_right and one on \add the\add*_left of_you in the kingdom of_you.
\v 22 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering said: You_all_have_ not _known what you_all_are_requesting. Are_you_all_being_able to_drink the cup which I am_going to_be_drinking? They_are_saying to_him: We_are_being_able.
\v 23 He_is_saying to_them: On_one_hand you_all_will_be_drinking the cup of_me, on_the_other_hand which to_sit_down on \add the\add*_right of_me and on \add the\add*_left, is not mine to_give, but for_whom it_has_been_prepared by the father of_me.
\v 24 And having_heard, the ten resented about the two brothers.
\v 25 But the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_called_to them said: You_all_have_known that the rulers of_the pagans are_exercising_mastership over_them, and the great \add ones\add* are_exercising_authority over_them.
\v 26 It_will_ not _be thus among you_all, but whoever if among you_all may_be_wanting to_become great, he_will_be servant of_you_all,
\v 27 and whoever wishfully among you_all may_be_wanting to_be first, he_will_be slave of_you_all, 
\v 28 as the son of_ the _man came not to_be_served, but to_serve and to_give the life of_him \add a\add*_ransom for many.
\v 29 And them going_out from Yeriⱪō/(Yərīḩō), \add a\add*_ great _crowd followed after_him.
\v 30 And see, two blind \add men\add* sitting beside the road, having_heard that \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_passing_by, they_cried_out saying, show_mercy to_us, \nd master\nd*, son of_Dawid/(Dāvid).
\v 31 And the crowd warned to_them that they_may_keep_silent. But they cried_out greater saying: \nd master\nd*, son of_Dawid, show_mercy to_us.
\v 32 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_stopped, called them and said: What are_you_all_wanting I_may_do for_you_all?
\v 33 They_are_saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, that may_be_opening_up the eyes of_us.
\v 34 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_been_feeling_compassion, touched against_the eyes of_them, and immediately they_received_sight and they_followed after_him.
\c 21
\v 1 And when they_neared to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) and came to Baʸthfagaʸ to the Mount of_ the _Olives, then \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* sent_out two apprentices/followers
\v 2 saying to_them: Be_going into the village which in_front_of of_you_all, and immediately you_all_will_be_finding \add a\add*_donkey having_been_bound and \add a\add*_colt with her, having_untied \add them\add* bring \add them\add* to_me.
\v 3 And if anyone may_say anything to_you_all, you_all_will_be_saying, that The \nd master\nd* is_having need of_them, and immediately he_will_be_sending_ them _out.
\v 4 And this all has_become, in_order_that the \add message\add* may_be_fulfilled having_been_spoken by the prophet saying,
\v 5 Say to_the daughter of_Siōn/(Tsiuōn): Behold, the king of_you is_coming to_you, gentle and having_mounted on \add a\add*_donkey and on \add a\add*_colt, \add the\add*_son of_\add a\add*_donkey.
\v 6 And the apprentices/followers having_been_gone, and having_done as the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* directed to_them,
\v 7 they_brought the donkey and the colt, and they_put_on their coats on them, and he_sat_on on them.
\v 8 And the very_great crowd spread the coats of_themselves on the road, and others were_cutting_off branches from the trees, and were_spreading \add them\add* on the road.
\v 9 And the crowds which going_before him and the \add ones\add* following were_crying_out saying: Honoured_saviour to_the son of_Dawid/(Dāvid). The \add one\add* coming in \add the\add*_name of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* having_been_blessed. Honoured_saviour in the highest. 
\v 10 And of_him having_come_in into Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), all the city was_shaken saying: Who is this?
\v 11 And the crowds were_saying: This is the prophet \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, the \add one\add* from Nazaret of_ the _Galilaia/(Gālīl).
\v 12 And \nd Yaʸsous\nd* came_in into the temple, and he_throw_out all the \add ones\add* selling and buying in the temple, and he_overturned the tables of_the moneychangers, and the seats of_the \add ones\add* selling the doves.
\v 13 And he_is_saying to_them: It_has_been_written: The house of_me will_be_being_called \add a\add*_house of_prayer, but you_all are_making it \add a\add*_hideout of_robbers.
\v 14 And blind and lame in the temple approached, to_him, and he_healed them.
\v 15 But the chief_priests and the scribes having_seen the wonders that he_did, and the children which crying_out in the temple and saying: Honoured_saviour to_the son of_Dawid, they_resented
\v 16 and said to_him: Are_you_hearing what these are_saying? And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: Yes, you_all_ never _read, that You_prepared praise out_of mouth of_infants and nursing,?
\v 17 And having_left them, he_came_out out the city to Baʸthania, and was_lodged there.
\v 18 And in_the_morning, setting_out into the city, he_hungered.
\v 19 And having_seen one fig_tree on the road, he_came to it and found nothing on it, except not/lest only leaves, and he_is_saying to_it: Fruit may_ no_longer _become from you for the age. And immediately the fig_tree was_withered.
\v 20 And the apprentices/followers having_seen \add it\add*, marvelled saying: How was_ the fig_tree immediately _withered?
\v 21 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answering said to_them: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, if you_all_may_be_having faith and not may_be_doubted, not only will_you_all_be_doing the \add miracle\add* of_the fig_tree, but even_if you_all_may_say to_the this mountain: Be_taken_away and be_thrown into the sea, it_will_be_becoming.
\v 22 And all \add things\add*, as_many_as wishfully you_all_may_request in the prayer believing, you_all_will_be_receiving.
\v 23 And with_him having_come into the temple teaching, the chief_priests and the elders of_the people approached to_him saying: By what authority are_you_doing these \add things\add*? And who gave the this authority to_you?
\v 24 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering, said to_them: Also_I Will_be_asking you_all one message, which if you_all_may_tell to_me, also_I will_be_saying to_you_all by what authority I_am_doing these \add things\add*.
\v 25 The immersion which of_Yōannaʸs, from_where was_it? From heaven or from humans? And they were_reasoning among themselves saying: If we_may_say: From heaven, he_will_be_saying to_us: Therefore for_ why _reason you_all_ not _believed in_him?
\v 26 But if we_may_say: From humans, we_are_fearing the crowd, because/for all are_having the Yōannaʸs as \add a\add*_prophet.
\v 27 And answering to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* \add they\add*_said: We_have_ not _known. He was_saying to_them also: Neither I am_telling to_you_all by what authority I_am_doing these \add things\add*.
\v 28 But what is_it_supposing to_you_all? \add A\add*_man was_having two children. And having_approached to_the_ first _\add one\add* he_said: Child, be_going today, be_working in the vineyard of_me.
\v 29 And he answering said: I_am_ not _willing, later having_been_regretful, he_went_away.
\v 30 And having_approached to_the other \add child\add*, he_said likewise. And he answering said: I \add will\add*, master, but went_ not _away.
\v 31 Which of the two did the will of_the father? They_are_saying: The first. The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that the tax_collectors and the prostitutes are_going_before you_all into the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 32 For/Because Yōannaʸs came to you_all in \add the\add*_way of_righteousness, and you_all_ not _believed in_him, but the tax_collectors and the prostitutes believed in_him, and you_all having_seen, you_all_were_ not _regretful later which to_believe in_him.
\v 33 Hear another parable: \add a\add*_man was \add a\add*_home_owner, who planted \add a\add*_vineyard, and put_ \add a\add*_fence _around to_it: and dug \add a\add*_wine-press in it, and built \add a\add*_tower, and rented_ it _out to_tenant_farmers, and travelled.
\v 34 And when the season of_the fruits neared, he_sent_out the slaves of_him to the tenant_farmers, to_receive the fruits of_him.
\v 35 And the tenant_farmers having_taken the slaves of_him, on_one_hand that they_beat, on_the_other_hand that they_killed_off, on_the_other_hand that they_threw_stones.
\v 36 Again he_sent_out other slaves, more than_the first, and they_did likewise to_them.
\v 37 But later he_sent_out the son of_him to them saying: They_will_be_being_swayed by_the son of_me.
\v 38 But the tenant_farmers having_seen the son, said among themselves: This is the heir, come, we_may_kill_ him _off and we_may_have the inheritance of_him.
\v 39 And having_taken him, they_throw_out \add him\add* out the vineyard and they_killed_ \add him\add* _off.
\v 40 Therefore whenever the master of_the vineyard may_come, what he_will_be_doing to_ the those _tenant_farmers?
\v 41 They_are_saying to_him: He_will_be_destroying them evil \add ones\add* miserably, and will_be_renting_out the vineyard to_other tenant_farmers, who will_be_giving_back to_him the fruits in the seasons of_them.
\v 42 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_saying to_them: You_all_ never _read in the scriptures: \add The\add*_stone which the \add ones\add* building rejected, this was_become for \add the\add*_head of_\add the\add*_corner, this became from \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, and it_is marvellous in \add the\add*_eyes of_us?
\v 43 Because_of this I_am_saying to_you_all, that the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* will_be_being_taken_away from you_all and it_will_be_being_given to_\add a\add*_people producing the fruits of_it.
\v 44 And the \add one\add* having_fallen on the this stone, will_be_being_shattered, on but whomever wishfully it_may_fall, it_will_be_pulverizing him.
\v 45 And the chief_priests and the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_heard the parables of_him, they_knew that he_is_speaking about them.
\v 46 And seeking to_apprehend him, they_were_afraid the crowds, because they_were_having him for \add a\add*_prophet.
\c 22
\v 1 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering, again spoke to_them in parables saying,
\v 2 The kingdom of_the heavens was_likened to_\add a\add*_man, \add a\add*_king, who made \add a\add*_wedding_festivities for_the son of_him.
\v 3 And sent_out the slaves of_him, to_call the \add ones\add* having_been_invited to the wedding_festivities, and they_were_ not _willing to_come.
\v 4 Again he_sent_out other slaves saying: Say to_the \add ones\add* having_been_invited: Behold, I_have_prepared the dinner of_me, the bulls of_me, and the grain_fed having_been_sacrificed, and all \add things\add* are_ready, come to the wedding_festivities.
\v 5 But they having_neglected went_away, on_one_hand that \add one\add* to his own field, on_the_other_hand that \add one\add* to the business of_him.
\v 6 And the rest having_apprehended the slaves of_him, they_mistreated and they_killed_ \add them\add* _off.
\v 7 But the king was_angered, and having_sent the armies of_him, destroyed the those murderers, and inflamed the city of_them.
\v 8 Then he_is_saying to_the slaves of_him: On_one_hand the wedding is ready, on_the_other_hand the \add ones\add* having_been_invited were not worthy.
\v 9 Therefore be_going in the thoroughfares of_the roads, and invite as_many_as if you_all_may_find to the wedding_festivities.
\v 10 And the those slaves having_come_out into the roads, they_gathered_together all whom they_found, both evil and good, and the wedding was_filled of_reclining \add ones\add*.
\v 11 But the king having_come_in to_see the \add ones\add* reclining, he_saw there \add a\add*_man not having_dressed_in clothing of_wedding, 
\v 12 and he_is_saying to_him: Friend, how you_came_in here not having clothing of_wedding? And he was_silenced.
\v 13 Then the king said to_the servants: Having_bound \add the\add*_feet and hands of_him, throw_ him _out into the the outer darkness, there will_be the weeping and the grating of_ the _teeth.
\v 14 For/Because many are called, but few chosen.
\v 15 Then the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_been_gone, took counsel so_that they_may_trap him in message.
\v 16 And they_are_sending_out to_him the apprentices/followers of_them with the supporters_of_Haʸrōdaʸs saying: Teacher, we_have_known that you_are true, and you_are_teaching the way of_ the _\nd god\nd* in truth, and it_is_ not _caring to_you about no_one, because/for you_are_ not _looking on appearance of_people.
\v 17 Therefore tell to_us, what is_it_supposing to_you? Is_it_permitting to_give poll_tax to_Kaisar or not?
\v 18 But the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_known the wickedness of_them, he_said: Why are_you_all_testing me, hypocrites?
\v 19 Show to_me the coin of_the poll_tax. And they brought \add a\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add* to_him.
\v 20 And he_is_saying to_them: Of_whose_ The image _\add is\add* this and the inscription?
\v 21 They_are_saying: Of_Kaisar. Then he_is_saying to_them: Therefore give_back the \add things\add* of_Kaisar to_Kaisar, and the \add things\add* of_ the _\nd god\nd* to_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 22 And having_heard, they_marvelled, and having_left him they_went_away.
\v 23 On that the day Saddoukaios_\add sect\add* approached to_him saying not to_be \add a\add*_resurrection, and they_asked him
\v 24 saying: Teacher, Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) said: If anyone may_die_off not having children, the brother of_him will_be_marrying the wife of_him, and he_will_be_raising_up children for_the brother of_him.
\v 25 And they_were seven brothers among us, and the first having_married died, and not having seed, left the wife of_him to_the brother of_him.
\v 26 Likewise also the second, and the third, to the seven,
\v 27 and last of_all, the woman died_off.
\v 28 Therefore in the resurrection, she_will_be \add the\add*_wife of_which of_the seven? For/Because all had her.
\v 29 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answering said to_them: You_all_are_being_strayed, not having_known the scriptures nor the power of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 30 For/Because in the resurrection, they_are_ neither _marrying nor are_being_betrothed, but they_are like messengers in the heaven.
\v 31 But concerning the resurrection of_the dead, you_all_ not _read the \add message\add* having_been_spoken to_you_all by the \nd god\nd* saying,
\v 32 I am the \nd god\nd* of_Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱərāhām), and the \nd god\nd* of_Isaʼak/(Yiʦəḩāq), and the \nd god\nd* of_Yakōb/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ)? The \nd god\nd* is not of_\add the\add*_dead, but of_\add the\add*_living.
\v 33 And the crowds having_heard, they_were_being_astonished at the teaching of_him.
\v 34 But the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_heard that he_silenced the Saddoukaios_\add sect\add*, were_gathered_together with the same.
\v 35 And one of them, \add a\add*_lawyer testing him asked,
\v 36 Teacher, which command \add is\add* great in the law?
\v 37 And he was_saying to_him: You_will_be_loving \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* the \nd god\nd* of_you with all heart of_you, and with all soul of_you, and with all the mind of_you.
\v 38 This is the great and first command.
\v 39 \add The\add*_second, similar to_it: You_will_be_loving the neighbor of_you as yourself.
\v 40 All the law and the prophets is_being_hanged on these the two commands.
\v 41 And the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_been_gathered_together, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* asked them
\v 42 saying: What is_supposing to_you_all concerning the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*? Of_whom son is_he? They_are_saying to_him: Of_the \add son\add* of_Dawid/(Dāvid).
\v 43 He_is_saying to_them: Therefore how is_ Dawid in \nd spirit\nd* _calling him \nd master\nd* saying,
\v 44 \add The\add*_\nd master\nd* said to_the \nd master\nd* of_me: Be_sitting on \add the\add*_right of_me, until wishfully I_may_put the enemies of_you beneath for_the feet of_you?
\v 45 Therefore if Dawid is_calling him: \nd master\nd*, how is_he \add the\add*_son of_him?
\v 46 And no_one was_able to_answer \add a\add*_message to_him, nor dared anyone from that the day to_ask him no_longer.
\c 23
\v 1 Then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* spoke to_the crowds and to_the apprentices/followers of_him
\v 2 saying: The scribes and the Farisaios_\add party\add* sat_down on the seat of_Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh).
\v 3 Therefore all \add things\add* as_much_as wishfully they_may_tell to_you_all, do and be_keeping, but be_ not _doing according_to the works of_them, because/for they_are_speaking and they_are_ not _doing.
\v 4 And they_are_binding heavy and unbearable burdens, and they_are_laying_ \add them\add* _on on the shoulders of_ the _people, but they are_ not _willing to_move them with_the finger of_them.
\v 5 But all the works of_them, they_are_doing in_order that to_be_seen by_the people. For/Because they_are_widening the phylacteries of_them and they_are_magnifying their tassels.
\v 6 And they_are_loving the best_place at the suppers, and the best_seats in the synagogues,
\v 7 and the greetings in the marketplaces, and to_be_being_called My_great_\add one\add* by the people.
\v 8 But you_all may_ not _be_called My_great_\add one\add*, because/for one is the instructor of_you_all, and you_all are all brothers.
\v 9 And you_all_may_ not _call of_you on the earth father, because/for one is the the heavenly father of_you_all.
\v 10 Nor may_you_all_be_called instructors, because one is \add the\add*_instructor of_you_all, the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 11 And the greater of_you_all will_be servant of_you_all.
\v 12 And whoever will_be_exalting himself, will_be_being_humbled, and whoever will_be_humbling himself, will_be_being_exalted.
\v 13 But woe to_you_all, scribes and Farisaios_\add party\add*, hypocrites. Because you_all_are_shutting the kingdom of_the heavens before the people, because/for you_all are_ neither _coming_in, nor are_you_all_allowing the \add ones\add* coming_in to_come_in.
\v 14
\v 15 Woe to_you_all, scribes and Farisaios_\add party\add*, hypocrites. Because you_all_are_going_around the sea and the dry \add land\add* to_make one convert, and whenever he_may_become, you_all_are_making him \add a\add*_son of_geenna twice_more \add than\add* you_all.
\v 16 Woe to_you_all, blind guides, you_all saying: Whoever wishfully may_swear by the temple, it_is nothing, but whoever wishfully may_swear by the gold of_the temple is_owing.
\v 17 Foolish and blind. For/Because which is greater, the gold or the temple which having_sanctified the gold?
\v 18 And: Whoever wishfully may_swear by the altar, it_is nothing, but whoever wishfully may_swear by the gift which on it is_owing.
\v 19 Foolish and blind. For/Because which greater, the gift, or the altar which sanctifying the gift?
\v 20 Therefore the \add one\add* having_swore by the altar, is_swearing by it and by all the \add things\add* on it.
\v 21 And the \add one\add* having_swore by the temple, is_swearing by it and by the \add one\add* dwelling_in it.
\v 22 And the \add one\add* having_swore by the heaven, is_swearing by the throne of_ the _\nd god\nd* and by the \add one\add* sitting on it.
\v 23 Woe to_you_all, scribes and Farisaios_\add party\add*, hypocrites. Because you_all_are_tithing the mint and the dill and the cummin, and you_all_left the heavier of_the law: the justice and the mercy and the faith. But it_was_fitting to_do these \add things\add*, and_those not to_leave.
\v 24 Blind guides. You_all straining_out the gnat and swallowing_up the camel. 
\v 25 Woe to_you_all, scribes and Farisaios_\add party\add*, hypocrites. Because you_all_are_cleansing the \add part\add* outside of_the cup and of_the dish, but inside they_are_being_full of theft and intemperance.
\v 26 Blind Farisaios_\add party_member\add*. Cleanse first the \add part\add* inside of_the cup and of_the dish, in_order_that the \add part\add* outside of_them may_ also _become clean.
\v 27 Woe to_you_all, scribes and Farisaios_\add party\add*, hypocrites. Because you_all_are_being_like to_tombs having_been_whitewashed, which on_one_hand are_appearing beautiful outwardly, on_the_other_hand inside they_are_being_full of_bones of_\add the\add*_dead and of_all impurity.
\v 28 Thus also on_one_hand you_all are_being_seen righteous outwardly by_the people, on_the_other_hand inside you_all_are full of_hypocrisy and lawlessness.
\v 29 Woe to_you_all, scribes and Farisaios_\add party\add*, hypocrites. Because you_all_are_building the tombs of_the prophets, and you_all_are_adorning the tombs of_the righteous
\v 30 and you_all_are_saying: If we_were in the days of_the fathers of_us, we_ would not _were partners with_them in the blood of_the prophets.
\v 31 So_then you_all_are_testifying to_yourselves that you_all_are sons of_the \add ones\add* having_murdered the prophets.
\v 32 Also you_all fill the measure of_the fathers of_you_all.
\v 33 Serpents, brood of_vipers, how may_you_all_escape from the judgment of_ the _geenna?
\v 34 Because_of this, see, I am_sending_out prophets and wise \add ones\add*, and scribes to you_all. You_all_will_be_killing_off and you_all_will_be_executing_on_a_stake of them, and you_all_will_be_flogging of them in the synagogues of_you_all, and you_all_will_be_persecuting from city to city, 
\v 35 so_that all righteous blood being_poured_out on the earth may_come on you_all, from the blood of_Abel/(Heⱱel) the righteous, to the blood of_Zaⱪarias son of_Baraⱪias/(Berekə\sup yāh\sup*), whom you_all_murdered between the temple and the altar.
\v 36 Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, all these \add things\add* will_be_coming on the this generation.
\v 37 Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), Hierousalaʸm, the \add city\add* killing_off the prophets and throwing_stones the \add ones\add* having_been_sent_out to her. How_often I_wanted to_gather_together the children of_you, which manner \add a\add*_hen is_gathering_together the chicks of_her under her wings, and you_all_ not _willed.
\v 38 Behold, the house of_you_all is_being_left desolate to_you_all. 
\v 39 For/Because I_am_saying to_you_all, by_no_means you_all_may_ not _see me from now until wishfully you_all_may_say: The \add one\add* coming in name of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* having_been_blessed. 
\c 24
\v 1 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_come_out from the temple, was_going and approached the apprentices/followers of_him to_show to_him the buildings of_the temple.
\v 2 And he answering said to_them: You_all_are_ not _seeing all these \add things\add*? Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, by_no_means may_ not _be_left here stone on stone, which will_ not _be_being_torn_down.
\v 3 And him sitting on the Mount of_ the _Olives, the apprentices/followers approached to_him by themselves saying: Tell to_us when these \add things\add* will_be, and what \add is\add* the sign of_the your coming and \add the\add*_completion of_the age?
\v 4 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering said to_them: Be_watching_out lest anyone may_mislead you_all.
\v 5 For/Because many will_be_coming in the name of_me saying: I am the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, and they_will_be_misleading many.
\v 6 And you_all_will_be_going to_be_hearing wars, and reports of_wars. Be_watching, be_ not _being_alarmed, because/for it_is_fitting to_become, but the end is not_yet.
\v 7 For/Because nation will_be_being_raised against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and will_be famines and earthquakes in places.
\v 8 But all these \add are\add* \add the\add*_beginning of_birth_pains.
\v 9 Then they_will_be_giving_ you_all _over to tribulation, and they_will_be_killing_ you_all _off. And you_all_will_be being_hated by all the nations, because_of the name of_me.
\v 10 And then many will_be_being_stumbled, and they_will_be_giving_ one_another _over and they_will_be_hating one_another.
\v 11 And many false_prophets will_be_being_raised and will_be_misleading many.
\v 12 And because_of that the lawlessness to_be_multiplied, the love of_the many will_be_being_cooled.
\v 13 But the \add one\add* having_endured to end, this \add one\add* will_be_being_saved.
\v 14 And this the good_message of_the kingdom will_be_being_proclaimed in all the inhabited_world, because/for \add a\add*_testimony to_all the nations, and then the end will_be_coming.
\v 15 Therefore whenever you_all_may_see the abomination of_ the _desolation, which having_been_spoken by Daniaʸl/(Dāniyyēʼl) the prophet, having_stood in \add the\add*_ holy _place (the \add one\add* reading let_be_understanding),
\v 16 then the \add ones\add* in the Youdaia, let_them_be_fleeing to the mountains,
\v 17 the \add one\add* on the housetop, let_ not _come_down to_take_away the \add things\add* out_of the house of_him,
\v 18 and the \add one\add* in the field, let_ not _return back to_take_away the coat of_him.
\v 19 But woe to_the \add women\add* in womb having \add child\add*, and to_the \add women\add* nursing in those the days.
\v 20 But be_praying that the flight of_you_all may_ not _become in_winter, nor on_\add a\add*_day_of_rest.
\v 21 For/Because then will_be great tribulation, such_as has_ not _become from beginning of_\add the\add*_world until the \add time\add* now, nor by_no_means may_ not _become.
\v 22 And except the those days not/lest were_shortened, not any flesh would was_saved, but because_of the chosen, the those days will_be_being_shortened.
\v 23 Then if anyone may_say to_you_all: Behold, here \add is\add* the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, or Here \add he_is\add*, you_all_may_ not _believe \add it\add*.
\v 24 For/Because false_messiahs will_be_being_raised and false_prophets, and they_will_be_giving great signs and wonders, so_as to_mislead even the chosen if possible.
\v 25 Behold, I_have_previously_spoken to_you_all.
\v 26 Therefore if they_may_say to_you_all: Behold, he_is in the wilderness, you_all_may_ not _come_out. Or_see, in the private_rooms, you_all_may_ not _believe \add it\add*.
\v 27 For/Because as the lightning is_coming_out from \add the\add*_east and is_shining as_far_as \add the\add*_west, thus will_be the coming of_the son of_ the _Man.
\v 28 Wherever if the corpse may_be, there the vultures will_be_being_gathered_together.
\v 29 But immediately after the tribulation of_ the those _days: the sun will_be_being_darkened and the moon will_ not _be_giving the radiance of_it: and the stars will_be_falling from the sky, and the powers of_the heavens will_be_being_shaken.
\v 30 And then the sign of_the son of_ the _man will_be_being_seen in \add the\add*_sky, and then all the tribes of_the earth will_be_mourning, and they_will_be_seeing the son of_ the _Man, coming on the clouds of_the sky with power and great glory.
\v 31 And he_will_be_sending_out the messengers of_him with \add a\add*_ great _trumpet cry, and they_will_be_gathering_together the chosen of_him from the four winds, from \add the\add*_extremities of_\add the\add*_heavens to \add the\add*_extremities of_them.
\v 32 And learn the parable of the fig_tree: whenever the branch of_it may_ already _become tender and the leaves may_be_sprouting_out, you_all_are_knowing that the summer \add is\add* near.
\v 33 Thus also you_all whenever you_all_may_see all these \add things\add*, you_all_are_knowing that it_is near at \add the\add*_doors.
\v 34 Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that by_no_means the this generation may_ not _pass_away, until wishfully all these \add things\add* may_become.
\v 35 The heaven and the earth will_be_passing_away, but the \add the\add*_messages of_me by_no_means may_ not _pass_away.
\v 36 But no_one has_known concerning of_ the that _day and hour, not_even the messengers of_the heavens, nor the son, except not/lest only the father.
\v 37 As \add were\add* for the days of_ the _Nōe/(Noaḩ), thus the coming of_the son of_ the _man will_be.
\v 38 For/Because as they_were in the days which before the flood, eating and drinking, marrying and betrothing, until that day Nōe came_in into the box.
\v 39 And they_ not _knew until the flood came and took_ all _away, thus the coming of_the son of_ the _man will_be.
\v 40 Then two will_be in the field, one is_being_taken, and one is_being_left.
\v 41 Two grinding at the grinding_stone, one is_being_taken, and one is_being_left.
\v 42 Therefore be_watching, because you_all_have_ not _known on_what day the \nd master\nd* of_you_all is_coming.
\v 43 But that you_all_are_knowing that if the home_owner had_known in_what watch the thief is_coming, he_ would _watched, and would not allowed the house of_him to_be_dug_through.
\v 44 Because_of this also, you_all be_becoming ready, because you_all_are_ not _supposing the son of_ the _man is_coming in_that. hour.
\v 45 Who consequently is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master appointed over the household of_him, which to_give to_them the food in season?
\v 46 Blessed \add is\add* the that slave, whom the master of_him having_come will_be_finding doing thus.
\v 47 Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that he_will_be_appointing him over all the \add things\add* possessing of_him.
\v 48 But if the that evil slave may_say in the heart of_him: The master of_me is_delaying,
\v 49 and he_may_begin to_be_striking the fellow-slaves of_him, and may_be_eating also may_be_drinking with the \add ones\add* being_drunk,
\v 50 the master of_ the that _slave will_be_coming in \add a\add*_day which he_is_ not _expecting, and in \add an\add*_hour which he_is_ not _knowing,
\v 51 and will_be_dismembering him, and he_will_be_appointing the portion of_him with the hypocrites, there will_be the weeping and the grating of_ the _teeth.
\c 25
\v 1 Then the kingdom of_the heavens will_be_being_likened to_Ten virgins, who having_taken the lamps of_them, came_out in meeting of_the bridegroom.
\v 2 And five of them were foolish, and five \add were\add* prudent.
\v 3 For/Because the foolish having_taken the lamps of_them, they_ not _took olive_oil with themselves, 
\v 4 but the prudent took olive_oil in their containers, with the lamps of_themselves.
\v 5 And the bridegroom delaying, all nodding_off and were_sleeping.
\v 6 But in_\add the\add*_middle of_\add the\add*_night, \add a\add*_clamour has_become: Behold, the bridegroom. Be_coming_out to \add the\add*_meeting.
\v 7 Then all the those virgins were_raised, and they_trimmed the lamps of_themselves.
\v 8 And the foolish said to_the prudent: Give to_us of the olive_oil of_you_all, because the lamps of_us are_being_extinguished.
\v 9 But the prudent answered saying: Lest by_no_means may_ not _suffice for_us and you_all, rather be_going to the \add ones\add* selling, and buy for_yourselves.
\v 10 And them going_away to_buy, the bridegroom came, and the ready \add ones\add* came_in with him to the wedding_festivities, and the door was_shut.
\v 11 And later the other virgins are_ also _coming saying: Master, master, open_up to_us. 
\v 12 But he answering said: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, I_have_ not _known you_all.
\v 13 Therefore be_watching, because you_all_have_ neither _known the day nor the hour.
\v 14 For/Because as \add a\add*_man travelling called his own slaves and gave_over the \add things\add* possessing of_him to_them.
\v 15 And on_one_hand he_gave five talantons\add _of_silver\add* to_one, on_the_other_hand two to_one, on_the_other_hand one to_one, to_each according_to his own ability, and he_travelled immediately.
\v 16 Having_been_gone, the \add one\add* having_received the five talantons\add _of_silver\add* worked with them and gained other five talantons\add _of_silver\add*.
\v 17 Likewise also the \add one\add* with_the two gained another two.
\v 18 But the \add one\add* having_received the one, having_gone_away, dug \add the\add*_ground and hid the silver of_the master of_him.
\v 19 And after much time, the master of_ the those _slaves is_coming, and he_is_settling_accounts \add the\add*_account with them.
\v 20 And having_approached the \add one\add* having_received the five talantons\add _of_silver\add*, brought \add the\add*_other five talantons\add _of_silver\add* saying, Five talantons\add _of_silver\add*, master, you_gave_over to_me, see, I_gained. another five talantons\add _of_silver\add*.
\v 21 The master of_him was_saying to_him: Well \add done\add*, good and faithful slave. You_were faithful over \add a\add*_few \add things\add*, I_will_be_appointing you over many \add things\add*, come_in into the joy of_the master of_you.
\v 22 The \add one\add* with_the two talantons\add _of_silver\add* having_ also _approached said: Master, you_gave_over two talantons\add _of_silver\add* to_me. Behold, I_gained another two talantons\add _of_silver\add*.
\v 23 The master of_him was_saying to_him: Well \add done\add*, good and faithful slave. You_were faithful over \add a\add*_few \add things\add*, I_will_be_appointing you over many \add things\add*, come_in into the joy of_the master of_you.
\v 24 And the \add one\add* having_received with_the one talanton\add _of_silver\add*, having_ also _approached said: Master, I_knew you, that you_are \add a\add*_hard, man, reaping where you_ not _sowed, and gathering_together whence you_ not _scattered.
\v 25 And having_been_afraid having_gone_away, I_hid the talanton\add _of_silver\add* of_you in the ground. Behold, you_are_having the your \add own\add*.
\v 26 But the master of_him, answering said to_him: Evil and reluctant slave. You_had_known that I_am_reaping where I_ not _sowed, and I_am_gathering_together whence I_ not _scattered.
\v 27 Therefore it_was_fitting you to_put the silver_coins of_me to_the bankers, and having_come, I would received_back the mine with interest.
\v 28 Therefore take_ the talanton\add _of_silver\add* _away from him, and give \add it\add* to_the \add one\add* having the ten talantons\add _of_silver\add*.
\v 29 For/Because to_everyone which having will_be_being_given and will_be_being_in_abundance, but the \add one\add* not having, even what he_is_having will_be_being_taken_away from him.
\v 30 And throw_out the useless slave into the the outer darkness. There will_be the weeping and the grating of_ the _teeth.
\v 31 But whenever the son of_ the _man may_come in the glory of_him, and all the messengers with him, then he_will_be_sitting_down on throne of_glory of_him.
\v 32 And all the nations will_be_being_gathered_together before him, and will_be_setting_apart them from one_another, as the shepherd is_setting_apart the sheep from the goats.
\v 33 And the sheep will_be_standing on_one_hand on \add the\add*_right of_him, on_the_other_hand the goats on \add the\add*_left.
\v 34 Then the king will_be_saying to_the \add ones\add* on \add the\add*_right of_him: Come you_all having_been_blessed of_the father of_me, inherit the kingdom having_been_prepared for_you_all from \add the\add*_foundation of_\add the\add*_world.
\v 35 For/Because I_hungered and you_all_gave to_me to_eat, I_thirsted and you_all_gave_ me _to_drink, I_was \add a\add*_stranger and you_all_brought_ me _in,
\v 36 naked and you_all_clothed me, I_ailed and you_all_visited me, I_was in prison and you_came to me.
\v 37 Then the righteous will_be_answering to_him saying: \nd master\nd*, when we_saw you hungering and we_fed, or thirsting and we_gave_to_drink?
\v 38 And when we_saw you \add a\add*_stranger and we_brought_in, or naked and we_clothed?
\v 39 And when we_saw you sick or in prison, and we_came to you?
\v 40 And the king answering, will_be_saying to_them: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, because/for as_much_as you_all_did \add it\add* to_ the least _one of_these the brothers of_me, you_all_did \add it\add* to_me.
\v 41 Then he will_ also _be_saying to_the \add ones\add* on \add the\add*_left: Be_going from me having_been_cursed \add ones\add* into the the eternal fire, which having_been_prepared for_the devil and the messengers of_him.
\v 42 For/Because I_hungered and you_all_ not _gave to_me to_eat, and I_thirsted and not you_all_gave_ me _to_drink,
\v 43 I_was \add a\add*_stranger and you_all_ not _brought_in me, naked and you_all_ not _clothed me, sick and in prison and you_all_ not _visited me.
\v 44 Then they will_ also _be_answering saying: \nd master\nd*, when we_saw you hungering, or thirsting, or \add a\add*_stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and we_ not _served unto_you?
\v 45 Then he_will_be_answering to_them saying: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, because/for as_much_as you_all_ not _did \add it\add* to_ of_these the _one least, neither you_all_did \add it\add* to_me.
\v 46 And these will_be_going_away into eternal punishment, but the \add the\add*_righteous into eternal life.
\c 26
\v 1 And it_became when the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* finished all the these messages, he_said to_the apprentices/followers of_him,
\v 2 You_all_have_known that after two days the passover_\add feast\add* is_becoming, and the son of_ the _man is_being_given_over in_order that to_be_executed_on_a_stake.
\v 3 Then the chief_priests and the elders of_the people were_gathered_together in the courtyard of_the chief_priest, who being_called Kaiafas,
\v 4 and they_plotted_together that they_may_apprehend the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* by_deceit and they_may_kill_ \add him\add* _off.
\v 5 But they_were_saying: Not at the feast, in_order_that \add a\add*_commotion may_ not _become among the people.
\v 6 And the of_\nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_become in Baʸthania in house of_Simōn the leprous,
\v 7 \add a\add*_woman having \add an\add*_alabaster_flask of_ heavily_valued _ointment approached to_him, and she_poured_down \add it\add* on the head of_him reclining.
\v 8 But the apprentices/followers having_seen, resented saying: For/Because why the this destruction?
\v 9 For/Because this was_able to_be_sold for_much and to_be_given to_\add the\add*_poor.
\v 10 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_known, said to_them: Why are_you_all_bringing_about troubles to_the women? For/Because she_did \add a\add*_ beautiful _work to me.
\v 11 For/Because you_all_are_ always _having the poor with yourselves, but you_all_are_ not always _having me.
\v 12 For/Because this \add woman\add*, having_put the on_ this _ointment on the body of_me, because/for did \add it\add* that to_bury me.
\v 13 Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, wherever the this good_message if may_be_proclaimed in all the world, will_ also _be_being_spoken what this \add woman\add* did for \add a\add*_memorial of_her.
\v 14 Then one of_the twelve who being_called Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) Iskariōtaʸs, having_been_gone to the chief_priests
\v 15 he_said: What are_you_all_willing to_give to_me, and_I will_be_giving_ him _over to_you_all? And they they_set to_him thirty silver_coins.
\v 16 And from then he_was_seeking \add an\add*_opportunity, in_order_that he_may_give_ him _over.
\v 17 And on_the first \add day\add* of_ the _non-fermented \add bread\add*, the apprentices/followers approached to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* saying: Where are_you_wanting \add that\add* we_may_prepare for_you to_eat the passover_\add feast\add*?
\v 18 And he said: Be_going into the city to the someone and say to_him: The teacher is_saying: The time of_me is near, I_am_making the passover_\add feast\add* with you with the apprentices/followers of_me.
\v 19 And the apprentices/followers did as the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* directed to_them, and they_prepared the passover_\add feast\add*.
\v 20 And having_become evening, he_was_reclining with the twelve,
\v 21 and to_them eating he_said: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that one of you_all will_be_giving_ me _over.
\v 22 And being_ exceedingly _sorrowed, each one of_them they_began to_be_saying to_him: Surely_not I am, \nd master\nd*?
\v 23 And he answering said: The \add one\add* having_dipped_in his hand with me in the bowl, this \add one\add* will_be_giving_ me _over.
\v 24 On_one_hand the son of_ the _man is_going as it_has_been_written about him, on_the_other_hand woe to_the that man by whom the son of_ the _man is_being_given_over. It_was better for_him, if the that man was_ not _born.
\v 25 And Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) who giving_ him _over, answering said: Surely_not I am, my_great_\add one\add*? He_is_saying to_him: You said \add it\add*.
\v 26 And of_them eating, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_taken bread and having_blessed, he_broke \add it\add* and having_given to_the apprentices/followers said: Take, eat, this is the body of_me.
\v 27 And having_taken \add a\add*_cup and having_given_thanks, he_gave \add it\add* to_them saying: All drink of it,
\v 28 for/because this is the blood of_me of_the covenant, the \add blood\add* for/because many being_poured_out for/because forgiveness of_sins.
\v 29 But I_am_saying to_you_all, by_no_means I_may_ not _drink of this the fruit of_the vine from now until the that day, whenever I_may_be_drinking it with you_all new in the kingdom of_the father of_me.
\v 30 And having_sung_hymns, they_came_out to the Mount of_ the _Olives.
\v 31 Then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: All of_you_all will_be_being_stumbled in me at the this night, because/for it_has_been_written: I_will_be_striking the shepherd, and the sheep of_the flock will_be_being_scattered.
\v 32 But after which me to_be_raised, will_be_going_before you_all into the Galilaia/(Gālīl).
\v 33 But the Petros answering said to_him: If all will_be_being_stumbled in you, I never will_be_being_stumbled.
\v 34 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_saying to_him: Truly, I_am_saying to_you that at this the night before \add the\add*_rooster to_crow, three-times you_will_be_renouncing me.
\v 35 The Petros is_saying to_him: Even_if it_may_be_fitting me to_die_off with you, by_no_means I will_ not _be_renouncing you. All the apprentices/followers also said likewise.
\v 36 Then the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_coming with them to \add a\add*_property being_called Gethsaʸmanaʸ, and he_is_saying to_the apprentices/followers: Sit_down here until of_which having_gone_away there, I_may_pray.
\v 37 And having_taken the Petros and the two sons of_Zebedaios, he_began to_be_being_sorrowed and to_be_distressing.
\v 38 Then he_is_saying to_them: The soul of_me is very_sorrowful to death, remain here and be_watching with me.
\v 39 And having_approached \add a\add*_little, he_fell on \add the\add*_face of_him, praying and saying: father of_me, if it_is possible, let_ the this cup _pass_by from me. However not as I am_wanting, but as you.
\v 40 And he_is_coming to the apprentices/followers and is_finding them sleeping, and he_is_saying to_ the _Petros: Thus you_all_were_ not _able to_watch one hour with me?
\v 41 Be_watching and be_praying, in_order_that you_all_may_ not _come_in into temptation. On_one_hand the spirit \add is\add* eager, on_the_other_hand the \add the\add*_flesh \add is\add* weak.
\v 42 Again having_gone_away for \add a\add*_second, he_prayed saying: father of_me, if this is_ not _able to_pass_by, if I_may_ not _drink it, let_ the will of_you _be_become.
\v 43 And having_come again, he_found them sleeping, because/for the eyes of_them were having_been_weighed_down.
\v 44 And having_left them again, having_gone_away, he_prayed for \add the\add*_third \add time\add* having_said the same statement again.
\v 45 Then he_is_coming to the apprentices/followers and is_saying to_them: You_all_are_sleeping for_the rest and you_all_are_resting? Behold, the hour has_neared, and the son of_ the _man is_being_given_over into \add the\add*_hands of_sinners.
\v 46 Be_being_raised, we_may_be_going. Behold, the \add one\add* giving_ me _over has_neared. 
\v 47 And of_him still speaking, see Youdas/(Yəhūdāh), one of_the twelve came, and with him \add a\add*_ great _crowd with swords and clubs from the chief_priests and elders of_the people.
\v 48 And the \add one\add* giving_over him, gave to_them \add a\add*_sign saying: Whomever wishfully I_may_kiss, it_is he, apprehend him.
\v 49 And immediately having_approached to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* he_said: Greetings, my_great_\add one\add*, and he_kissed him.
\v 50 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_him: Friend, because/for what are_you_coming? Then having_approached, they_laid_on their hands on the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, and they_apprehended him.
\v 51 And see, one of_the \add ones\add* with \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, having_stretched_out his hand, drew_out the sword of_him, and having_struck the slave of_the chief_priest, cut_off the ear of_him.
\v 52 Then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him: Turn_away the sword of_you into the place of_it, because/for all the \add ones\add* having_taken \add the\add*_sword, will_be_perishing by \add the\add*_sword.
\v 53 Or are_you_supposing that I_am_ not _being_able now to_appeal the father of_me, and he_will_be_standing_ more twelve of_legions of_messengers _before before_me?
\v 54 Therefore how may_ The scriptures _be_fulfilled, that thus it_is_fitting to_become?
\v 55 In that the hour, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_the crowds: You_all_came_out with swords and clubs to_capture me as against \add a\add*_robber? In_every day in the temple, I_was_sitting teaching, and you_all_ not _apprehended me.
\v 56 But this all has_become, in_order_that the \add things\add* scriptures of_the prophets may_be_fulfilled. Then all the apprentices/followers, having_left him fled.
\v 57 And the \add ones\add* having_apprehended the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, led_ \add him\add* _away to Kaiafas the chief_priest, where the scribes and the elders were_gathered_together.
\v 58 But the Petros was_following after_him from afar to the courtyard of_the chief_priest, and having_come_in inside, he_was_sitting with the attendants to_see the outcome.
\v 59 And the chief_priests and the whole council were_seeking false_witness against the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* so_that they_may_put_ him _to_death,
\v 60 but of_many false_witnesses having_approached, they_ not _found. But later, two having_approached
\v 61 said: This \add man\add* was_saying: I_am_being_able to_tear_down the temple of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and to_build \add it\add* it by of_three days.
\v 62 And the chief_priest having_stood_up, said to_him: Are_you_answering nothing, what these \add men\add* are_testifying against_you?
\v 63 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_keeping_silent. And the chief_priest said to_him: I_am_adjuring you by the which living \nd god\nd* that you_may_tell to_us if you are the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, the son of_the \nd god\nd*.
\v 64 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him: You said \add it\add*. However I_am_saying to_you_all, from now you_all_will_be_seeing the son of_ the _Man: sitting on \add the\add*_right of_ the _power, and coming in the clouds of_the sky.
\v 65 Then the chief_priest tore the robes of_him saying: He_slandered, why are_we_having anymore need of_witnesses? Behold, now you_all_heard the slander.
\v 66 What is_it_supposing to_you_all? And which answering they_said: He_is liable of_death.
\v 67 Then they_spat in the face of_him, and they_beat him and they slapped \add him\add*
\v 68 saying: Prophesy to_us, \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, who is the \add one\add* having_struck you?
\v 69 And the Petros was_sitting outside in the courtyard, and one servant_girl approached to_him saying: You also were_were with \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* the Galilaios.
\v 70 But he disowned \add him\add* before all saying: I_have_ not _known what you_are_saying.
\v 71 And having_come_out to the gate, another saw him and she_is_saying to_the \add ones\add* there: This \add man\add* was with \nd Yaʸsous\nd* the from_Nazaret.
\v 72 And again he_disowned with \add an\add*_oath, that I_have_ not _known the man.
\v 73 And after \add a\add*_little, the \add ones\add* having_stood having_approached said to_ the _Petros: Truly also you are of them, because/for even the speech of_you is_making you evident.
\v 74 Then he_began to_be_cursing and to_be_swearing, that I_have_ not _known the man. And immediately \add a\add*_rooster crowed.
\v 75 And the Petros was_reminded of_the message of_\nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_said, that Before \add the\add*_rooster to_crow, you_will_be_renouncing me three-times. And having_come_out out, he_wept bitterly.
\c 27
\v 1 And having_become in_the_morning, all the chief_priests and the elders of_the people took counsel against the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, so_that to_put_ him _to_death, 
\v 2 and having_bound him, they_led_away and gave_ \add him\add* _over to_Pilatos the governor.
\v 3 Then Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) the \add one\add* giving_ him _over, having_seen that he_was_condemned, having_been_regretful, he_returned the thirty silver_coins to_the chief_priests and elders
\v 4 saying: I_sinned having_given_over innocent blood. But they said: What \add is_it\add* to us? You will_be_seeing \add to_it\add*.
\v 5 And having_thrown_down the silver_coins into the temple, he_withdrew and having_gone_away hanged \add himself\add*.
\v 6 And the chief_priests having_taken the silver_coins said: It_is_ not _permitting to_put them into the temple_treasury, because it_is \add the\add*_price of_blood.
\v 7 And having_taken counsel, they_bought the field of_the potter with them, because/for \add a\add*_burial_place for_the strangers.
\v 8 Therefore the that field was_called \add the\add*_field of_blood to the \add day\add* today.
\v 9 Then the \add message\add* having_been_spoken by Yeremias/(Yirəmə\sup yāh\sup*) the prophet was_fulfilled saying: And they_took the thirty silver_coins, the price of_the \add one\add* having_been_priced, whom they_priced by \add the\add*_sons of_Israaʸl/(Yisərā\sup ʼēl\sup*),
\v 10 and they_gave them for the field of_the potter, as \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* directed to_me.
\v 11 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* was_stood before the governor, and the governor asked him saying: Are you the king of_the Youdaiōns? And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_saying to_him: You are_saying \add it\add*.
\v 12 And in that to_ him _be_being_accused by the chief_priests and the elders, he_answered nothing.
\v 13 Then the Pilatos is_saying to_him: You_are_ not _hearing how_many \add things\add* against_you they_are_testifying?
\v 14 And he_ not _answered to_him, to not_even one message, so_as to_be_marvelling the governor exceedingly.
\v 15 And concerning \add the\add*_feast, the governor had_been_accustomed to_be_sending_away one prisoner to_the crowd, whom they_were_wanting.
\v 16 And they_were_having then \add the\add*_ notable _prisoner being_called Barabbas.
\v 17 Therefore of_them having_been_gathered_together, the Pilatos said to_them: Whom are_you_all_willing I_may_send_away to_you_all, Barabbas or \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, who \add is\add* being_called \add the\add*_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*?
\v 18 For/Because he_had_known that they_gave_ him _over because_of envy.
\v 19 But him sitting on the tribunal, the wife of_him sent_out to him saying: \add Let_be\add* nothing to_you and the that righteous \add man\add*, because/for I_suffered many \add things\add* today in \add a\add*_dream because_of him.
\v 20 But the chief_priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they_may_request the Barabbas and they_may_destroy the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 21 And the governor answering said to_them: Which are_you_all_wanting of the two, I_may_send_away to_you_all? And they said, the Barabbas.
\v 22 The Pilatos is_saying to_them: Therefore what may_I_do to_\nd Yaʸsous\nd*, who \add is\add* being_called \add the\add*_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*? All are_saying: Let_him_be_executed_on_a_stake.
\v 23 And he was_saying: For/Because what evil he_did? And they were_ exceedingly _crying_out saying: Let_him_be_executed_on_a_stake.
\v 24 And the Pilatos having_seen that it_is_benefiting nothing, but rather is_becoming \add a\add*_commotion, having_taken water, he_washed_off his hands in_front_of the crowd saying: I_am innocent of the blood the this righteous \add one\add*, . you_all will_be_seeing \add to_it\add*.
\v 25 And all the people answering said: The blood of_him \add is\add* on us and on the children of_us.
\v 26 Then he_sent_ The Barabbas _away to_them, but having_flogged the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, he_gave_ \add him\add* _over, in_order_that he_may_be_executed_on_a_stake.
\v 27 Then the soldiers of_the governor, having_taken the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* to the residence_of_the_governor, gathered_together all the cohort before him.
\v 28 And having_stripped_ him _off, they_put_around \add a\add*_ scarlet _robe to_him,
\v 29 and having_twisted_together \add a\add*_crown of thorns, they_put_on \add it\add* on the head of_him, and \add a\add*_staff in the right \add hand\add* of_him, and having_kneeled before him, they_mocked at_him saying: Greetings, the king of_the Youdaiōns. 
\v 30 And having_spat on him, they_took the reed and they_were_striking \add him\add* on the head of_him.
\v 31 And when they_mocked at_him, they_stripped_ the robe _off him and they_dressed_ him _in the clothes of_him, and they_led_ him _away into the \add place\add* to_execute_on_a_stake \add him\add*.
\v 32 And coming_out, they_found \add a\add*_ \add a\add*_from_Kuraʸnaʸ _man, by_\add the\add*_name Simōn. This \add one\add* they_compelled that he_may_carry the stake of_him.
\v 33 And having_come to \add a\add*_place being_called Golgotha/(Guləggolet), which is being_called place Of_\add the\add*_skull,
\v 34 they_gave wine having_been_mixed with gall to_him to_drink, and having_tasted \add it\add*, he_ not _willed to_drink \add it\add*.
\v 35 And having_executed_on_a_stake him, they_divided the clothes of_him, throwing \add a\add*_lot,
\v 36 and sitting they_were_guarding him there.
\v 37 And they_put_on over the head of_him the charge of_him having_been_written: This is \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, the king of_the Youdaiōns.
\v 38 Then two robbers are_being_executed_on_a_stake with him, one on \add the\add*_right, and one on \add the\add*_left.
\v 39 And the \add ones\add* passing_through were_slandering him, shaking the heads of_them
\v 40 and saying: You tearing_down the temple and building \add it\add* in three days, save yourself. If you_are \add the\add*_son, of_ the _\nd god\nd*, come_down from the stake. 
\v 41 Likewise the chief_priests with the scribes and elders mocking were_saying,
\v 42 He_saved others, he_is_ not _able to_save himself. He_Is king of_Israaʸl/(Yisərā\sup ʼēl\sup*), let_him_come_down now from the stake, and we_will_be_believing in him.
\v 43 He_has_trusted in the \nd god\nd*, let_him_rescue now if he_is_wanting him. For/Because he_said, that I_am \add the\add*_son of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 44 And the same also the robbers, the \add ones\add* having_been_executed_on_a_stake_with with him, were_deriding him.
\v 45 And from \add the\add*_sixth hour, darkness became over all the land until \add the\add*_ ninth _hour.
\v 46 And about the ninth hour, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* shouted with_\add a\add*_ loud _voice saying: Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? This is: \nd god\nd* of_me, \nd god\nd* of_me, because/for_ why _reason you_abandoned me?
\v 47 And some of_the \add ones\add* having_stood there having_heard were_saying, that This \add man\add* is_calling Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*).
\v 48 And immediately one of them having_run and having_taken \add a\add*_sponge, and having_filled \add it\add* with_wine_vinegar and having_put_around \add it\add* around_\add a\add*_reed, was_giving_ him _to_drink.
\v 49 But the rest were_saying: Leave \add it\add*, we_may_see whether Aʸlias is_coming, going_to_save him.
\v 50 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* again having_cried_out with_\add a\add*_ loud _voice, sent_away his spirit.
\v 51 And see, the curtain of_the temple was_torn into two from top to bottom, and the earth was_shaken and the rocks were_divided,
\v 52 and the tombs were_opened_up and many bodies of_the holy \add ones\add* having_been_fallen_asleep was_raised, 
\v 53 and having_come_out out_of the tombs after the resurrection of_him, they_came_in into the holy city and were_manifested to_many.
\v 54 And the centurion and the \add ones\add* with him guarding the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, having_seen the earthquake and the \add things\add* having_become, were_ exceedingly _afraid saying: Truly this \add one\add* was son of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 55 And there were many women observing from afar, who followed the after_\nd Yaʸsous\nd* from the Galilaia/(Gālīl) serving unto_him,
\v 56 among whom was Maria/(Mirəyām) the from_Magdala, and Maria the mother of_ the _Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ) and of_Yōsaʸs/(Yōşēf?), and the mother of_the sons of_Zebedaios.
\v 57 And having_become evening, \add a\add*_ rich _man from Arimathaia came, namely Yōsaʸf/(Yōşēf), who also himself trained to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 58 This \add one\add* having_approached to_ the _Pilatos, requested the body of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd*. Then the Pilatos commanded \add it\add* to_be_given_back.
\v 59 And having_taken the body, the Yōsaʸf wrapped it in_\add a\add*_ clean _linen_cloth,
\v 60 and put it in the new tomb of_him which he_hewn in the rock, and having_rolled \add a\add*_ great _stone to_the door of_the tomb, he_went_away.
\v 61 And Maria the from_Magdala was there and the other Maria, sitting in_front_of the tomb.
\v 62 And on_the \add day\add* of_next, which is after the preparation \add day\add*, the chief_priests and the Farisaios_\add party\add* were_gathered_together to Pilatos
\v 63 saying: Master, we_were_reminded that that the deceiver still living said: I_am_being_raised after three days.
\v 64 Therefore command the tomb to_be_secured until the third day, lest the apprentices/followers having_come may_steal him and they_may_say to_the people: He_was_raised from the dead, and the last deception will_be worse \add than\add* the first.
\v 65 And the Pilatos was_saying to_them: You_all_are_having \add a\add*_guard, be_going secure \add it\add* as you_all_have_known.
\v 66 And they having_been_gone, secured the tomb, having_sealed the stone with the guard.
\c 28
\v 1 And after \add the\add*_days_of_rest, at_the \add time\add* dawning toward \add the\add*_first \add day\add* of_\add the\add*_week, Maria/(Mirəyām) the from_Magdala and the other Maria came, to_observe the tomb.
\v 2 And see, \add an\add*_ great _earthquake became, because/for \add an\add*_messenger of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* having_come_down from heaven and having_approached, rolled_away the stone and was_sitting on it.
\v 3 And the appearance of_him was as lightning, and the clothing of_him white as snow.
\v 4 And the \add ones\add* guarding were_shaken from the fear of_him, and were_become as dead \add men\add*.
\v 5 And the messenger answering said to_the women: Be_ not _fearing you_all, because/for I_have_known that you_all_are_seeking \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, the \add one\add* having_been_executed_on_a_stake.
\v 6 He_is not here, because/for he_was_raised as he_said. Come see the place where he_was_lying.
\v 7 And having_been_gone quickly, say to_the apprentices/followers of_him that he_was_raised from the dead, and see, he_is_going_before you_all into the Galilaia/(Gālīl), you_all_will_be_seeing him there. Behold, I_told to_you_all.
\v 8 And having_gone_away quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy, they_ran to_report to_the apprentices/followers of_him.
\v 9 And see, \nd Yaʸsous\nd* met with_them saying: Greetings. And the \add women\add* having_approached, took_hold_of the feet of_him and they_prostrated before_him.
\v 10 Then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: Be_ not _fearing. Be_going, report to_the brothers of_me that they_may_go_away into the Galilaia, and they_will_be_seeing me there.
\v 11 And them going, see, some of_the guard having_come into the city, reported to_the chief_priests all the \add things\add* having_become.
\v 12 And having_been_gathered_together with the elders, and having_taken counsel, they_gave many silver_coins to_the soldiers
\v 13 saying: Say that: The apprentices/followers of_him having_come by_night, stole him of_us falling_asleep.
\v 14 And if this may_be_heard by the governor, we will_be_persuading \add him\add* and we_will_be_making you_all unanxious.
\v 15 And having_taken \add the\add*_silver_coins, they did as they_were_taught. And the this message was_spread_abroad among \add the\add*_Youdaiōns until the today.
\v 16 But the \add the\add*_eleven apprentices/followers were_gone into the Galilaia/(Gālīl), to the mountain where the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* determined for_them.
\v 17 And having_seen him, they_prostrated, but they doubted.
\v 18 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_approached, spoke to_them saying: All authority in heaven and on earth was_given to_me.
\v 19 Therefore having_been_gone, train_followers all the nations, immersing them in the name of_the father, and of_the son, and of_the holy \nd spirit\nd*,
\v 20 teaching them to_be_keeping all \add things\add* as_much_as I_commanded to_you_all. And see, I am with you_all all the days, until the completion of_the age.
