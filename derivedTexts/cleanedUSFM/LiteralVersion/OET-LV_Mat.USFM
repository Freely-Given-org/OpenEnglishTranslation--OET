\v 1 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_been_born in Baʸthleʼem/(Bēyt-leḩem) of_ the _Youdaia in \add the\add*_days of_Haʸrōdaʸs the king, see, wise_men from east arrived in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim)
\v 2 saying: Where is the \add one\add*, having_been_born king of_the Youdaiōns? For/Because we_saw the star of_him in the east and we_came to_prostrate before_him.
\v 3 And the king Haʸrōdaʸs having_heard was_disturbed, and all Hierousalaʸm with him.
\v 4 And having_gathered_together all the chief_priests and scribes of_the people, he_was_inquiring from them where the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* is_being_born.
\v 5 And they said to_him: In Baʸthleʼem of_ the _Youdaia, because/for thus it_has_been_written through the prophet:
\v 6 And you Baʸthleʼem, land of_Youda/(Yəhūdāh), are by_no_means least among the rulers of_Youda, because/for out_of of_you will_be_coming_out \add a\add*_leading \add one\add*, who will_be_shepherding the people of_me, the Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*).
\v 7 Then Haʸrōdaʸs having_ secretly _called the wise_men, ascertained from them the time of_the appearing star.
\v 8 And having_sent them to Baʸthleʼem he_said: Having_been_gone, search_out exactly for the little_child, and when you_all_may_find \add him\add*, report to_me so_that also_I, having_come, may_prostrate before_him.
\v 9 And which having_heard from_the king, they_were_gone, and see, the star, which they_saw in the east, was_going_before them until having_come, it_was_stood over where the little_child was.
\v 10 And having_seen the star, they_were_ exceedingly _elated with_ great _joy.
\v 11 And having_come into the house, they_saw the little_child with Maria/(Miryām) the mother of_him, and having_fallen, they_prostrated before_him, and having_opened_up the treasures of_them, they_offered gifts to_him: gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
\v 12 And having_been_warned in \add a\add*_dream not to_return to Haʸrōdaʸs, they_withdrew by another way into the country of_them.
\v 13 And having_withdrawn from_them, see, \add an\add*_messenger of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* is_appearing in \add a\add*_dream to_ the _Yōsaʸf/(Yōşēf) saying: Having_been_raised, take the little_child and the mother of_him, and be_fleeing into Aiguptos/(Miʦrayim), and be there until wishfully I_may_tell to_you, because/for Haʸrōdaʸs is_going to_be_seeking the little_child which to_destroy him.
\v 14 And which having_been_raised, he_took the little_child and the mother of_him by_night and withdrew into Aiguptos,
\v 15 and he_was there until the death of_Haʸrōdaʸs, in_order_that the \add message\add* may_be_fulfilled having_been_spoken by \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* through the prophet saying: I_called the son of_me out_of of_Aiguptos.
\v 16 Then Haʸrōdaʸs, having_seen that he_was_mocked by the wise_men, was_enraged exceedingly and having_sent_out, he_killed all the boys which in Baʸthleʼem/(Bēyt-leḩem) and in all the regions of_it from two_year and lower, according_to the time which he_ascertained from the wise_men.
\v 17 Then the \add message\add* was_fulfilled having_been_spoken through Yeremias/(Yirmə\sup yāh\sup*) the prophet saying,
\v 18 \add A\add*_voice in Ɽama/(Rāmāh) was_heard, weeping and great mourning, Ɽaⱪaʸl/(Rāḩēl) weeping for_the children of_her, and was_ not _wanting to_be_comforted, because they_are not.
\v 19 But the Haʸrōdaʸs having_died, see, \add an\add*_messenger of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* is_appearing in \add a\add*_dream to_ the _Yōsaʸf in Aiguptos
\v 20 saying: Having_been_raised, take the little_child and the mother of_him, and be_going into \add the\add*_land of_Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*), because/for the \add ones\add* seeking the life of_the little_child have_died.
\v 21 And he having_been_raised, took the little_child and the mother of_him, and came_in into \add the\add*_land of_Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*).
\v 22 But having_heard that Arⱪelaos is_reigning the over_Youdaia instead_of Haʸrōdaʸs the father of_him, he_was_afraid to_go_away there, and having_been_warned in \add a\add*_dream, he_withdrew into the districts of_ the _Galilaia/(Gālīl),
\v 23 and having_come, he_dwelt into \add a\add*_city being_called Nazaret, so_that the \add message\add* may_be_fulfilled having_been_spoken through the prophets, he_will_be_being_called that \add A\add*_from_Nazaret.

\v 1 And in the those days Yōannaʸs the immerser is_arriving, proclaiming in the wilderness of_ the _Youdaia
\v 2 saying: Be_repenting, because/for the kingdom of_the heavens has_neared.
\v 3 For/Because this is the \add one\add* having_been_spoken through Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊ\sup yāh\sup*) the prophet saying: \add The\add*_voice of_\add a\add*_shouting \add one\add* in the wilderness prepare the way of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, be_making the paths of_him straight.
\v 4 And the Yōannaʸs himself was_having the clothing of_him from hairs of_\add a\add*_camel and \add a\add*_ leather _belt around the waist of_him, and the food of_him was locusts and wild honey.
\v 5 Then Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and all the Youdaia, and all the surrounding_region of_the Yordanaʸs/(Yardēn) was_going_out to him,
\v 6 and they_were_being_immersed by him in the Yordanaʸs River, confessing the sins of_them.
\v 7 But having_seen many of_the Farisaios_\add party\add* and Saddoukaios_\add sect\add* coming to the immersion of_him, he_said to_them: Brood of_vipers, who warned to_you_all to_flee from the coming severe_anger?
\v 8 Therefore produce fruit worthy of_ the _repentance.
\v 9 And you_all_may_ not _suppose to_be_saying among yourselves, we_are_having the Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām) father, because/for I_am_saying to_you_all that the \nd god\nd* is_able to_raise children to_ the _Abraʼam out_of the these stones.
\v 10 And already the axe is_lying to the root of_the trees, therefore every tree not producing good fruit is_being_cut_off and is_being_thrown into \add the\add*_fire.
\v 11 I on_one_hand am_immersing you_all in water to repentance, on_the_other_hand the \add one\add* coming after me is mightier \add than\add* me, of_whom not I_am worthy to_bear the sandals. He will_be_immersing you_all in \add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd* and with_fire.
\v 12 Of_whom the winnowing_fork \add is\add* in the hand of_him, and he_will_be_clearing_out the threshing_floor of_him, and will_be_gathering_together the wheat of_him into the barn, but the chaff he_will_be_burning_up with_ inextinguishable _fire.
\v 13 Then the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_arriving from the Galilaia/(Gālīl) to the Yordanaʸs/(Yardēn) to the Yōannaʸs, which to_be_immersed by him.
\v 14 But the was_forbidding him saying: I am_having need to_be_immersed by you, and you are_coming to me?
\v 15 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering said to him: Allow \add it\add* now, because/for thus it_is befitting to_us to_fulfill all righteousness. Then he_is_allowing him.
\v 16 And having_been_immersed, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* immediately went_up from the water, and see, the heavens were_opened_up, and he_saw the \nd spirit\nd* of_ the _\nd god\nd* coming_down as_if \add a\add*_dove and coming on him.
\v 17 And see, \add a\add*_voice out_of of_the heavens saying: This is the son of_me, the beloved in whom I_took_pleasure.

\v 1 Then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_brought_up into the wilderness by the \nd spirit\nd* to_be_tempted by the devil.
\v 2 And having_fasted forty days and forty nights, later he_hungered.
\v 3 And the \add one\add* tempting having_approached, said to_him: If you_are \add the\add*_son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, speak that the these stones may_become loaves.
\v 4 But he answering said: It_has_been_written: The person not only by bread will_be_living, but by every message going_out through \add the\add*_mouth of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 5 Then the devil is_taking him to the holy city, and stood him on the pinnacle of_the temple,
\v 6 and he_is_saying to_him: If you_are \add the\add*_son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, throw yourself down, because/for it_has_been_written, that Will_be_commanding to_the messengers of_him concerning you, and: They_will_be_carrying you in \add their\add*_hands, lest you_may_strike the foot of_you against \add a\add*_stone.
\v 7 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* was_saying to_him: Again it_has_been_written: You_˓will˒_ not _be_Testing \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* the \nd god\nd* of_you.
\v 8 Again the devil is_taking him to \add a\add*_ exceedingly high _mountain, and is_showing to_him all the kingdoms of_the world and the glory of_them,
\v 9 and he_said to_him: I_will_be_giving all these \add things\add* to_you if having_fallen, you_may_prostrate before_me.
\v 10 Then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him: Be_going_away Satan/(Sāţān), because/for it_has_been_written: You_will_be_prostrating \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* the \nd god\nd* of_you, and only unto_him you_will_be_serving.
\v 11 Then the devil is_leaving him, and see, messengers approached and were_serving unto_him.
\v 12 And having_heard that Yōannaʸs was_given_over, he_withdrew into the Galilaia/(Gālīl).
\v 13 And having_left the Nazaret, having_come he_dwelt at Kafarnaʼoum, which \add is\add* by_\add the\add*_seaside in \add the\add*_regions of_Zaboulōn/(Zəⱱūlūn) and Nefthaleim/(Naftālī), 
\v 14 in_order_that the \add message\add* may_be_fulfilled having_been_spoken by Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊ\sup yāh\sup*) the prophet saying,
\v 15 Land of_Zaboulōn and land of_Nefthaleim, way of_\add the\add*_sea, beyond the Yordanaʸs/(Yardēn), Galilaia of_the pagans.
\v 16 The people which sitting in darkness saw \add a\add*_ great _light, and to_the \add ones\add* sitting in \add a\add*_land and shadow of_death, \add a\add*_light rose on_them.
\v 17 From then the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* began to_be_proclaiming and to_be_saying: Be_repenting, because/for the kingdom of_the heavens has_neared.
\v 18 And walking beside the sea of_ the _Galilaia he_saw two, brothers, Simōn which being_called Petros and Andreas the brother of_him, throwing \add a\add*_throwing_net into the sea, because/for they_were fishermen.
\v 19 And he_is_saying to_them: Come after me, and I_will_be_making you_all fishermen of_people.
\v 20 And which immediately having_left the nets, they_followed after_him.
\v 21 And having_advanced from_there, he_saw two other brothers, Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ) the \add son\add* of_ the _Zebedaios and Yōannaʸs the brother of_him, in the boat with Zebedaios the father of_them, preparing the nets of_them, and he_called them.
\v 22 And which immediately having_left the boat and the father of_them, they_followed after_him.
\v 23 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* he_was_going_around in all the Galilaia/(Gālīl), teaching in the synagogues of_them, and proclaiming the good_message of_the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
\v 24 And the report of_him went_away into all the Suria/(ʼArām). And they_brought to_him all the \add ones\add* sickly, having with_various diseases, and being_gripped_with with_torments, being_demon_possessed, and being_epileptic, and paralytic, and he_healed them.
\v 25 And great crowds followed after_him from the Galilaia, and \add the\add*_Dekapolis, and Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and Youdaia, and beyond the Yordanaʸs/(Yardēn).
\c 5
\nb
\v 1 And having_seen the crowds, he_went_up on the mountain, and him having_sat_down, the apprentices/followers of_him approached to_him.
\v 2 And having_opened_up the mouth of_him, he_was_teaching them saying,
\v 3 Blessed \add are\add* the poor in_the spirit, because to_them is the kingdom of_the heavens.
\v 4 Blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* mourning, because they will_be_being_comforted.
\v 5 Blessed \add are\add* the gentle, because they will_be_inheriting the earth.
\v 6 Blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* hungering and thirsting the for_righteousness, because they will_be_being_satisfied.
\v 7 Blessed \add are\add* the merciful, because they will_be_being_shown_mercy.
\v 8 Blessed \add are\add* the pure the in_heart, because they will_be_seeing the \nd god\nd*.
\v 9 Blessed \add are\add* the peacemaking, because they will_be_being_called sons of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 10 Blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* having_been_persecuted on_account righteousness, because to_them is the kingdom of_the heavens.
\v 11 Blessed are_you_all whenever they_may_deride you_all and may_pursue and lying, they_may_say all evil against you_all on_account of_me.
\v 12 Be_rejoicing and be_exulting, because the reward of_you_all \add is\add* great in the heavens, because/for thus they_persecuted the prophets which before you_all.
\v 13 You_all are the salt of_the earth, but if the salt may_be_made_tasteless, with what it_will_be_being_salted? It_is_being_effective for nothing anymore, except not/lest having_been_throw out, to_be_being_trampled by the people.
\v 14 You_all are the light of_the world. \add A\add*_city lying on \add a\add*_mountain is_ not _able to_be_hidden.
\v 15 And_not they_are_lighting \add a\add*_lamp and are_putting it under the \add a\add*_basket, but on the lampstand, and it_is_shining for_all the \add ones\add* in the house.
\v 16 Thus let_ the light of_you_all _shine before the people, so_that they_may_see the good works of_you_all, and may_glorify the father of_you_all which in the heavens.
\v 17 You_all_may_ not _think that I_came to_tear_down the law or the prophets, I_came not to_tear_down, but to_fulfill.
\v 18 For/Because truly I_am_saying to_you_all, until the heaven and the earth wishfully may_pass_away, one Iota or one serif by_no_means may_ not _pass_away from the law, until wishfully all \add things\add* may_become.
\v 19 Therefore if whoever may_break the least one of_these of_the commands, and may_teach the people thus, will_be_being_called least in the kingdom of_the heavens, but whoever wishfully may_practice and may_teach, this \add one\add* will_be_being_called great in the kingdom of_the heavens.
\v 20 For/Because I_am_saying to_you_all that if the righteousness of_you_all not may_be_plentiful more of_the scribes and Farisaios_\add party\add*, by_no_means you_all_may_ not _come_in into the kingdom of_the heavens.
\v 21 You_all_heard that it_was_said to_the ancients: You_˓will˒_ not _be_murdering, and whoever, wishfully may_murder, will_be liable to_the judgement.
\v 22 But I am_saying to_you_all that everyone which being_angered by_the brother of_him, will_be liable to_the judgement, and whoever wishfully may_say to_the brother of_him: Raca, will_be liable to_the council, and whoever wishfully may_say: Foolish, will_be liable to the geenna of_ the _fire.
\v 23 Therefore if you_may_be_offering the gift of_you at the altar, and_there you_may_be_reminded that the brother of_you is_having something against you,
\v 24 leave the gift of_you there before the altar. And be_going_away, first be_reconciled to_the brother of_you, and then having_come, be_offering the gift of_you.
\v 25 Be agreeing with_the opponent of_you quickly, as_long_as which you_are with him on the way, lest the opponent may_give_ you _over to_the judge, and the judge to_the attendant, and you_will_be_being_thrown into prison.
\v 26 Truly I_am_saying to_you, by_no_means you_may_ not _come_out from_there, until wishfully you_may_give_back the last quadran.
\v 27 You_all_heard that it_was_said: You_˓will˒_ not _be_committing_adultery.
\v 28 But I am_saying to_you_all that everyone which looking at_\add a\add*_woman in_order that to_lust for_her, already committed_adultery with_her in the heart of_him.
\v 29 And if the the right eye of_you is_stumbling you, pluck_ it _out and throw \add it\add* from you, because/for it_is_benefitting for_you that one of_the members of_you may_perish, and not all the body of_you may_be_thrown into geenna.
\v 30 And if the right hand of_you is_stumbling you, cut_off it and throw \add it\add* from you, because/for it_is_benefitting for_you that one of_the members of_you may_perish, and not all the body of_you may_go_away into geenna.
\v 31 And it_was_said: Whoever wishfully may_send_away the wife of_him, let_him_give divorce to_her.
\v 32 But I am_saying to_you_all that everyone which sending_away the wife of_him, except on_account of_sexual_immorality, is_making her to_be_committing_adultery, and whoever may_marry if having_been_sent_ \add her\add* _away, is_causing_adultery.
\v 33 Again you_all_heard that it_was_said to_the ancients: You_˓will˒_ not _be_perjuring, but you_will_be_giving_back to_the \nd master\nd* the oaths of_you.
\v 34 But I am_saying to_you_all not to_ actually _swear, neither by the heaven, because it_is \add the\add*_throne of_ the _\nd god\nd*, 
\v 35 nor by the earth, because it_is \add the\add*_footstool of_the feet of_him, nor in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), because it_is \add the\add*_city of_the great king, 
\v 36 nor may_you_swear by the head of_you, because you_are_ not _being_able to_make one hair white. or black.
\v 37 But let_be the statement of_you_all, yes \add be\add* yes, no \add be\add* no, and the additional \add than\add* these \add things\add* is from the evil.
\v 38 You_all_heard that it_was_said: Eye for \add an\add*_eye and tooth for \add a\add*_tooth.
\v 39 But I am_saying to_you_all, not to_resist against_the evil, but whoever is_slapping \add you\add* you on the right cheek, of_you turn to_him also the other, 
\v 40 and to_the \add one\add* willing you to_be_judged and to_take the tunic of_you, allow your coat to_him also, 
\v 41 and whoever will_be_compelling you one mile, be_going with him two.
\v 42 Give to_the \add one\add* requesting you, and you_may_ not _be_turned_away to_the \add one\add* wanting to_borrow from you.
\v 43 You_all_heard that it_was_said: You_will_be_loving the neighbor of_you, and you_will_be_hating the enemy of_you.
\v 44 But I am_saying to_you_all, be_loving the enemies of_you_all, and be_praying for the \add ones\add* persecuting you_all, 
\v 45 so_that you_all_may_become sons of_the father of_you_all who in \add the\add*_heavens, because he_is_rising the sun of_him on evil and good, and is_raining on \add the\add*_righteous and unrighteous.
\v 46 For/Because if you_all_may_love the \add ones\add* loving you_all, what reward are_you_all_having? Not also the tax_collectors are_doing the same?
\v 47 And if you_all_may_greet the brothers of_you_all only, what additional \add things\add* are_you_all_doing? Not also the pagans are_doing the same?
\v 48 Therefore you_all will_be perfect as the heavenly father of_you_all the is perfect.

\v 1 Be_taking_heed not to_be_practicing the righteousness of_you_all before the people, in_order that to_be_seen by_them, and if not, surely you_all_are_having no reward with the father of_you_all, who \add is\add* in the heavens.
\v 2 Therefore whenever you_may_be_doing alms, you_may_ not _trumpet before you, as the hypocrites are_doing in the synagogues and in the streets, so_that they_may_be_glorified by the people. Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, they_are_receiving_fully the reward of_them.
\v 3 But of_you doing alms, not let_know the left \add hand\add* of_you what the right \add hand\add* of_you is_doing,
\v 4 so_that the alms of_you may_be in the secret, and the father of_you, the \add one\add* seeing in the secret, will_be_giving_back to_you.
\v 5 And whenever you_may_be_praying, you_all_will_ not _be like the hypocrites, because they_are_loving to_be_praying in the synagogues and having_stood on the corners of_the roads, so_that they_may_be_seen by_the people. Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, they_are_receiving_fully the reward of_them.
\v 6 But you whenever you_may_be_praying, come_in into the private_room of_you and having_shut the door of_you, pray to_the father of_you, who \add is\add* in the secret, and the father of_you, the \add one\add* seeing in the secret, will_be_giving_back to_you.
\v 7 And praying, you_all_may_ not _babble as the pagans for they_are_supposing that in the many_messages of_them they_will_be_being_listened_to.
\v 8 Therefore you_all_may_ not _be_likened to_them, because/for the \nd god\nd* the father of_you_all has_known what \add things\add* you_all_are_having need before the \add time\add* you_all to_request him.
\v 9 Therefore you_all be_praying thus: father of_us, the \add one\add* in the heavens, let_ the name of_you _be_sanctified.
\v 10 ˓Let˒_ the kingdom of_you _come, let_be_ the will of_you _become, on earth also as in heaven.
\v 11 Give to_us today the the daily_needed bread of_us.
\v 12 And forgive to_us the debts of_us, as we also forgave to_the debtors of_us.
\v 13 And you_may_ not _carry_in us into temptation, but rescue us from the evil.
\v 14 For/Because if you_all_may_forgive to_ the _people the transgressions of_them, the the heavenly father of_you_all ˓will˒_ also _be_forgiving to_you_all.
\v 15 But if you_all_may_ not _forgive to_ the _people the transgressions of_them, neither ˓will˒_ the father of_you_all _be_forgiving the transgressions of_you_all.
\v 16 And whenever you_all_may_be_fasting, be_ not _becoming downthrow like the hypocrites, because/for they_are_disfiguring the appearances of_them, so_that they_may_be_seen by_the people fasting. Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, they_are_receiving_fully the reward of_them.
\v 17 But you fasting, anoint the head of_you and wash the face of_you,
\v 18 so_that you_may_ not _be_seen by_the people fasting, but to_the father of_you who \add is\add* in the secret, and the father of_you, the \add one\add* seeing in the secret, will_be_giving_back to_you.
\v 19 Be_ not _storing_up treasures on the earth for_you_all, where moth and corrosion is_destroying, and where thieves are_digging_through and are_stealing, 
\v 20 but be_storing_up for_you_all treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor corrosion is_destroying, and where thieves are_ not _digging_through nor are_stealing.
\v 21 For/Because where the treasure of_you is, the heart of_you will_be there also.
\v 22 The lamp of_the body is the eye. Therefore if the eye of_you may_be healthy, the whole body of_you will_be bright.
\v 23 But if the eye of_you may_be evil, all the body of_you will_be dark. Therefore if the light which in you \add is\add* darkness, how_great is the darkness. 
\v 24 No_one is_able to_be_serving for_two masters, because/for either he_will_be_hating the one and he_will_be_loving the other, or he_will_be_upholding of_\add the\add*_one and he_will_be_despising of_the other. You_all_are_ not _being_able to_be_serving for_\nd god\nd* and money.
\v 25 Because_of this I_am_saying to_you_all, be_ not _worrying for_the life of_you_all, what you_all_may_eat or what you_all_may_drink, nor for_the body of_you_all what you_all_may_dress_in. Not the life is more \add than\add* the food, and the body \add than\add* the clothing?
\v 26 Consider on the birds of_the sky, that they_are_ neither _sowing, nor are_they_reaping, nor are_they_gathering_together into barns, and the the heavenly father of_you_all is_feeding them, are_ not you_all _carrying_value more \add than\add* them?
\v 27 And who of you_all worrying is_able to_add one hour to the lifespan of_him?
\v 28 And about clothing why are_you_all_worrying? Observe how the lilies of_the field are_growing, they_are_ not _labouring nor are_they_spinning, 
\v 29 but I_am_saying to_you_all that not_even Solomōn/(Shəlmoh) in all the glory of_him clothed like one of_these.
\v 30 But if the \nd god\nd* is_ thus _dressing the grass of_the field being today, and tomorrow being_thrown into \add the\add*_furnace, not by_much more for_you_all, little_faith \add ones\add*?
\v 31 Therefore you_all_may_ not _worry saying: What may_we_eat, or: What may_we_drink, or: What may_we_clothed?
\v 32 For/Because the pagans are_seeking_after all these \add things\add*, because/for the the heavenly father of_you_all has_known that you_all_are_needing of_ all _these \add things\add*.
\v 33 But be_seeking first the kingdom and the righteousness of_him, and all these \add things\add* will_be_being_added to_you_all.
\v 34 Therefore you_all_may_ not _worry for the_ next _\add day\add*, because/for the_ next _\add day\add* will_be_worrying about_itself. The evil of_it sufficient to_the day \add is\add*.

\v 1 Be_ not _judging, in_order_that you_all_may_ not _be_judged,

\v 3 And why you_are_looking the speck which in the eye of_the brother of_you, but you_are_ not _observing the \add speck\add* beam in the your eye?
\v 4 Or how you_will_be_saying to_the brother of_you: Allow \add that\add* I_may_throw_out the speck from the eye of_you, and see, the beam \add is\add* in the eye of_you?
\v 5 Hypocrite, first throw_out the beam from the eye of_you, and then you_will_be_seeing_clearly to_throw_out the speck from the eye of_the brother of_you.
\v 6 You_all_may_ not _give the holy \add thing\add* to_the dogs, nor may_you_all_throw the pearls of_you_all before the pigs, lest they_will_be_trampling them with the feet of_them, and having_been_turned they_may_attack you_all.
\v 7 Be_requesting and it_will_be_being_given to_you_all, be_seeking and you_all_will_be_finding, be_knocking and it_will_be_being_opened_up to_you_all.
\v 8 For/Because everyone which requesting is_receiving, and the \add one\add* seeking is_finding, and to_the \add one\add* knocking it_will_be_being_opened_up.
\v 9 Or which \add a\add*_person is of you_all, whom the son of_him will_be_requesting \add a\add*_loaf, not will_be_handing_out \add a\add*_stone to_him?
\v 10 Or also will_be_requesting \add a\add*_fish, not will_be_handing_out \add a\add*_serpent to_him?
\v 11 Therefore if you_all being evil, have_known to_be_giving good gifts to_the children of_you_all, to_how_much more the father of_you_all who \add is\add* in the heavens will_be_giving good \add things\add* to_the \add ones\add* requesting him?
\v 12 Therefore all \add things\add*, if as_many_as you_all_may_be_wanting that the people may_be_doing to_you_all, thus you_all also be_doing to_them. For/Because this is the law and the prophets.
\v 13 Come_in through the narrow gate, because the gate \add is\add* wide and the way \add is\add* broad which leading_away to the destruction, and many are the \add ones\add* coming_in through it,

\v 15 Be_taking_heed of the false_prophets, who are_coming to you_all in clothing of_sheep, but inside they_are swindling wolves.
\v 16 You_all_will_be_knowing them by the fruits of_them. Surely_not they_are_gathering grapes from thorns, or figs from thistles?
\v 17 Thus every good tree is_producing good fruits, but the bad tree is_producing evil fruits.
\v 18 \add A\add*_ good _tree is_ not _able to_bear evil fruits, nor \add a\add*_ bad _tree to_be_producing good fruits.
\v 19 Every tree not producing good fruit is_being_cut_off and is_being_thrown into fire.
\v 20 Consequently surely you_all_will_be_knowing them by the fruits of_them.
\v 21 Not everyone which saying to_me: \nd master\nd*, \nd master\nd*, will_be_coming_in into the kingdom of_the heavens, but the \add one\add* doing the will of_the father of_me who \add is\add* in the heavens.

\v 23 And then I_will_be_confessing to_them, that I_ never _knew you_all: be_going_away from me, you_all working the lawlessness.
\v 24 Therefore everyone whoever is_hearing the these messages of_me and is_doing them, they_will_be_being_likened to_\add a\add*_ prudent _man, who built the house of_him on the rock.
\v 25 And the rain came_down, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they_fell_against to_ the that _house, and it_ not _fell, because/for it_had_been_established on the rock.

\v 13 And if on_one_hand the house may_be worthy, let_ the peace of_you_all _come on it, on_the_other_hand if may_be not worthy, let_ the peace of_you_all _be_returned to you_all.

\v 1 And it_became when the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* finished directing to_the twelve apprentices/followers of_him, he_departed from_there which to_be_teaching and to_be_proclaiming in the cities of_them.
\v 2 And the Yōannaʸs, having_heard in the prison the works of_the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, having_sent through of_the apprentices/followers of_him,
\v 3 said to_him: Are you the \add one\add* coming, or are_we_waiting for_another?

\v 6 And he_is blessed who if may_ not _be_offended in me.
\v 7 And these going, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* began to_be_saying to_the crowds concerning Yōannaʸs, you_all_came_out into the wilderness to_see What? \add A\add*_reed being_shaken by wind?
\v 8 But you_all_came_out to_see what? \add A\add*_man having_been_dressed in fine \add clothes\add*? Behold, the \add ones\add* wearing the fine \add clothes\add* in the houses of_the kings
\v 9 but why you_all_came_out? To_see \add a\add*_prophet? Yes, I_am_saying to_you_all, and more_important \add than\add* \add a\add*_prophet.
\v 10 This \add one\add* is concerning whom it_has_been_written: Behold, I am_sending_out the messenger of_me before \add the\add*_face of_you, who will_be_preparing the way of_you before you.

\v 12 And from the days of_Yōannaʸs the immerser until now, the kingdom of_the heavens is_forcing, and forceful_men they_are_snatching it.
\v 13 For/Because all the prophets and the law prophesied until Yōannaʸs.
\v 14 And if you_all_are_willing to_receive \add it\add*, he is Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*), the \add one\add* going to_be_coming.
\v 15 The \add one\add* having ears to_be_hearing, let_him_be_hearing.
\v 16 But to_what I_will_be_likening the this generation? It_is similar to_little_children sitting in the marketplaces, who calling_out to_the others
\v 17 are_saying: We_played_the_flute for_you_all and you_all_ not _danced, we_lamented and you_all_ not _mourn.
\v 18 For/Because Yōannaʸs came neither eating nor drinking, and they_are_saying: He_is_having \add a\add*_demon.
\v 19 The son of_ the _man came eating and drinking, and they_are_saying: Behold, \add a\add*_man, \add a\add*_glutton and \add a\add*_drunkard, \add a\add*_friend of_tax_collectors and of_sinners. But the wisdom was_justified by the her children.
\v 20 Then he_began to_be_deriding the cities in which the most miracles of_him became, because they_ not _repented.
\v 21 Woe to_you, Ⱪorazin. Woe to_you, Baʸthsaida. Because if the miracles which having_become in you_all became in Turos/(Tsor) and Sidōn/(Tsīdōn), long_ago they_ would _repented in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 22 However I_am_saying to_you_all, it_will_be more_tolerable for_Turos and Sidōn in day of_judgement than for_you_all.
\v 23 Also you, Kafarnaʼoum, ˓will˒_ not _be_being_exalted to heaven? You_will_be_coming_down to Haidaʸs. Because if the miracles which having_become in you were_become in Sodoma/(Şədom), would remained until the \add day\add* today.

\v 25 At that the time the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answering said: I_am_confessing to_you, father, \nd master\nd* of_the heaven and the earth, that you_hid these \add things\add* from wise and intelligent, and you_revealed them to_infants.
\v 26 Yes, the father, because thus it_became good_pleasure before you.

\v 1 At that the time, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_gone on_the days_of_rest through the grainfields, and the \add the\add*_apprentices/followers of_him hungered, and began to_be_plucking heads_of_grain and to_be_eating.

\v 19 He_˓will˒_ not _be_quarrelling, nor will_be_crying_out, nor ˓will˒_ anyone _be_hearing the voice of_him in the roads.

\v 21 And \add the\add*_pagans will_be_hoping in_the name of_him.
\v 22 Then \add a\add*_being_demon_possessed \add man\add* was_brought to_him, blind and mute, and he_healed him, so_that the mute \add man\add* to_be_speaking and to_be_seeing.
\v 23 And all the crowds were_marvelling and were_saying: Surely_not this \add one\add* is the son of_Dawid/(Dāvid)?
\v 24 And the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_heard said: This \add man\add* is_ not _throwing_out the demons, except not/lest by the Beʼelzeboul, ruler of_the demons.
\v 25 And having_known the thoughts of_them, he_said to_them: Every kingdom having_been_divided against itself is_being_desolated, and every city or house having_been_divided against itself ˓will˒_ not _be_being_stood.
\v 26 And if the Satan/(Sāţān) is_throwing_out the Satan, he_was_divided against himself. Therefore how ˓will˒_ the kingdom of_him _be_being_established?
\v 27 And if I am_throwing_out the demons by Beʼelzeboul, by whom the sons of_you_all are_they_throwing_out? Because_of this, they will_be judges of_you_all.
\v 28 But if I am_throwing_out the demons by \add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd* of_\nd god\nd*, consequently the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* came on you_all.
\v 29 Or how is_ anyone _able to_come_in into the house of_the strong \add man\add* and to_snatch the goods of_him, if not first he_may_bind the strong \add man\add*? And then he_will_be_thoroughly_plundering the household of_him.
\v 30 The \add one\add* not being with me is against me, and the \add one\add* not gathering_together with me is_scattering.
\v 31 Because_of this I_am_saying to_you_all, every sin and slander will_be_being_forgiven to_the people, but the slander of_the \nd spirit\nd* ˓will˒_ not _be_being_forgiven.
\v 32 And if whoever may_speak \add a\add*_message against the son of_ the _Man, it_will_be_being_forgiven to_him, but whoever wishfully may_speak against the the holy \nd spirit\nd*, it_˓will˒_ not _be_being_forgiven to_him, neither in this the age nor in the \add one\add* coming.

\v 35 The good person is_sending_forth good out_of his good treasure, and the evil person is_sending_forth evil out_of his evil treasure.
\v 36 But I_am_saying to_you_all that every idle message that the people will_be_speaking, they_will_be_giving_back \add an\add*_account for it in day of_judgement.
\v 37 For/Because you_will_be_being_justified by the messages of_you, and you_will_be_being_convicted by the messages of_you.
\v 38 Then some of_the scribes and Farisaios_\add party\add* answered to_him saying: Teacher, we_are_wanting to_see \add a\add*_sign from you.

\v 41 \add The\add*_ Nineuitaʸs/(\add ones\add*_from_Nīnəvēh) _men will_be_standing_up in the judgement with the this generation, and they_will_be_condemning it, because they_repented at the proclamation of_Yōnas, and see, \add one\add*_greater \add than\add* Yōnas \add is\add* here.
\v 42 \add The\add*_queen of_\add the\add*_south will_be_being_raised in the judgement with the this generation, and will_be_condemning it, because she_came from the ends of_the earth to_hear the wisdom of_Solomōn/(Shəlmoh), and see, \add one\add*_greater \add than\add* Solomōn \add is\add* here.

\v 1 In the that day, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_come_out from_the house, was_sitting by the sea.

\v 4 And in the \add time\add* to_be_sowing of_him, some on_one_hand fell along the road, and the birds came and devoured them.
\v 5 On_the_other_hand others fell on the rocky \add places\add*, where it_was_ not _having much soil, and immediately it_sprang_up because_of the to_be_ not _having depth of_soil,
\v 6 but \add the\add*_sun having_risen, it_was_scorched and because_of that to_be_ not _having root it_was_withered.
\v 7 On_the_other_hand others fell on the thorns, and the thorns went_up and choked_ them _out.
\v 8 On_the_other_hand others fell on the the good soil, and was_giving fruit, some on_one_hand \add a\add*_hundred, on_the_other_hand some sixty, on_the_other_hand some thirty.
\v 9 The \add one\add* having ears, let_him_be_hearing.
\v 10 And the apprentices/followers having_approached said to_him: For/Because_ why _reason are_you_speaking to_them in parables?
\v 11 And he answering said to_them: Because to_you_all has_been_given to_know the mysteries of_the kingdom of_the heavens, but to_those it_has_ not _˓been˒_given.
\v 12 For/Because whoever is_having, will_be_being_given to_him and he_will_be_being_in_abundance, but whoever is_ not _having, even what he_is_having will_be_being_taken_away from him.
\v 13 Because_of this I_am_speaking in parables to_them, because seeing they_are_ not _seeing, and hearing they_are_ not _hearing, nor are_they_understanding.
\v 14 And the prophecy of_Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊ\sup yāh\sup*) is_being_fulfilled to_them which saying: With_hearing you_all_will_be_hearing but by_no_means you_all_may_ not _understand, and seeing you_all_will_be_seeing but by_no_means you_all_may_ not _perceive.
\v 15 For/Because the heart of_ the this _people was_become_dull, and they_ hardly _heard with_the ears, and they_shut the eyes of_them, lest they_may_see with_the eyes, and they_may_hear with_the ears, and they_may_understand with_the heart, and they_may_return and I_will_be_healing them.
\v 16 But blessed \add are\add* the eyes of_you_all because they_are_seeing, and the ears of_you_all because they_are_hearing.
\v 17 For/Because, truly I_am_saying to_you_all that many prophets and righteous \add men\add* desired to_see what you_all_are_seeing, and they_ not _saw, and to_hear what you_all_are_hearing, and they_ not _heard.
\v 18 Therefore you_all hear the parable of_the \add one\add* having_sown.
\v 19 Everyone hearing the message of_the kingdom and not understanding, the evil \add one\add* is_coming and is_snatching the \add one\add* having_been_sown in the heart of_him. This is the \add one\add* having_been_sown by the road.
\v 20 And the \add one\add* having_been_sown on the rocky, this is the \add one\add* hearing the message and immediately receiving it with joy,
\v 21 and is_having no root in himself, but is temporary, but tribulation or persecution having_become because_of the message, immediately he_is_being_stumbled.
\v 22 And the \add one\add* having_been_sown among the thorns, this is the \add one\add* hearing the message, and the worry of_ the _age and the seduction of_ the _riches is_choking the message, and it_is_becoming unfruitful.
\v 23 And the \add one\add* having_been_sown on the good soil, this is the \add one\add* hearing the message and understanding, who indeed is_bearing_fruit and is_producing, some on_one_hand \add a\add*_hundred, some on_the_other_hand sixty, some on_the_other_hand thirty.
\v 24 He_set_before to_them another parable saying: The kingdom of_the heavens was_likened to_\add a\add*_man having_sown good seed in the field of_him.
\v 25 But at the \add time\add* the people to_be_sleeping, the enemy of_him came and sowed darnels among midst of_the wheat and went_away.
\v 26 But when the grass sprouted and produced fruit, then the darnels was_seen also.
\v 27 And the slaves of_the home_owner having_approached said to_him: Master, you_ not _sowed good seed in the your field? Therefore from_where it_is_having darnels?
\v 28 And he was_saying to_them: \add An\add*_enemy man did this. And the slaves are_saying to_him: Therefore are_you_wanting having_gone_away, may_we_gather them?
\v 29 But he is_saying: No, lest gathering the darnels, you_all_may_uproot the wheat together_with them.
\v 30 Allow both to_be_being_grown_together until the harvest, and in \add the\add*_time of_the harvest I_will_be_saying to_the harvesters: Gather first the darnels and bind them into bundles in_order that to_burn_up them, and gather_together the wheat into the barn of_me.
\v 31 Another parable he_set_before to_them saying, the kingdom of_the heavens is Similar to_\add a\add*_seed of_mustard, which \add a\add*_man having_taken sowed in the field of_him, 
\v 32 which on_one_hand it_is smaller of_all the seeds, on_the_other_hand whenever it_may_be_grown is greater \add than\add* the garden_plants and is_becoming \add a\add*_tree, so_that the birds of_the sky to_come and to_be_nesting in the branches of_it.
\v 33 Another parable he_spoke to_them: the kingdom of_the heavens is Similar to_leaven, which \add a\add*_woman having_taken, hid_in in three satons of_wheat_flour, until all of_which was_leavened.
\v 34 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* spoke all these \add things\add* in parables to_the crowds, and he_was_speaking nothing to_them without \add a\add*_parable, 
\v 35 so_that the \add message\add* may_be_fulfilled having_been_spoken by the prophet saying: I_will_be_opening_up the mouth of_me in parables, I_will_be_uttering \add things\add* having_been_hidden from \add the\add*_foundation of_\add the\add*_world.
\v 36 Then having_sent_away the crowds, he_came into the house. And the apprentices/followers of_him approached to_him saying: Explain to_us the parable of_the darnels of_the field.
\v 37 And he answering said: The \add one\add* sowing the good seed is the son of_ the _Man, 
\v 38 and the field is the world, and the good seed, these are the sons of_the kingdom, and the darnels are the sons of_the evil \add one\add*,
\v 39 and the enemy \add is\add*, the \add one\add* having_sown them, is the devil, and the harvest is \add the\add*_completion of_\add the\add*_age, and the harvesters are messengers.
\v 40 Therefore as the darnels is_being_gathered and is_being_burned_up in_fire, thus it_will_be in the completion of_the age.
\v 41 The son of_ the _man will_be_sending_out the messengers of_him, and they_will_be_gathering out_of the kingdom of_him all the temptations and the \add ones\add* practicing the lawlessness,
\v 42 and they_will_be_throwing them into the furnace of_the fire, there will_be the weeping and the grating of_ the _teeth.
\v 43 Then the righteous will_be_shining_forth as the sun in the kingdom of_the father of_them. The \add one\add* having ears, let_him_be_hearing.
\v 44 The kingdom of_the heavens is similar to_treasure having_been_hidden in the field, which \add a\add*_man having_found hid, and from the joy of_it is_going and is_selling all as_much_as he_is_having, and is_buying the that field.
\v 45 Again the kingdom of_the heavens is similar to_\add a\add*_ merchant _man seeking beautiful pearls, 
\v 46 and having_found one precious pearl, having_gone_away, he_has_sold all \add things\add* as_many_as he_was_having, and bought it.
\v 47 Again the kingdom of_the heavens is similar to_\add a\add*_dragnet having_been_throw into the sea and having_gathered_together of every kind, 
\v 48 which when it_was_filled, having_pulled_up on the shore and having_sat_down, they_gathered the good into containers, and the bad they_throw out.
\v 49 Thus it_will_be in the completion of_the age, the messengers will_be_coming_out, and will_be_setting_apart the evil from \add the\add*_midst of_the righteous,
\v 50 and they_will_be_throwing them into the furnace of_the fire. There will_be the weeping and the grating of_ the _teeth.
\v 51 You_all_understood all these \add things\add*? They_are_saying to_him: Yes.
\v 52 And he said to_them: Because_of this, every scribe having_been_trained in_the kingdom of_the heavens is similar to_\add a\add*_man, \add a\add*_home_owner, who is_sending_forth new \add things\add* and old \add things\add* out_of the treasure of_him.
\v 53 And it_became when the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* finished the these parables, he_withdrew from_there.
\v 54 And having_come into the hometown of_him, he_was_teaching them in the synagogue of_them, so_that them to_be_being_astonished and to_be_saying: From_where to_this \add man\add* the this wisdom and the miracles \add received\add*?
\v 55 Is this not the son of_the carpenter? Not the mother of_him is_being_called Maria/(Miryām), and the brothers of_him, Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), and Yōsaʸf/(Yōşēf), and Simōn, and Youdas/(Yəhūdāh)?
\v 56 And are not the sisters of_him all with us? Therefore from_where to_this \add man\add* these \add things\add* all \add received\add*?
\v 57 And they_were_being_offended at him. But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_them: \add A\add*_prophet is not dishonourable, except not/lest in the hometown and in the house of_him.
\v 58 And he_ not _did many miracles there, because_of the unbelief of_them.

\v 24 And them having_come to Kafarnaʼoum, the \add ones\add* receiving the two_drachmas approached to_ the _Petros and said: The teacher of_you_all is_ not _paying the two_drachmas?
\v 25 He_is_saying: Yes. And having_come into the house, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* preceded him saying: What is_supposing to_you, Simōn? The kings of_the earth are_receiving revenues or poll_tax from whom_all? From the sons of_them or from the strangers?
\v 26 the Petros is_saying to_him From the strangers. And he_having_said: From the strangers, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_saying to_him: Consequently surely \add the\add*_free \add ones\add* are the sons.
\v 27 But in_order_that we_may_ not _offend them, having_been_gone to sea, throw \add a\add*_fish_hook and take_up the first fish having_gone_up, and having_opened_up the mouth of_it, you_will_be_finding \add a\add*_stater, having_taken that, give to_them for me and you.

\v 1 In that the hour the apprentices/followers approached to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd* saying: Who consequently is \add the\add*_greater in the kingdom of_the heavens?
\v 2 And having_called_to \add a\add*_little_child, he_stood it in midst of_them
\v 3 and said: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, if you_all_may_ not _be_turned and may_become as the little_children, by_no_means you_all_may_ not _come_in into the kingdom of_the heavens.
\v 4 Therefore whoever will_be_humbling himself as the this little_child, this \add one\add* is the greater in the kingdom of_the heavens.
\v 5 And whoever if may_receive one such little_child in the name of_me, is_receiving me.
\v 6 But whoever wishfully may_stumble one of_ the these _little \add ones\add* which believing in me, it_is_benefitting for_him that \add a\add*_ heavy _grinding_stone may_be_hanged around the neck of_him, and may_be_sunk in the depth of_the sea.
\v 7 Woe to_the world because_of the temptations. For/Because it_is necessity the temptations to_come, however woe to_the that person by whom the temptation is_coming. 
\v 8 And if the hand of_you or the foot of_you is_stumbling you, cut_ it _off and throw \add it\add* from you, it_is better for_you to_come_in into the life maimed or lame, than to_be_thrown into the the eternal fire having two hands or two feet.
\v 9 And if the eye of_you is_stumbling you, pluck_out it and throw \add it\add* from you, it_is better for_you to_come_in into the life one-eyed, than to_be_thrown into the geenna of_ the _fire having two eyes.
\v 10 Be_seeing you_all_may_ not _despise of_one of_ the these _little \add ones\add*, because/for I_am_saying to_you_all that the messengers of_them in \add the\add*_heavens, through everything are_seeing the face of_the father of_me, who \add is\add* in \add the\add*_heavens.
\v 11
\v 12 What is_it_supposing to_you_all? If it_may_become to_\add a\add*_certain man \add a\add*_hundred sheep, and one of them may_be_strayed, not, having_left the ninety nine on the mountains and having_been_gone, is_seeking the \add sheep\add* being_strayed?
\v 13 And if he_may_become to_find it, truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that he_is_rejoicing over it more than over the ninety nine which not having_been_strayed.
\v 14 Thus is not \add the\add*_will before the father of_you_all, who \add is\add* in \add the\add*_heavens, that may_perish one of_ the these _little \add ones\add*.
\v 15 And if the brother of_you may_sin, be_going, rebuke him between you and him only. If he_may_hear from_you, you_gained the brother of_you.
\v 16 But if he_may_ not _hear, take one or two more with you in_order_that on \add the\add*_mouth of_two or three witnesses, every message may_be_established.
\v 17 And if he_may_refuse_to_hear from_them, tell to_the assembly. And if he_may_ also _refuse_to_hear from_the assembly, him_let_be to_you as the pagan and the tax_collector.
\v 18 Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, as_much_as wishfully you_all_may_bind on the earth, will_be having_been_bound in heaven, and as_much_as if you_all_may_untie/release on the earth, will_be having_been_untied/released in heaven.
\v 19 Again truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that if two of you_all on the earth may_agree_together concerning any matter, of_whatever if they_may_request, it_will_be_becoming for_them by the father of_me, who \add is\add* in \add the\add*_heavens.
\v 20 For/Because where are two or three having_been_gathered_together in the my name, there I_am in \add the\add*_midst of_them.
\v 21 Then the Petros having_approached, said to_him: \nd master\nd*, how_often ˓will˒_ the brother of_me _be_sinning against me, and I_will_be_forgiving to_him? Up_to seven_times?
\v 22 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_saying to_him: I_am_ not _saying to_you up_to seven_times, but up_to seventy_times seven. 
\v 23 Because_of this the kingdom of_the heavens was_likened to_\add a\add*_man, \add a\add*_king, who wanted to_settle_accounts account with the slaves of_him.
\v 24 And of_him having_begun to_be_settling_accounts, one \add a\add*_debtor of_ten_thousand talantons\add _of_silver\add* was_brought to_him.
\v 25 But of_him not having \add means\add* to_give_back, the master commanded him to_be_sold, and the wife, and the children, and all \add things\add* as_many_as was_having, and \add payment\add* to_be_given_back.
\v 26 Therefore the slave having_fallen, was_prostrating to_him saying: Master, be_patient with me, and I_will_be_giving_ all \add things\add* _back to_you.
\v 27 And the master having_been_feeling_compassion, of_ the that _slave sent_ him _away, and he_forgave the loan to_him.
\v 28 But the that slave having_come_out, found one of_the fellow-slaves of_him, who was_owing \add a\add*_hundred daʸnarion_\add coins\add* to_him, and having_apprehended him, he_was_strangling \add him\add* saying: Give_back if anything you_are_owing.
\v 29 Therefore the fellow-slave of_him having_fallen, was_imploring him saying: Be_patient with me, and I_will_be_giving_back to_you.
\v 30 And which he_was_ not _willing, but having_gone_away, he_throw him into prison, until he_may_give_back the \add thing\add* being_owed.
\v 31 Therefore the fellow-slaves of_him, having_seen the \add things\add* having_become, they_were_ exceedingly _sorrowed, and having_come they_explained to_the master of_themselves all the \add things\add* having_become.
\v 32 Then the master of_him, having_called_to him, is_saying to_him: Evil slave, I_forgave to_you all that the obligation, because you_implored me.
\v 33 Not was_it_fitting you also to_show_mercy to_the fellow-slave of_you, as also_I shown_mercy to_you?
\v 34 And the master of_him having_been_angered, gave_ him _over to_the tormentors, until of_which he_may_give_back everything which being_owed to_him.
\v 35 Thus also the the heavenly father of_me will_be_doing to_you_all, if you_all_may_ not _forgive each to_the brother of_him from the hearts of_you_all.

\v 1 And it_became, when the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* finished the these messages, he_withdrew from the Galilaia/(Gālīl) and came to the regions of_ the _Youdaia beyond the Yordanaʸs/(Yardēn).
\v 2 And great crowds followed after_him, and he_healed them there.
\v 3 And \add the\add*_Farisaios_\add party\add* approached to_him, testing him and saying: - Is_it_permitting to_send_away the wife of_him according_to any cause?
\v 4 And which answering he_said: You_all_ not _read that he having_made \add them\add* from beginning: made them male and female?
\v 5 And he_said: On_account of_this \add a\add*_man will_be_leaving his father and his mother, and will_be_being_joined_together with_the wife of_him, and the two will_be into one flesh?
\v 6 So_that they_ no_longer _are two, but one flesh. Therefore what the \nd god\nd* joined_together, let_ man not _be_separating.
\v 7 They_are_saying to_him: Therefore why Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) commanded to_give \add a\add*_scroll of_divorce and to_send_ her _away?
\v 8 He_is_saying to_them, that For/Because the hard_heart of_you_all, Mōsaʸs permitted to_you_all to_send_away the wives of_you_all, but from \add the\add*_beginning it_has_ not _become thus.
\v 9 And I_am_saying to_you_all that whoever wishfully may_send_away the wife of_him not/lest for sexual_immorality, and may_marry another, is_causing_adultery. And the \add one\add* having_been_sent_away, marrying is_causing_adultery.
\v 10 The apprentices/followers are_saying to_him: If thus is the cause of_the husband with the wife, it_is_ not _benefitting to_marry.
\v 11 But he said to_them: Not all are_accepting the this statement, but \add those\add* to_whom it_has_been_given.
\v 12 For/Because there_are eunuchs who were_born thus from womb of_mother, and there_are eunuchs who were_castrated by the people, and there_are eunuchs who castrated themselves because_of the kingdom of_the heavens. The \add one\add* being_able to_be_accepting \add it\add*, him _let_be_accepting \add it\add*.
\v 13 Then little_children were_brought to_him in_order_that he_may_lay_on his hands on_them and he_may_pray, and the apprentices/followers gave_rebuke to_them.
\v 14 But the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said Allow the little_children and not be_forbidding them to_come to me, because/for the kingdom of_the heavens is the of_such \add children\add*.
\v 15 And having_laid_on his hands on_them, he_was_gone from_there.
\v 16 And see, one having_approached to_him said: Teacher, what good may_I_do in_order_that I_may_have eternal life?
\v 17 And he said to_him: Why are_you_asking me about the good? one is the good. But if you_are_wanting to_come_in into the life, be_keeping the commands.
\v 18 He_is_saying to_him: Which \add ones\add*? And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said, the You_˓will˒_ not _be_murdering, you_˓will˒_ not _be_committing_adultery, you_˓will˒_ not _be_stealing, you_˓will˒_ not _be_giving_false_testimony,
\v 19 Be_honouring your father and your mother, and: You_will_be_loving the neighbor of_you as yourself.
\v 20 The young_man is_saying to_him: I_kept all These \add things\add*, what am_I_lacking still?
\v 21 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_saying to_him: If you_are_wanting to_be perfect, be_going, sell the \add things\add* possessing of_you and give to_\add the\add*_poor and you_will_be_having treasure in \add the\add*_heavens, and come, be_following after_me.
\v 22 But the young_man having_heard, the statement, he_went_away being_sorrowed, because/for he_was having many properties.
\v 23 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_the apprentices/followers of_him: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that \add a\add*_rich \add one\add* will_be_coming_in into the kingdom of_the heavens difficultly.
\v 24 And again I_am_telling to_you_all, it_is easier for_\add a\add*_camel to_pass_through through \add the\add*_eye of_\add a\add*_needle than \add a\add*_rich \add one\add* to_come_in into the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 25 And the apprentices/followers having_heard, were_being_ exceedingly _astonished saying: Who consequently is_able to_be_saved?
\v 26 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_focused_in said to_them: With humans this is impossible, but with \nd god\nd* all \add things\add* possible.
\v 27 Then the Petros answering said to_him: Behold, we left all \add things\add* and followed after_you, what consequently will_be to_us?
\v 28 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_them: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that you_all who having_followed after_me in the regeneration, whenever the son of_ the _man may_sit_down on \add the\add*_throne of_glory of_him, you_all also will_be_sitting on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of_ the _Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*).
\v 29 And everyone who left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or farms, on_account the name of_me, will_be_receiving hundred_fold and will_be_inheriting eternal life.

\v 1 For/Because the kingdom of_the heavens is similar to_\add a\add*_man, \add a\add*_home_owner, who came_out together_with in_the_morning to_hire workers for the vineyard of_him.
\v 2 And having_agreed_together with the workers for \add a\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add* for_the day, he_sent_ them _out into the vineyard of_him.
\v 3 And having_come_out about \add the\add*_third hour, he_saw others having_stood idle in the marketplace, 
\v 4 and to_those he_said: You_all also be_going into the vineyard, and whatever if may_be right, I_will_be_giving to_you_all.
\v 5 And they went_away. Having_come_out again about \add the\add*_sixth and ninth hour, he_did likewise.
\v 6 And having_come_out about the eleventh, he_found others having_stood, and he_is_saying to_them: Why have_you_all_stood here idle all the day?
\v 7 They_are_saying to_him: Because no_one hired us. He_is_saying to_them: You_all be_going also into the vineyard.
\v 8 And having_become evening, the master of_the vineyard is_saying to_the manager of_him: Call the workers and give_back to_them the wage, having_begun from the last to the first.
\v 9 And the \add ones\add* having_come about the eleventh hour each received \add a\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add*.
\v 10 And the first \add ones\add* having_come thought that they_will_be_receiving more, but they each also received \add a\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add*.

\v 12 saying: These the last \add ones\add* worked one hour, and you_made them equal to_us, to_the \add ones\add* having_borne the burden of_the day and the scorching_heat.
\v 13 But he answering of_them said to_one Friend, I_am_ not _doing_wrong to_you. Not you_agreed_together for_\add a\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add* with_me?
\v 14 Take_up what \add is\add* your and be_going, but I_am_wanting to_give to_this the last as also to_you.
\v 15 Or not is_it_permitting for_me, what I_am_willing to_do with the mine? Or is the eye of_you evil, because I am good?
\v 16 Thus the last will_be first, and the first last.
\v 17 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* going_up to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), took the twelve apprentices/followers by themselves, and on the way he_said to_them,
\v 18 Behold, we_are_going_up to Hierousalaʸm, and the son of_ the _man will_be_being_given_over to_the chief_priests and scribes, and they_will_be_condemning him to_death,

\v 20 Then the mother of_the sons of_Zebedaios approached to_him with the sons of_her, prostrating and requesting something from him.
\v 21 And he said to_her: What are_you_wanting? She_is_saying to_him: Say that these the two sons of_me may_sit_down, one on \add the\add*_right and one on \add the\add*_left of_you in the kingdom of_you.
\v 22 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering said: You_all_have_ not _known what you_all_are_requesting. Are_you_all_being_able to_drink the cup which I am_going to_be_drinking? They_are_saying to_him: We_are_being_able.
\v 23 He_is_saying to_them: On_one_hand you_all_will_be_drinking the cup of_me, on_the_other_hand which to_sit_down on \add the\add*_right of_me and on \add the\add*_left, is not mine to_give, but for_whom it_has_been_prepared by the father of_me.
\v 24 And having_heard, the ten resented about the two brothers.
\v 25 But the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_called_to them said: You_all_have_known that the rulers of_the pagans are_exercising_mastership over_them, and the great \add ones\add* are_exercising_authority over_them.
\v 26 It_will_ not _be thus among you_all, but whoever if among you_all may_be_wanting to_become great, he_will_be servant of_you_all,

\v 24 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering, said to_them: Also_I Will_be_asking you_all one message, which if you_all_may_tell to_me, also_I will_be_saying to_you_all by what authority I_am_doing these \add things\add*.
\v 25 The immersion which of_Yōannaʸs, from_where was_it? From heaven or from humans? And they were_reasoning among themselves saying: If we_may_say: From heaven, he_will_be_saying to_us: Therefore for_ why _reason you_all_ not _believed in_him?
\v 26 But if we_may_say: From humans, we_are_fearing the crowd, because/for all are_having the Yōannaʸs as \add a\add*_prophet.

\v 28 But what is_it_supposing to_you_all? \add A\add*_man was_having two children. And having_approached to_the_ first _\add one\add* he_said: Child, be_going today, be_working in the vineyard of_me.
\v 29 And he answering said: I_am_ not _willing, later having_been_regretful, he_went_away.
\v 30 And having_approached to_the other \add child\add*, he_said likewise. And he answering said: I \add will\add*, master, but went_ not _away.
\v 31 Which of the two did the will of_the father? They_are_saying: The first. The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that the tax_collectors and the prostitutes are_going_before you_all into the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.

\v 33 Hear another parable: \add a\add*_man was \add a\add*_home_owner, who planted \add a\add*_vineyard, and put_ \add a\add*_fence _around to_it: and dug \add a\add*_wine-press in it, and built \add a\add*_tower, and rented_ it _out to_tenant_farmers, and travelled.

\v 36 Again he_sent_out other slaves, more than_the first, and they_did likewise to_them.
\v 37 But later he_sent_out the son of_him to them saying: They_will_be_being_swayed by_the son of_me.
\v 38 But the tenant_farmers having_seen the son, said among themselves: This is the heir, come, we_may_kill_ him _off and we_may_have the inheritance of_him.
\v 39 And having_taken him, they_throw_out \add him\add* out the vineyard and they_killed_ \add him\add* _off.
\v 40 Therefore whenever the master of_the vineyard may_come, what he_will_be_doing to_ the those _tenant_farmers?
\v 41 They_are_saying to_him: He_will_be_destroying them evil \add ones\add* miserably, and will_be_renting_out the vineyard to_other tenant_farmers, who will_be_giving_back to_him the fruits in the seasons of_them.
\v 42 The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_saying to_them: You_all_ never _read in the scriptures: \add The\add*_stone which the \add ones\add* building rejected, this was_become for \add the\add*_head of_\add the\add*_corner, this became from \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, and it_is marvellous in \add the\add*_eyes of_us?
\v 43 Because_of this I_am_saying to_you_all, that the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* will_be_being_taken_away from you_all and it_will_be_being_given to_\add a\add*_people producing the fruits of_it.
\v 44 And the \add one\add* having_fallen on the this stone, will_be_being_shattered, on but whomever wishfully it_may_fall, it_will_be_pulverizing him.
\v 45 And the chief_priests and the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_heard the parables of_him, they_knew that he_is_speaking about them.
\v 46 And seeking to_apprehend him, they_were_afraid the crowds, because they_were_having him for \add a\add*_prophet.
\c 22

\v 1 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering, again spoke to_them in parables saying,
\v 2 The kingdom of_the heavens was_likened to_\add a\add*_man, \add a\add*_king, who made \add a\add*_wedding_festivities for_the son of_him.
\v 3 And sent_out the slaves of_him, to_call the \add ones\add* having_been_invited to the wedding_festivities, and they_were_ not _willing to_come.
\v 4 Again he_sent_out other slaves saying: Say to_the \add ones\add* having_been_invited: Behold, I_have_prepared the dinner of_me, the bulls of_me, and the grain_fed having_been_sacrificed, and all \add things\add* are_ready, come to the wedding_festivities.
\v 5 But they having_neglected went_away, on_one_hand that \add one\add* to his own field, on_the_other_hand that \add one\add* to the business of_him.
\v 6 And the rest having_apprehended the slaves of_him, they_mistreated and they_killed_ \add them\add* _off.
\v 7 But the king was_angered, and having_sent the armies of_him, destroyed the those murderers, and inflamed the city of_them.
\v 8 Then he_is_saying to_the slaves of_him: On_one_hand the wedding is ready, on_the_other_hand the \add ones\add* having_been_invited were not worthy.
\v 9 Therefore be_going in the thoroughfares of_the roads, and invite as_many_as if you_all_may_find to the wedding_festivities.
\v 10 And the those slaves having_come_out into the roads, they_gathered_together all whom they_found, both evil and good, and the wedding was_filled of_reclining \add ones\add*.
\v 11 But the king having_come_in to_see the \add ones\add* reclining, he_saw there \add a\add*_man not having_dressed_in clothing of_wedding, 
\v 12 and he_is_saying to_him: Friend, how you_came_in here not having clothing of_wedding? And he was_silenced.
\v 13 Then the king said to_the servants: Having_bound \add the\add*_feet and hands of_him, throw_ him _out into the the outer darkness, there will_be the weeping and the grating of_ the _teeth.
\v 14 For/Because many are called, but few chosen.
\v 15 Then the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_been_gone, took counsel so_that they_may_trap him in message.
\v 16 And they_are_sending_out to_him the apprentices/followers of_them with the supporters_of_Haʸrōdaʸs saying: Teacher, we_have_known that you_are true, and you_are_teaching the way of_ the _\nd god\nd* in truth, and it_is_ not _caring to_you about no_one, because/for you_are_ not _looking on appearance of_people.
\v 17 Therefore tell to_us, what is_it_supposing to_you? Is_it_permitting to_give poll_tax to_Kaisar or not?
\v 18 But the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_known the wickedness of_them, he_said: Why are_you_all_testing me, hypocrites?
\v 19 Show to_me the coin of_the poll_tax. And they brought \add a\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add* to_him.
\v 20 And he_is_saying to_them: Of_whose_ The image _\add is\add* this and the inscription?
\v 21 They_are_saying: Of_Kaisar. Then he_is_saying to_them: Therefore give_back the \add things\add* of_Kaisar to_Kaisar, and the \add things\add* of_ the _\nd god\nd* to_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 22 And having_heard, they_marvelled, and having_left him they_went_away.
\v 23 On that the day Saddoukaios_\add sect\add* approached to_him saying not to_be \add a\add*_resurrection, and they_asked him
\v 24 saying: Teacher, Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) said: If anyone may_die_off not having children, the brother of_him will_be_marrying the wife of_him, and he_will_be_raising_up children for_the brother of_him.
\v 25 And they_were seven brothers among us, and the first having_married died, and not having seed, left the wife of_him to_the brother of_him.
\v 26 Likewise also the second, and the third, to the seven,
\v 27 and last of_all, the woman died_off.
\v 28 Therefore in the resurrection, she_will_be \add the\add*_wife of_which of_the seven? For/Because all had her.
\v 29 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answering said to_them: You_all_are_being_strayed, not having_known the scriptures nor the power of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 30 For/Because in the resurrection, they_are_ neither _marrying nor are_being_betrothed, but they_are like messengers in the heaven.
\v 31 But concerning the resurrection of_the dead, you_all_ not _read the \add message\add* having_been_spoken to_you_all by the \nd god\nd* saying,
\v 32 I am the \nd god\nd* of_Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām), and the \nd god\nd* of_Isaʼak/(Yiʦḩāq), and the \nd god\nd* of_Yakōb/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ)? The \nd god\nd* is not of_\add the\add*_dead, but of_\add the\add*_living.
\v 33 And the crowds having_heard, they_were_being_astonished at the teaching of_him.
\v 34 But the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_heard that he_silenced the Saddoukaios_\add sect\add*, were_gathered_together with the same.
\v 35 And one of them, \add a\add*_lawyer testing him asked,
\v 36 Teacher, which command \add is\add* great in the law?
\v 37 And he was_saying to_him: You_will_be_loving \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* the \nd god\nd* of_you with all heart of_you, and with all soul of_you, and with all the mind of_you.
\v 38 This is the great and first command.
\v 39 \add The\add*_second, similar to_it: You_will_be_loving the neighbor of_you as yourself.
\v 40 All the law and the prophets is_being_hanged on these the two commands.
\v 41 And the Farisaios_\add party\add* having_been_gathered_together, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* asked them
\v 42 saying: What is_supposing to_you_all concerning the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*? Of_whom son is_he? They_are_saying to_him: Of_the \add son\add* of_Dawid/(Dāvid).
\v 43 He_is_saying to_them: Therefore how is_ Dawid in \nd spirit\nd* _calling him \nd master\nd* saying,
\v 44 \add The\add*_\nd master\nd* said to_the \nd master\nd* of_me: Be_sitting on \add the\add*_right of_me, until wishfully I_may_put the enemies of_you beneath for_the feet of_you?
\v 45 Therefore if Dawid is_calling him: \nd master\nd*, how is_he \add the\add*_son of_him?
\v 46 And no_one was_able to_answer \add a\add*_message to_him, nor dared anyone from that the day to_ask him no_longer.

\v 1 Then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* spoke to_the crowds and to_the apprentices/followers of_him

\v 3 Therefore all \add things\add* as_much_as wishfully they_may_tell to_you_all, do and be_keeping, but be_ not _doing according_to the works of_them, because/for they_are_speaking and they_are_ not _doing.

\v 14
\v 15 Woe to_you_all, scribes and Farisaios_\add party\add*, hypocrites. Because you_all_are_going_around the sea and the dry \add land\add* to_make one convert, and whenever he_may_become, you_all_are_making him \add a\add*_son of_geenna twice_more \add than\add* you_all.

\v 23 Woe to_you_all, scribes and Farisaios_\add party\add*, hypocrites. Because you_all_are_tithing the mint and the dill and the cummin, and you_all_left the heavier of_the law: the justice and the mercy and the faith. But it_was_fitting to_do these \add things\add*, and_those not to_leave.

\v 4 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering said to_them: Be_watching_out lest anyone may_mislead you_all.
\v 5 For/Because many will_be_coming in the name of_me saying: I am the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, and they_will_be_misleading many.

\v 22 And except the those days not/lest were_shortened, not any flesh would was_saved, but because_of the chosen, the those days will_be_being_shortened.

\v 27 For/Because as the lightning is_coming_out from \add the\add*_east and is_shining as_far_as \add the\add*_west, thus will_be the coming of_the son of_ the _Man.

\v 20 And having_approached the \add one\add* having_received the five talantons\add _of_silver\add*, brought \add the\add*_other five talantons\add _of_silver\add* saying, Five talantons\add _of_silver\add*, master, you_gave_over to_me, see, I_gained. another five talantons\add _of_silver\add*.
\v 21 The master of_him was_saying to_him: Well \add done\add*, good and faithful slave. You_were faithful over \add a\add*_few \add things\add*, I_will_be_appointing you over many \add things\add*, come_in into the joy of_the master of_you.

\v 27 Therefore it_was_fitting you to_put the silver_coins of_me to_the bankers, and having_come, I would received_back the mine with interest.

\v 29 For/Because to_everyone which having will_be_being_given and will_be_being_in_abundance, but the \add one\add* not having, even what he_is_having will_be_being_taken_away from him.
\v 30 And throw_out the useless slave into the the outer darkness. There will_be the weeping and the grating of_ the _teeth.

\v 1 And it_became when the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* finished all the these messages, he_said to_the apprentices/followers of_him,
\v 2 You_all_have_known that after two days the passover_\add feast\add* is_becoming, and the son of_ the _man is_being_given_over in_order that to_be_executed_on_a_stake.
\v 3 Then the chief_priests and the elders of_the people were_gathered_together in the courtyard of_the chief_priest, who being_called Kaiafas,

\v 8 But the apprentices/followers having_seen, resented saying: For/Because why the this destruction?
\v 9 For/Because this was_able to_be_sold for_much and to_be_given to_\add the\add*_poor.
\v 10 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_known, said to_them: Why are_you_all_bringing_about troubles to_the women? For/Because she_did \add a\add*_ beautiful _work to me.
\v 11 For/Because you_all_are_ always _having the poor with yourselves, but you_all_are_ not always _having me.

\v 14 Then one of_the twelve who being_called Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) Iskariōtaʸs, having_been_gone to the chief_priests
\v 15 he_said: What are_you_all_willing to_give to_me, and_I will_be_giving_ him _over to_you_all? And they they_set to_him thirty silver_coins.

\v 22 And being_ exceedingly _sorrowed, each one of_them they_began to_be_saying to_him: Surely_not I am, \nd master\nd*?
\v 23 And he answering said: The \add one\add* having_dipped_in his hand with me in the bowl, this \add one\add* will_be_giving_ me _over.
\v 24 On_one_hand the son of_ the _man is_going as it_has_been_written about him, on_the_other_hand woe to_the that man by whom the son of_ the _man is_being_given_over. It_was better for_him, if the that man was_ not _born.
\v 25 And Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) who giving_ him _over, answering said: Surely_not I am, my_great_\add one\add*? He_is_saying to_him: You said \add it\add*.
\v 26 And of_them eating, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_taken bread and having_blessed, he_broke \add it\add* and having_given to_the apprentices/followers said: Take, eat, this is the body of_me.

\v 30 And having_sung_hymns, they_came_out to the Mount of_ the _Olives.
\v 31 Then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: All of_you_all will_be_being_stumbled in me at the this night, because/for it_has_been_written: I_will_be_striking the shepherd, and the sheep of_the flock will_be_being_scattered.
\v 32 But after which me to_be_raised, will_be_going_before you_all into the Galilaia/(Gālīl).
\v 33 But the Petros answering said to_him: If all will_be_being_stumbled in you, I never will_be_being_stumbled.
\v 34 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_saying to_him: Truly, I_am_saying to_you that at this the night before \add the\add*_rooster to_crow, three-times you_will_be_renouncing me.
\v 35 The Petros is_saying to_him: Even_if it_may_be_fitting me to_die_off with you, by_no_means I_˓will˒_ not _be_renouncing you. All the apprentices/followers also said likewise.
\v 36 Then the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* is_coming with them to \add a\add*_property being_called Gethsaʸmanaʸ, and he_is_saying to_the apprentices/followers: Sit_down here until of_which having_gone_away there, I_may_pray.
\v 37 And having_taken the Petros and the two sons of_Zebedaios, he_began to_be_being_sorrowed and to_be_distressing.
\v 38 Then he_is_saying to_them: The soul of_me is very_sorrowful to death, remain here and be_watching with me.
\v 39 And having_approached \add a\add*_little, he_fell on \add the\add*_face of_him, praying and saying: father of_me, if it_is possible, let_ the this cup _pass_by from me. However not as I am_wanting, but as you.

\v 41 Be_watching and be_praying, in_order_that you_all_may_ not _come_in into temptation. On_one_hand the spirit \add is\add* eager, on_the_other_hand the \add the\add*_flesh \add is\add* weak.
\v 42 Again having_gone_away for \add a\add*_second, he_prayed saying: father of_me, if this is_ not _able to_pass_by, if I_may_ not _drink it, let_ the will of_you _be_become.
\v 43 And having_come again, he_found them sleeping, because/for the eyes of_them were having_been_weighed_down.
\v 44 And having_left them again, having_gone_away, he_prayed for \add the\add*_third \add time\add* having_said the same statement again.
\v 45 Then he_is_coming to the apprentices/followers and is_saying to_them: You_all_are_sleeping for_the rest and you_all_are_resting? Behold, the hour has_neared, and the son of_ the _man is_being_given_over into \add the\add*_hands of_sinners.
\v 46 Be_being_raised, we_may_be_going. Behold, the \add one\add* giving_ me _over has_neared.

\v 50 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_him: Friend, because/for what are_you_coming? Then having_approached, they_laid_on their hands on the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, and they_apprehended him.
\v 51 And see, one of_the \add ones\add* with \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, having_stretched_out his hand, drew_out the sword of_him, and having_struck the slave of_the chief_priest, cut_off the ear of_him.
\v 52 Then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him: Turn_away the sword of_you into the place of_it, because/for all the \add ones\add* having_taken \add the\add*_sword, will_be_perishing by \add the\add*_sword.
\v 53 Or are_you_supposing that I_am_ not _being_able now to_appeal the father of_me, and he_will_be_standing_ more twelve of_legions of_messengers _before before_me?
\v 54 Therefore how may_ The scriptures _be_fulfilled, that thus it_is_fitting to_become?
\v 55 In that the hour, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_the crowds: You_all_came_out with swords and clubs to_capture me as against \add a\add*_robber? In_every day in the temple, I_was_sitting teaching, and you_all_ not _apprehended me.
\v 56 But this all has_become, in_order_that the \add things\add* scriptures of_the prophets may_be_fulfilled. Then all the apprentices/followers, having_left him fled.
\v 57 And the \add ones\add* having_apprehended the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, led_ \add him\add* _away to Kaiafas the chief_priest, where the scribes and the elders were_gathered_together.
\v 58 But the Petros was_following after_him from afar to the courtyard of_the chief_priest, and having_come_in inside, he_was_sitting with the attendants to_see the outcome.
\v 59 And the chief_priests and the whole council were_seeking false_witness against the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* so_that they_may_put_ him _to_death,
\v 60 but of_many false_witnesses having_approached, they_ not _found. But later, two having_approached
\v 61 said: This \add man\add* was_saying: I_am_being_able to_tear_down the temple of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and to_build \add it\add* it by of_three days.
\v 62 And the chief_priest having_stood_up, said to_him: Are_you_answering nothing, what these \add men\add* are_testifying against_you?
\v 63 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_keeping_silent. And the chief_priest said to_him: I_am_adjuring you by the which living \nd god\nd* that you_may_tell to_us if you are the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, the son of_the \nd god\nd*.
\v 64 The \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_him: You said \add it\add*. However I_am_saying to_you_all, from now you_all_will_be_seeing the son of_ the _Man: sitting on \add the\add*_right of_ the _power, and coming in the clouds of_the sky.
\v 65 Then the chief_priest tore the robes of_him saying: He_slandered, why are_we_having anymore need of_witnesses? Behold, now you_all_heard the slander.
\v 66 What is_it_supposing to_you_all? And which answering they_said: He_is liable of_death.
\v 67 Then they_spat in the face of_him, and they_beat him and they slapped \add him\add*
\v 68 saying: Prophesy to_us, \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, who is the \add one\add* having_struck you?
\v 69 And the Petros was_sitting outside in the courtyard, and one servant_girl approached to_him saying: You also were_were with \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* the Galilaios.
\v 70 But he disowned \add him\add* before all saying: I_have_ not _known what you_are_saying.
\v 71 And having_come_out to the gate, another saw him and she_is_saying to_the \add ones\add* there: This \add man\add* was with \nd Yaʸsous\nd* the from_Nazaret.
\v 72 And again he_disowned with \add an\add*_oath, that I_have_ not _known the man.
\v 73 And after \add a\add*_little, the \add ones\add* having_stood having_approached said to_ the _Petros: Truly also you are of them, because/for even the speech of_you is_making you evident.
\v 74 Then he_began to_be_cursing and to_be_swearing, that I_have_ not _known the man. And immediately \add a\add*_rooster crowed.
\v 75 And the Petros was_reminded of_the message of_\nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_said, that Before \add the\add*_rooster to_crow, you_will_be_renouncing me three-times. And having_come_out out, he_wept bitterly.

\v 1 And having_become in_the_morning, all the chief_priests and the elders of_the people took counsel against the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, so_that to_put_ him _to_death, 
\v 2 and having_bound him, they_led_away and gave_ \add him\add* _over to_Pilatos the governor.
\v 3 Then Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) the \add one\add* giving_ him _over, having_seen that he_was_condemned, having_been_regretful, he_returned the thirty silver_coins to_the chief_priests and elders

\v 12 And in that to_ him _be_being_accused by the chief_priests and the elders, he_answered nothing.

\v 14 And he_ not _answered to_him, to not_even one message, so_as to_be_marvelling the governor exceedingly.

\v 16 And they_were_having then \add the\add*_ notable _prisoner being_called Barabbas.
\v 17 Therefore of_them having_been_gathered_together, the Pilatos said to_them: Whom are_you_all_willing I_may_send_away to_you_all, Barabbas or \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, who \add is\add* being_called \add the\add*_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*?
\v 18 For/Because he_had_known that they_gave_ him _over because_of envy.

\v 20 But the chief_priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they_may_request the Barabbas and they_may_destroy the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 21 And the governor answering said to_them: Which are_you_all_wanting of the two, I_may_send_away to_you_all? And they said, the Barabbas.
\v 22 The Pilatos is_saying to_them: Therefore what may_I_do to_\nd Yaʸsous\nd*, who \add is\add* being_called \add the\add*_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*? All are_saying: ˓Let˒_him_be_executed_on_a_stake.

\v 46 And about the ninth hour, the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* shouted with_\add a\add*_ loud _voice saying: Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? This is: \nd god\nd* of_me, \nd god\nd* of_me, because/for_ why _reason you_abandoned me?
\v 47 And some of_the \add ones\add* having_stood there having_heard were_saying, that This \add man\add* is_calling Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*).
\v 48 And immediately one of them having_run and having_taken \add a\add*_sponge, and having_filled \add it\add* with_wine_vinegar and having_put_around \add it\add* around_\add a\add*_reed, was_giving_ him _to_drink.
\v 49 But the rest were_saying: Leave \add it\add*, we_may_see whether Aʸlias is_coming, going_to_save him.
\v 50 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* again having_cried_out with_\add a\add*_ loud _voice, sent_away his spirit.
\v 51 And see, the curtain of_the temple was_torn into two from top to bottom, and the earth was_shaken and the rocks were_divided,
\v 52 and the tombs were_opened_up and many bodies of_the holy \add ones\add* having_been_fallen_asleep was_raised, 
\v 53 and having_come_out out_of the tombs after the resurrection of_him, they_came_in into the holy city and were_manifested to_many.
\v 54 And the centurion and the \add ones\add* with him guarding the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, having_seen the earthquake and the \add things\add* having_become, were_ exceedingly _afraid saying: Truly this \add one\add* was son of_\nd god\nd*.
\v 55 And there were many women observing from afar, who followed the after_\nd Yaʸsous\nd* from the Galilaia/(Gālīl) serving unto_him,
\v 56 among whom was Maria/(Miryām) the from_Magdala, and Maria the mother of_ the _Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ) and of_Yōsaʸs/(Yōşēf?), and the mother of_the sons of_Zebedaios.
\v 57 And having_become evening, \add a\add*_ rich _man from Arimathaia came, namely Yōsaʸf/(Yōşēf), who also himself trained to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 58 This \add one\add* having_approached to_ the _Pilatos, requested the body of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd*. Then the Pilatos commanded \add it\add* to_be_given_back.
\v 59 And having_taken the body, the Yōsaʸf wrapped it in_\add a\add*_ clean _linen_cloth,
\v 60 and put it in the new tomb of_him which he_hewn in the rock, and having_rolled \add a\add*_ great _stone to_the door of_the tomb, he_went_away.
\v 61 And Maria the from_Magdala was there and the other Maria, sitting in_front_of the tomb.
\v 62 And on_the \add day\add* of_next, which is after the preparation \add day\add*, the chief_priests and the Farisaios_\add party\add* were_gathered_together to Pilatos
\v 63 saying: Master, we_were_reminded that that the deceiver still living said: I_am_being_raised after three days.
\v 64 Therefore command the tomb to_be_secured until the third day, lest the apprentices/followers having_come may_steal him and they_may_say to_the people: He_was_raised from the dead, and the last deception will_be worse \add than\add* the first.
\v 65 And the Pilatos was_saying to_them: You_all_are_having \add a\add*_guard, be_going secure \add it\add* as you_all_have_known.
\v 66 And they having_been_gone, secured the tomb, having_sealed the stone with the guard.

\v 1 And after \add the\add*_days_of_rest, at_the \add time\add* dawning toward \add the\add*_first \add day\add* of_\add the\add*_week, Maria/(Miryām) the from_Magdala and the other Maria came, to_observe the tomb.
\v 2 And see, \add an\add*_ great _earthquake became, because/for \add an\add*_messenger of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* having_come_down from heaven and having_approached, rolled_away the stone and was_sitting on it.
\v 3 And the appearance of_him was as lightning, and the clothing of_him white as snow.
\v 4 And the \add ones\add* guarding were_shaken from the fear of_him, and were_become as dead \add men\add*.
\v 5 And the messenger answering said to_the women: Be_ not _fearing you_all, because/for I_have_known that you_all_are_seeking \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, the \add one\add* having_been_executed_on_a_stake.
\v 6 He_is not here, because/for he_was_raised as he_said. Come see the place where he_was_lying.
\v 7 And having_been_gone quickly, say to_the apprentices/followers of_him that he_was_raised from the dead, and see, he_is_going_before you_all into the Galilaia/(Gālīl), you_all_will_be_seeing him there. Behold, I_told to_you_all.
\v 8 And having_gone_away quickly from the tomb, with fear and great joy, they_ran to_report to_the apprentices/followers of_him.
\v 9 And see, \nd Yaʸsous\nd* met with_them saying: Greetings. And the \add women\add* having_approached, took_hold_of the feet of_him and they_prostrated before_him.
\v 10 Then the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is_saying to_them: Be_ not _fearing. Be_going, report to_the brothers of_me that they_may_go_away into the Galilaia, and they_will_be_seeing me there.
\v 11 And them going, see, some of_the guard having_come into the city, reported to_the chief_priests all the \add things\add* having_become.
\v 12 And having_been_gathered_together with the elders, and having_taken counsel, they_gave many silver_coins to_the soldiers
\v 13 saying: Say that: The apprentices/followers of_him having_come by_night, stole him of_us falling_asleep.
\v 14 And if this may_be_heard by the governor, we will_be_persuading \add him\add* and we_will_be_making you_all unanxious.
\v 15 And having_taken \add the\add*_silver_coins, they did as they_were_taught. And the this message was_spread_abroad among \add the\add*_Youdaiōns until the today.
\v 16 But the \add the\add*_eleven apprentices/followers were_gone into the Galilaia/(Gālīl), to the mountain where the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* determined for_them.
\v 17 And having_seen him, they_prostrated, but they doubted.
\v 18 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_approached, spoke to_them saying: All authority in heaven and on earth was_given to_me.
\v 19 Therefore having_been_gone, train_followers all the nations, immersing them in the name of_the father, and of_the son, and of_the holy \nd spirit\nd*,
\v 20 teaching them to_be_keeping all \add things\add* as_much_as I_commanded to_you_all. And see, I am with you_all all the days, until the completion of_the age.
