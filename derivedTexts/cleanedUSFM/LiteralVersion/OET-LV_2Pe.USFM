\v 1 Simōn Petros, \add a\add*_slave and ambassador of_\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*, to_the \add ones\add* equal_valued with_us having_obtained \add a\add*_faith in \add the\add*_righteousness of_the \nd god\nd* of_us and saviour, \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd*:
\v 2 grace to_you_all and might_have_multiplied peace in \add the\add*_knowledge of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and of_\nd Yaʸsous\nd* the \nd master\nd* of_us.
\v 3 As having_granted all \add things\add* to_us of_the divine power of_him, the \add things\add* to life and devoutness, through the knowledge of_the \add one\add* having_called us, to_\add his\add*_own glory and virtue,
\v 4 through which has_granted his precious and greatest promises to_us, in_order_that through these \add things\add* you_all_may_become partners of_\add the\add*_divine nature, having_escaped_from from_the corruption in the \add the\add*_world by lust.
\v 5 Also same \add thing\add* and this earnestness all they_having_brought_in, supply in the faith of_you_all the virtue, and in the virtue the knowledge,
\v 6 and in the knowledge the self-control, and in the self-control the endurance, and in the endurance the devoutness,
\v 7 and in the devoutness the brotherly_love, and in the brotherly_love the love.
\v 8 For/Because these \add things\add* being and being_plentiful in_you_all, is_appointing neither idle nor unfruitful, because/for the knowledge of_the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 9 For/Because in_whomever these \add things\add* is_ not _being_present, is blind, being_near_sighted, having_received forgetfulness of_the purification the long_ago of_him sins.
\v 10 Therefore brothers rather, be_earnest, to_be_making the calling and choice of_you_all confirmed, because/for practicing these \add things\add* by_no_means you_all_may_ not _stumble once.
\v 11 For/Because thus the entrance into the eternal kingdom of_the \nd master\nd* of_us and saviour, \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd* will_be_being_ richly _supplied to_you_all.
\v 12 Therefore I_will_be_going always to_be_reminding you_all concerning these \add things\add*, although having_perceived \add them\add* and having_been_strengthened in the being_present truth.
\v 13 And I_am_considering \add it\add* right for as_long_as I_am in this the tent, to_be_awaking you_all by \add the\add*_remembrance,
\v 14 having_known that the removal of_the tent of_me is imminent, as also the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd*, made_evident to_me.
\v 15 And I_will_be_being_earnest also each_time to_be_having you_all to_be_making \add a\add*_remembrance of_these \add things\add* after the my departure, which.
\v 16 For/Because we_made_known to_you_all the power and coming of_the \nd master\nd* of_us \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd* not having_followed_after having_been_cleverly_devised myths, but having_been_become eyewitnesses of_the greatness of_that \add one\add*.
\v 17 For/Because having_received honour and glory from \nd god\nd* \add the\add*_father, \add a\add*_voice such_as_this having_been_brought to_him by the Majestic Glory: This is The son of_me, the beloved in whom I took_pleasure, 
\v 18 and we heard this the voice from heaven, having_been_brought with him, being on the holy mountain.
\v 19 And we_are_having the prophetic message more_confirmed, to_which you_all_are_doing well taking_heed, as to_\add a\add*_lamp shining in \add a\add*_dark place, until of_which day may_shining_through, and \add the\add*_morning_star may_rise in the hearts of_you_all.
\v 20 Knowing this first, that any prophecy of_scripture of_\add its\add*_own interpretation is_ not _becoming.
\v 21 For/Because was_ not once _brought by_\add the\add*_will of_\add a\add*_human prophecy, but people being_carried by \add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*, spoke \add the\add*_holy from of_\nd god\nd*.

\v 1 But false_prophets also became among the people, as also among you_all will_be false_teachers, who will_be_sneaking_in sects of_destruction, even disowning the master having_bought them, bringing_upon upon_themselves quick destruction.
\v 2 And many will_be_following_after of_them in_the wantonnesses, because_of whom the way of_the truth will_be_being_slandered.
\v 3 And in greediness they_will_be_merchandising you_all with_fabricated messages, for_whom the judgement anciently is_ not _idling, and the destruction of_them is_ not _nodding_off.
\v 4 For/Because if the \nd god\nd* not spared of_\add the\add*_messengers having_sinned, but having_committed_to_\add the\add*_underworld \add them\add* to_pits of_darkness, gave_over \add them\add* for judgement being_kept,
\v 5 and he_ not _spared from_\add the\add*_ancient world, but preserved \add the\add*_eighth, Nōe/(Noaḩ), \add a\add*_proclaimer of_righteousness, having_brought_ \add the\add*_flood _upon upon_\add the\add*_world of_\add the\add*_ungodly,
\v 6 and having_reduced_to_ashes \add the\add*_cities of_Sodoma/(Şədom) and Gomorra/(ˊAmorāh) condemned \add them\add*, having_presented \add an\add*_example of_going to_be_acting_ungodly
\v 7 and rescued righteous Lōt/(Lōţ), being_distressed by the of_conduct of_the lawless in wantonness
\v 8 (for the righteous \add man\add* dwelling among them in_seeing and in_hearing, day by day, was_tormenting in_\add his\add*_ righteous _soul with_\add their\add*_lawless works), 
\v 9 \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* has_known to_be_rescuing \add the\add*_devout \add ones\add* out_of temptation, but to_be_keeping \add the\add*_unrighteous \add ones\add* to being_punished \add the\add*_day of_judgement,
\v 10 and most_of_all the \add ones\add* pursuing after \add the\add*_flesh in \add the\add*_lusts of_defilement, and despising of_mastership. Darers self-willed, they_are_ not _trembling slandering at_glories,
\v 11 where messengers being greater in_strength and power, are_ not _bringing \add a\add*_slanderous judgement against them before \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*.
\v 12 But these like illogical animals, having_been_born natural for capture and corruption, slandering in what \add things\add* they_are_not_knowing, in the corruption of_them and they_will_be_being_corrupted,
\v 13 being_done_wrong as_\add the\add*_wage of_unrighteousness, as_gratification considering the luxury in \add the\add*_day, stains and blemishes reveling in the seductions of_them, feasting_with with_you_all,
\v 14 having eyes full of_adulteress, and unceasing from_sin, enticing unstable souls, having \add a\add*_heart having_been_trained in_greediness, children of_\add a\add*_curse,
\v 15 having_left \add the\add*_straight way, they_were_strayed having_followed_after in_the way of_ the _Balaʼam/(Bilˊām) of_ the _Bosor/(Bəˊōr), who loved \add the\add*_wage of_unrighteousness,
\v 16 but he_had \add a\add*_rebuke for_\add his\add*_own lawlessness, \add a\add*_ silent _donkey having_spoken in of_\add a\add*_human \add a\add*_voice, because/forbade the insanity of_the prophet.
\v 17 These are waterless springs, and mists being_driven by storm, for_whom the darkness of_ the _darkness has_been_kept.
\v 18 For/Because speaking arrogant \add messages\add* of_uselessness, they_are_enticing with \add the\add*_lusts of_\add the\add*_flesh to_wantonness, the \add ones\add* barely escaping_from the \add ones\add* being_conducted in deception,
\v 19 promising freedom to_them, they being to_slaves of_ the _corruption, because/for by_what anyone has_been_overcome, by_this \add one\add* he_has_been_enslaved.
\v 20 For/Because if having_escaped_from the defilements of_the world, in \add the\add*_knowledge of_the \nd master\nd* and saviour \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*, and having_ again _˓been˒_entangled in_these \add things\add* they_have_been_overcome, the last has_become to_them worse \add than\add* the first.
\v 21 For/Because it_was better, for_them, not to_have_known the way of_ the _righteousness, than having_known \add it\add*, to_turn_away from the holy command having_been_given_over to_them.
\v 22 the \add message\add* of_the true proverb has_happened to_them: \add A\add*_dog having_returned to its own vomit, and: \add A\add*_sow having_washed, to wallowing in_\add the\add*_mud.

\v 1 Beloved this \add is\add* now, \add the\add*_second letter I_am_writing to_you_all, in which I_am_awaking the sincere mind of_you_all in remembrance,
\v 2 to_be_reminded of_the messages having_been_previously_spoken, by the holy prophets, and of_the command of_the \nd master\nd* and saviour of_the ambassadors of_you_all.
\v 3 Knowing this first, that mockers will_be_coming in \add the\add*_last of_the days with mocking, pursuing according_to their own lusts of_them,
\v 4 and saying: Where is the promise of_the coming of_him? From for that \add time\add* the fathers were_fallen_asleep, all \add things\add* is_continuing thus from \add the\add*_beginning of_creation.
\v 5 For/Because this is_escaping_notice them willing, that \add the\add*_heavens were anciently, and \add the\add*_earth having_consisted out_of water and through water by_the message of_ the _\nd god\nd*,
\v 6 through which the then world perished having_been_flooded in_water.
\v 7 But the now heavens and the earth, by_the same message are having_been_stored_up, for_fire being_kept to \add the\add*_day of_judgement and destruction of_ the _ungodly people.
\v 8 But let_ this _be_escaping_notice one not you_all, beloved, that one day with \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* \add is\add* like \add a\add*_thousand years and \add a\add*_thousand, years \add are\add* like one day.
\v 9 \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* is_ not _slowing of_his promise, as some are_considering slowness, but he_is_being_patient toward you_all, not wishing any to_perish, but all to to_accept repentance.
\v 10 But \add the\add*_day of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* will_be_coming like \add a\add*_thief, in which the heavens will_be_passing_away vociferously, and elements being_burned will_be_being_destroyed, and \add the\add*_earth and the works in it will_be_being_found.
\v 11 all these \add things\add* thus being_destroyed, what_kind_of \add people\add* it_is_fitting you_all to_be_being in holy conduct and devoutness,
\v 12 expecting and hurrying the coming of_the day of_ the _\nd god\nd*, because_of which \add the\add*_heavens being_burned, will_be_being_destroyed, and \add the\add*_elements being_burned, is_being_melted.
\v 13 But we_are_waiting for_new heavens and \add a\add*_new earth, according_to the promise of_him, in which righteousness is_dwelling.
\v 14 Therefore, beloved, expecting these \add things\add*, be_earnest spotless and blameless to_be_found by_him in peace.
\v 15 And be_considering the patience of_the \nd master\nd* of_us, salvation, as also the beloved of_us brother Paulos, according_to the wisdom having_been_given to_him, wrote to_you_all,
\v 16 as also in all letters, speaking in them concerning these \add things\add*, among which is hard_to_understand \add things\add* some, which the ignorant and unstable are_twisting as also the other scriptures, to their own destruction of_them.
\v 17 Therefore you_all, beloved, knowing_before be_guarding, in_order_that you_all_may_ not _fall_from from_your own steadfastness having_been_carried_away with_the deception of_the lawless.
\v 18 But be_growing in grace, and in_\add the\add*_knowledge of_the \nd master\nd* and saviour of_us, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*. To_him \add be\add* the glory both now and to \add the\add*_day of_eternity. Truly.
