\v 1 Since many attempted to_draw_up \add a\add*_description concerning the matters having_been_fully_assured among us,
\v 2 as the \add ones\add* from \add the\add*_beginning, having_become eyewitnesses and attendants of_the message, gave_ \add them\add* _over to_us,
\v 3 it_supposed to_also_me having_followed originally with_all \add things\add* exactly, to_write to_you consecutively, most_excellent Theofilos,
\v 4 in_order_that you_may_know the certainty concerning which of_\add the\add*_messages you_were_instructed.
\v 5 It_became in the days of_Haʸrōdaʸs king of_ the _Youdaia, \add a\add*_ certain _priest by_\add the\add*_name Zaⱪarias of division of_Abia/(ʼAⱱīāh), and wife to_him of the daughters of_Aʼarōn/(ʼAhₐron), and the name of_her, Elisabet.
\v 6 And they_were both righteous before the \nd god\nd*, blameless in pursuing all the commands and just_acts of_the \nd master\nd*.
\v 7 And was to_them no child, as_much_as the Elisabet was barren, and both were having_advanced in the days of_them.
\v 8 And it_became in the \add time\add* him to_be_ministering, before the \nd god\nd* in the order of_the division of_him,
\v 9 according_to the custom of_the priestly_office, he_was_chosen_by_lot which to_burn_incense, having_come_in into the temple of_the \nd master\nd*.
\v 10 And all the multitude of_the people was praying outside at_the hour of_the incense.
\v 11 And \add an\add*_messenger of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* was_seen to_him, having_stood on \add the\add*_right of_the altar of_the incense.
\v 12 And Zaⱪarias was_disturbed having_seen \add him\add*, and fear fell_on on him.
\v 13 But the messenger said to him: Be_ not _fearing, Zaⱪarias, because the petition of_you was_listened_to, and Elisabet the wife of_you will_be_bearing \add a\add*_son to_you, and you_will_be_calling the name of_him Yōannaʸs.
\v 14 And will_be joy and exultation to_you, and many will_be_being_elated at the birth of_him.
\v 15 For/Because he_will_be great before the \nd master\nd*, and by_no_means he_may_ not _drink wine and liquor, and he_will_be_being_filled of_\add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd* still from \add the\add*_womb of_\add the\add*_mother of_him.
\v 16 And he_will_be_turning_back many of_the sons of_Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*) to \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, the \nd god\nd* of_them.
\v 17 And he will_be_going_ahead before him in \add the\add*_spirit and power with_Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*), to_turn_back \add the\add*_hearts of_\add the\add*_fathers to \add the\add*_children, and \add the\add*_unpersuadable in \add the\add*_understanding of_\add the\add*_righteous, to_prepare for_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* \add a\add*_people having_been_prepared.
\v 18 And Zaⱪarias said to the messenger: By what ˓will˒_I_be_knowing this? For/Because I am \add an\add*_older_man, and the wife of_me having_advanced in the days of_her.
\v 19 And answering the messenger said to_him: I am Gabriaʸl/(Gaⱱrī\sup ʼēl\sup*), the \add one\add* having_stood_by before the \nd god\nd*, and I_was_sent_out to_speak to you, and to_good_message_preach these \add things\add* to_you.
\v 20 And see, you_will_be keeping_silent and not being_able to_speak, until that day these \add things\add* may_become, because/for that you_ not _believed in_the messages of_me, which will_be_being_fulfilled in the season of_them.
\v 21 And the people was expecting the Zaⱪarias, and they_were_marvelling at the \add time\add* to_be_delaying him in the temple.
\v 22 But having_come_out he_was_ not _able to_speak to_them, and they_recognized that he_has_seen \add a\add*_vision in the temple. And he was nodding to_them, and was_continuing mute.
\v 23 And it_became when the days of_the ministry of_him were_fulfilled, he_went_away to the home of_him.
\v 24 And after these the days Elisabet the wife of_him conceived, and was_secluding herself five months saying,
\v 25 that Thus \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* has_done to_me, in \add the\add*_days in_which he_looked_upon, to_take_away \add the\add*_disgrace of_me among people.

\v 28 And having_come_in the messenger to her, said: Greetings, having_been_favoured. The \nd master\nd* \add is\add* with you.
\v 29 And she was_thoroughly_perplexed at the statement, and was_reasoning what_kind_of the greeting this might_be.
\v 30 And the messenger said to_her: Be_ not _fearing, Maria, because/for you_found favour with the \nd god\nd*.
\v 31 And see, you_will_be_conceiving in your_womb, and you_will_be_bearing \add a\add*_son, and you_will_be_calling the name of_him \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 32 This \add one\add* will_be great, and will_be_being_called \add the\add*_son of_\add the\add*_highest, and \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* the \nd god\nd* will_be_giving to_him the throne of_Dawid, the father of_him,
\v 33 and he_will_be_reigning over the house of_Yakōb/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), to the ages, and of_the kingdom of_him, will_ not _be \add an\add*_end.
\v 34 And said Maria to the messenger: How will_ this _be, because I_am_ not _knowing \add a\add*_man?
\v 35 And answering the messenger said to_her: \add The\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd* will_be_coming_over on you, and \add the\add*_power of_\add the\add*_highest will_be_overshadowing on_you, therefore also the holy \add child\add* being_born will_be_being_called, son of_\nd god\nd*.

\v 37 Because every message ˓will˒_ not _be_unattaining with the \nd god\nd*.
\v 38 And Maria/(Miryām) said: Behold, the handmaiden of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, might_it_become to_me according_to the message of_you. And the messenger went_away from her.
\v 39 And Maria having_risen_up in the these days, was_gone into the mountainous with earnestness, to \add a\add*_city of_Youda/(Yəhūdāh),
\v 40 and she_came_in into the house of_Zaⱪarias, and greeted the Elisabet.
\v 41 And it_became, as the Elisabet heard the greeting of_ the _Maria, the baby kicked in the womb of_her, and the Elisabet was_filled with_\add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*,
\v 42 and she_cried_out with_\add a\add*_ loud _voice and said: You having_been_blessed among women, and the fruit of_the womb of_you having_been_blessed.
\v 43 And from_where this to_me, that the mother of_the \nd master\nd* of_me may_come to me?

\v 45 And blessed \add is\add* the \add woman\add* having_believed that there_will_be \add a\add*_completion to_the \add things\add* having_been_spoken to_her from \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*.
\v 46 And Maria said: The soul of_me is_magnifying the \nd master\nd*,
\v 47 and the spirit of_me exulted in the \nd god\nd*, the saviour of_me.
\v 48 Because he_looked_at on the humiliation of_the handmaiden of_him. For/Because see, from the \add time\add* now all the generations will_be_counting_ me _blessed.
\v 49 Because the powerful \add one\add* did great \add things\add* to_me, and the name of_him \add is\add* holy.
\v 50 And the mercy of_him \add is\add* to generations and generations, to_the \add ones\add* revering him.
\v 51 He_did power with \add the\add*_arm of_him, \add the\add*_proud in_\add the\add*_mind of_heart of_them he_scattered.

\v 59 And it_became on the the eighth day, they_came to_circumcise the little_child, and they_were_calling it Zaⱪarias after the name of_the father of_him.
\v 60 And having_been_answering the mother of_him said: No, but he_will_be_being_called Yōannaʸs.
\v 61 And they_said to her, that No_one is of the relatives of_you, who is_being_called the by_ this _name.
\v 62 And they_were_signaling to_the father of_him, what the \add name\add* wishfully he_might_be_wanting him to_be_being_called.
\v 63 And having_requested \add a\add*_tablet, he_wrote saying: Yōannaʸs is \add the\add*_name of_him. And all marvelled.

\v 7 Therefore he_was_saying to_the crowds going_out to_be_immersed by him: Brood of_vipers, who warned to_you_all to_flee from the coming severe_anger?
\v 8 Therefore produce fruits worthy of_ the _repentance, and you_all_may_ not _begin to_be_saying in yourselves, we_are_having the Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām) As_father, because/for I_am_saying to_you_all that the \nd god\nd* is_able to_raise children to_ the _Abraʼam from the these stones.

\v 15 And the people expecting and reasoning all in the hearts of_them concerning the Yōannaʸs, whether he might_be the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*,
\v 16 the Yōannaʸs answered saying to_all: I on_one_hand am_immersing you_all in_water, on_the_other_hand the \add one\add* mightier \add than\add* me is_coming, of_whom not I_am worthy to_untie the strap of_the sandals of_him, he will_be_immersing you_all in \add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd*, and with_fire,

\v 3 And the devil said to_him: If you_are \add the\add*_son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, say the to_ this _stone that it_may_become bread.
\v 4 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answered to him: It_has_been_written, that the person only Not on bread will_be_living.
\v 5 And having_brought_ him _up he_showed to_him all the kingdoms of_the inhabited_world in \add a\add*_moment of_time.
\v 6 And the devil said to_him: I_will_be_giving to_you the all this domain and the glory of_them, because has_been_given_over to_me and I_am_giving it to_whom if I_may_be_wanting.
\v 7 Therefore if you you_may_prostrate before me, everyone will_be of_you.

\v 9 And he_led him to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and stood on the pinnacle of_the temple, and he_said to_him: If you_are \add the\add*_son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, throw yourself down from_here,

\v 13 And having_completed every temptation, the devil withdrew from him until \add a\add*_season.

\v 15 And he was_teaching in the synagogues of_them, being_glorified by all.
\v 16 And he_came to Nazaret, where he_was having_been_brought_up, and he_came_in according_to that having_been_accustomed to_him, on the day of_the days_of_rest into the synagogue, and he_stood_up to_read.
\v 17 And \add the\add*_scroll of_the prophet Aʸsaias/(Yəshaˊ\sup yāh\sup*) was_handed_out to_him, and having_opened_up the scroll, he_found the place where it_was having_been_written,

\v 20 And having_rolled_up the scroll having_given_back \add it\add* to_the attendant, he_sat_down and the eyes of_all in the synagogue were looking_intently at_him.
\v 21 And he_began to_be_saying to them, that Today this the scripture has_been_fulfilled in the ears of_you_all.
\v 22 And all were_testifying to_him, and were_marvelling at the messages of_ the _grace which going_out out_of the mouth of_him, and they_were_saying, is this Not \add the\add*_son of_Yōsaʸf/(Yōşēf)?
\v 23 And he_said to them: Certainly you_all_will_be_saying to_me the this parable: Physician, heal yourself, as_much_as we_heard having_become in the Kafarnaʼoum, also do here in the hometown of_you.
\v 24 And he_said: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that not_one prophet is acceptable in the hometown of_him.
\v 25 But in truth I_am_saying to_you_all, were many widows in the days of_Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*) in the Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*), when the sky was_shut for three years and six months when \add a\add*_ great _famine became on all the land,

\v 28 And all in the synagogue were_filled with_rage hearing these \add things\add*,
\v 29 and having_risen_up, they_throw_out him out of_the city, and they_led him to \add the\add*_brow of_the mountain on which the city of_them had_been_built, so_as to_throw_ him _down.
\v 30 But he, having_passed_through through \add the\add*_midst of_them, was_going.
\v 31 And he_came_down to Kafarnaʼoum, \add a\add*_city of_ the _Galilaia/(Gālīl). And he_was teaching them on the days_of_rest.
\v 32 And they_were_being_astonished at the teaching of_him, because the message of_him was with authority.
\v 33 And in the synagogue was \add a\add*_man having \add a\add*_spirit of_\add a\add*_ unclean _demon, and he_cried_out with_\add a\add*_ loud _voice,
\v 34 Ha. What to_us and to_you, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* Nazaraʸnos? Came_you to_destroy us? I_have_known who you are, the holy \add one\add* of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 35 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* gave_rebuke to_it saying: Be_silenced, and come_out from him. And the demon having_thrown_ him _down into the midst, came_out from him, nothing having_harmed him.
\v 36 And amazement became on all, and they_were_conversing_with to one_another saying: What \add is\add* the this message, that with authority and power he_is_commanding to_the unclean spirits, and they_are_coming_out?
\v 37 And \add the\add*_report concerning him was_going_out into every place of_the surrounding_region.
\v 38 And from the synagogue having_risen_up, he_came_in into the house of_Simōn. And \add the\add*_mother_in_law of_ the _Simōn was being_gripped_with with_\add a\add*_ great _fever, and they_asked to_him about her.
\v 39 And having_stood_by over her, he_gave_rebuke to_the fever, and it_left her, and immediately having_stood_up, she_was_serving unto_them.
\v 40 And at_\add the\add*_setting of_the sun, all as_many_as were_having ailing \add ones\add* with_ various _diseases, they_brought them to him, and he laying_on his hands to_one each of_them, was_healing them.
\v 41 And also demons was_coming_out from many, crying_out and saying, that You are the son of_ the _\nd god\nd*. But giving_rebuke, he_was_ not _allowing them to_be_speaking, because they_had_known him to_be the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 42 And having_become day, having_come_out he_was_gone into \add a\add*_desolate place, and the crowds were_seeking_after him, and they_came up_to him, and they_were_restraining him which to_ not _be_going from them.
\v 43 But he said to them, that it_is_fitting me also to_good_message_preach the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* to_the other cities, because I_was_sent_out for this.
\v 44 And he_was proclaiming in the synagogues the of_Youdaia.
\c 5
\v 1 And it_became at the \add time\add*, the crowd to_be_imposing on_him and to_be_hearing the message of_the \nd god\nd*, and he was having_stood by the lake of_Gennaʸsaret,
\v 2 and he_saw two boats having_stopped by the lake, but the fishermen from them having_gone_out, were_washing the nets.
\v 3 And having_boarded into one of_the boats, which was of_Simōn, he_asked him to_set_out little from the land. And having_sat_down, he_was_teaching the crowds from the boat.
\v 4 And when he_ceased speaking, he_said to the Simōn: Set_out into the depth and lower the nets of_you_all for \add a\add*_catch.
\v 5 And Simōn answering, said: Master, through all night having_laboured, nothing we_took, but at the message of_you, I_will_be_lowering the nets.
\v 6 And this having_done, they_caught \add a\add*_ great _multitude of_fishes, and the nets of_them was_being_torn.
\v 7 And they_signaled to_the companions in the other boat, which having_come to_give_help to_them, and they_came, and they_filled both the boats, so_that them to_be_being_sunk.
\v 8 But Simōn Petros having_seen fell_before to_the knees of_\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* saying: Come_out from me, because I_am \add a\add*_man sinful, \nd master\nd*.
\v 9 For/Because amazement seized him and all the \add ones\add* with him, at the catch of_the fishes which they_captured,
\v 10 and also Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ) and Yōannaʸs, sons of_Zebedaios, who likewise were partners the with_Simōn. And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to the Simōn: Be_ not _fearing, from the \add time\add* now you_will_be catching people.
\v 11 And having_brought_down the boats to the land, having_left all \add things\add*, they_followed after_him.
\v 12 And it_became in that him to_be in one of_the cities, and see, \add a\add*_man full of_leprosy, and having_seen the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, having_fallen on \add his\add*_face, he_was_besought of_him saying: \nd master\nd*, if you_may_be_willing, you_are_being_able to_cleanse me.
\v 13 And having_stretched_out his hand, he_touched against_him saying: I_am_willing, be_cleansed. And immediately the leprosy went_away from him.
\v 14 And he commanded to_him: To_tell no_one, but having_gone_away show yourself to_the priest, and offer as the cleansing of_you as Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) commanded, as \add a\add*_testimony to_them.
\v 15 But the message concerning him was_passing_through more, and great crowds were_coming_together to_be_hearing, and to_be_being_healed from the sicknesses of_them.
\v 16 But he was withdrawing in the wildernesss and praying.
\v 17 And it_became on one of_the days, and he was teaching, and Farisaios_\add party\add* and law_teachers were sitting, who they_were having_come out_of every village of_ the _Galilaia/(Gālīl), and of_Youdaia, and of_Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim). And \add the\add*_power of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd* was \add there\add* in_order that him to_be_healing.
\v 18 And see, men carrying \add a\add*_man on \add a\add*_bed who was having_been_paralyzed, and they_were_seeking to_carry_ him _in and to_put before him.
\v 19 And not having_found by_what \add way\add* they_may_carry_ him _in because_of the crowd, having_gone_up on the housetop, they_let_ him _down through the tiles with the stretcher into the midst before the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 20 And having_seen the faith of_them he_said: Man, the sins of_you have_been_forgiven to_you.
\v 21 And the scribes and the Farisaios_\add party\add* began to_be_reasoning saying: Who is this who is_speaking slander? Who is_able to_be_forgiving sins except not/lest only the \nd god\nd*?
\v 22 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_known the speculations of_them, answering said to them: Why you_all_are_reasoning in the hearts of_you_all?
\v 23 Which is easier, to_say, the sins of_you ˓Have_been_forgiven to_you, or to_say: Be_raising and be_walking?
\v 24 But in_order_that you_all_may_have_known that the son of_ the _man is_having authority on the earth to_be_forgiving sins, he_said to_the \add one\add* having_been_paralyzed: to_you I_am_saying, be_raising, and having_taken_up the stretcher of_you, be_going to the house of_you.
\v 25 And immediately having_stood_up before them, having_taken_up on which he_was_lying, he_went_away to the home of_him glorifying the \nd god\nd*.
\v 26 And amazement took all, and they_were_glorifying the \nd god\nd*, and they_were_filled with_fear saying, that We_saw remarkable \add things\add* today.
\v 27 And after these \add things\add* he_came_out, and saw \add a\add*_tax_collector with_\add the\add*_name Leui/(Lēvī), sitting at the tax_office, and he_said to_him: Be_following after_me.
\v 28 And having_left all \add things\add*, having_risen_up he_was_following after_him.
\v 29 And Leui/(Lēvī) made \add a\add*_ great _banquet for_him in the house of_him, and there_was \add a\add*_ great _crowd of_tax_collectors and others, who were reclining with them.
\v 30 And the Farisaios_\add party\add* and the scribes of_them were_grumbling at the apprentices/followers of_him saying: for_ Why _reason you_all_are_eating and you_all_are_drinking with the tax_collectors and sinners?
\v 31 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answering said to them: The \add ones\add* being_healthy are_ not _having need of_\add a\add*_doctor, but the \add ones\add* being sickly.
\v 32 I_have_ not _come to_call \add the\add*_righteous, but sinners to repentance.
\v 33 And they said to him: The apprentices/followers of_Yōannaʸs are_fasting frequently, and they_are_making petitions, likewise also the \add ones\add* of_the Farisaios_\add party\add*, but the \add ones\add* to_yours are_eating and are_drinking.
\v 34 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to them: You_all_are_ not _being_able to_make the sons of_the bridal_chamber in which the bridegroom is with them to_be_fasting?
\v 35 But days will_be_ also _coming whenever the bridegroom may_be_taken_away from them, then they_will_be_fasting in those the days.
\v 36 And he_was_ also _speaking \add a\add*_parable to them: that No_one having_torn \add a\add*_patch of \add a\add*_ new _garment, is_putting_on \add it\add* on \add a\add*_ old _garment, but if not surely both the new will_be_tearing, and the patch which of the new not will_be_agreeing_together with_the old.
\v 37 And no_one is_putting new wine into old wineskins, and if not surely the the new wine will_be_bursting the wineskins, and it will_be_being_poured_out, and the wineskins will_be_destroying \add it\add*.
\v 38 But new wine placeable \add is\add*. into new wineskins.
\v 39 No_one having_drunk \add the\add*_old is_wanting \add the\add*_new, because/for he_is_saying: The old is good.

\v 1 And it_became on \add the\add*_day_of_rest him to_be_passing_through through grainfields, and the apprentices/followers of_him were_plucking, and were_eating the heads_of_grain, rubbing \add them\add* in_their hands.
\v 2 But some of_the Farisaios_\add party\add* said: Why you_all_are_doing what is_ not _permitting on_the days_of_rest?
\v 3 And answering to them the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said: You_all_ not_even _read this, what Dawid/(Dāvid) did when he and the \add ones\add* with him hungered?
\v 4 how he_came_in into the house of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and having_taken the bread of_the presence, he_ate and gave to_the \add ones\add* with him, which not is_permitting to_eat, except not/lest only the priests?
\v 5 And he_was_saying to_them: The son of_ the _man is \nd master\nd* of_the day_of_rest.
\v 6 And it_became on another day_of_rest, him to_come_in into the synagogue and to_be_teaching, and \add a\add*_man was there, and the the right hand of_him was withered.
\v 7 And the scribes and the Farisaios_\add party\add* were_watching_ him _closely, whether he_will_be_healing on the day_of_rest, in_order_that they_may_find to_be_accusing against_him.
\v 8 But he he_had_known the speculations of_them, and said to_the man the hand being which withered: Be_raising, and stand in the midst. And having_risen_up, he_stood.
\v 9 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said, to them: I_am_asking you_all, whether it_is_permitting on_the day_of_rest to_do_good or to_do_evil, to_save life or to_destroy?
\v 10 And having_looked_around at_all them, he_said to_him: Stretch_out the hand of_you. And he he_did, and the hand of_him. was_restored.
\v 11 But they were_filled with_folly, and were_discussing with one_another what wishfully they_might_do to_ the _\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 12 And it_became in the these days, him to_come_out on the mountain to_pray, and he_was spending_the_night in the prayer the to_\nd god\nd*.
\v 13 And when it_became day, he_calling_out the apprentices/followers of_him, and having_chosen twelve from them, whom also ˓he˒_named ambassadors:

\v 16 and Youdas/(Yəhūdāh) of_Yakōbos, and Youdas Iskariōtaʸs, who became \add the\add*_betrayer.
\v 17 And having_come_down with them, he_stood on \add a\add*_ level _place, and \add a\add*_ great _crowd of_apprentices/followers of_him, and \add a\add*_ great _multitude of_the people from all the Youdaia, and Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and the coastal \add area\add* of_Turos/(Tsor) and Sidōn/(Tsīdōn),

\v 19 And all the crowd were_seeking to_be_touching against_him, because power was_coming_out from him and he_was_healing all.
\v 20 And he having_lifted_up the eyes of_him on the apprentices/followers of_him was_saying: Blessed \add are\add* the poor, because the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* is yours.
\v 21 Blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* hungering now, because you_all_will_be_being_satisfied. Blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* weeping now, because you_all_will_be_laughing.
\v 22 Blessed are_you_all whenever the people may_hate you_all, and whenever they_may_set_ you_all _apart, and they_may_deride \add you\add*, and may_throw_out the name of_you_all as evil, on_account of_the son of_ the _Man.
\v 23 Be_elated in that the day, and jump \add for_joy\add*, because/for see, the reward of_you_all \add is\add* great in the heaven. The in for same \add way\add* the fathers of_them were_doing to_the prophets.
\v 24 However woe to_you_all the rich, because you_all_are_receiving_fully the comfort of_you_all.
\v 25 Woe to_you_all, you_all having_been_filled now, because you_all_will_be_hungering. Woe, to_you_all laughing now, because you_all_will_be_mourning and you_all_will_be_weeping.
\v 26 Woe \add to_you\add* whenever all the people may_speak well you_all, the in for same \add way\add* were_doing to_the false_prophets the fathers of_them.
\v 27 But I_am_saying to_you_all to_the \add ones\add* hearing, be_loving the enemies of_you_all, be_doing well to_the \add ones\add* hating you_all,
\v 28 be_blessing the \add ones\add* cursing you_all, be_praying for the \add ones\add* mistreating you_all.
\v 29 To_the \add one\add* striking you on the cheek, be_bringing_about also the other, and from the \add one\add* taking_away the \add the\add*_coat of_you, also you_may_ not _forbid the tunic.
\v 30 Be_giving to_everyone requesting you, and be_ not _demanding_back \add it\add* from the \add one\add* taking_away the your \add things\add*.
\v 31 And as you_all_are_wanting that the people may_be_doing to_you_all, be_doing likewise to_them.
\v 32 And if you_all_are_loving the \add ones\add* loving you_all, what grace it_is to_you_all? For/Because even the sinners are_loving the \add ones\add* loving them.
\v 33 For/Because also if you_all_may_be_doing_good the \add ones\add* doing_good to_you_all, what grace is_it to_you_all? Even the sinners are_doing the same.
\v 34 And if you_all_may_lend from whom you_all_are_hoping to_receive, what grace to_you_all it_is? Even sinners are_lending to_sinners, in_order_that they_may_receive_back the same \add amounts\add*.
\v 35 However be_loving the enemies of_you_all, and be_doing_good, and be_lending expecting_ nothing _back, and the reward of_you_all will_be great, and you_all_will_be sons of_\add the\add*_highest, because he is good to the ungrateful and evil.
\v 36 Be_becoming compassionate, as the father of_you_all is compassionate.
\v 37 And be_ not _judging, and by_no_means you_all_may_ not _be_judged. And be_ not _convicting, and by_no_means you_all_may_ not _be_convicted. Be_sending_away, and you_all_will_be_being_sent_away.

\v 39 And he_ also _spoke \add a\add*_parable to_them: Surely_not \add a\add*_blind \add one\add* is_able to_be_guiding \add a\add*_blind \add one\add*? ˓Will˒_ not _be_falling both into \add a\add*_pit?
\v 40 \add A\add*_apprentice/follower is not above the teacher, but everyone having_been_prepared will_be as the teacher of_him.

\v 42 How are_you_being_able to_be_saying to_the brother of_you: Brother, allow I_may_throw_out the speck which in the eye of_you, not seeing yourself the beam in the eye of_you?

\v 43 For/Because there_is not good tree producing bad fruit, nor again \add a\add*_ bad _tree producing good fruit.

\v 45 The good person is_bringing_forth the good out_of the good treasure of_the heart of_him, and the evil \add person\add* is_bringing_forth the evil out_of the evil. For/Because the mouth of_him is_speaking out_of. \add the\add*_excess. of_\add the\add*_heart.
\v 46 And why are_you_all_calling me \nd master\nd*, \nd master\nd*, and you_all_are_ not _doing what I_am_saying?
\v 47 Everyone who coming to me, and hearing of_the messages of_me and doing them, I_will_be_showing to_you_all to_whom he_is similar:

\v 1 After he_fulfilled all the messages of_him in the hearing of_the people, he_came_in into Kafarnaʼoum.
\v 2 And certain slave of_\add a\add*_centurion being sickly, was_going to_be_dying, who was honoured to_him.
\v 3 And having_heard about the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, he_sent_out elders of_the Youdaiōns to him, asking him so_that having_come he_may_cure the slave of_him.
\v 4 And the \add ones\add* having_arrived to the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, were_imploring him earnestly saying that He_is worthy to_whom you_will_be_bringing_about this,
\v 5 for/because he_is_loving the nation of_us, and he built the synagogue for/because_us.
\v 6 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* he_was_going with them. And already of_him being_ not far _away from the house, the centurion sent friends saying to_him: \nd master\nd*, be_ not _being_troubled, because/for not worthy I_am that you_may_come_in under the roof of_me, 
\v 7 therefore I_considered_worthy not_even myself to_come to you, but say by_\add a\add*_message, and let_be_healed the servant of_me.
\v 8 For/Because also I am \add a\add*_man being_appointed under authority, having soldiers under myself, and I_am_saying to_this \add one\add*: Be_gone, and he_is_going, and to_other: Be_coming, and he_is_coming, and to_the slave of_me: Do this, and he_is_doing \add it\add*.
\v 9 And having_heard these \add things\add* the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, marvelled at_him, and having_been_turned to_the crowd following after_him said: I_am_saying to_you_all, not_even in the Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*) I_found so_much faith.
\v 10 And the \add ones\add* having_been_sent having_returned to the house, found the slave being_healthy.
\v 11 And it_became on on_the_ next _\add day\add*, he_was_gone into \add a\add*_city being_called Nain, and the apprentices/followers of_him and \add a\add*_ great _crowd were_going_with with_him.
\v 12 And as he_neared to_the gate of_the city, and see \add an\add*_only_begotten son to_the mother of_him was_being_carried_out having_died, and she was \add a\add*_widow, and \add a\add*_ sizeable _crowd of_the city was with her.
\v 13 And having_seen her, the \nd master\nd* was_feeling_compassion on her, and said to_her: Be_ not _weeping.
\v 14 And having_approached, he_touched against_the coffin, and the \add ones\add* bearing \add it\add* stopped, and he_said: Young_man, I_am_saying to_you: Be_raised. 
\v 15 And the dead \add man\add* sat_up and began to_be_speaking, and he_gave him to_the mother of_him.
\v 16 And all took fear, and they_were_glorifying the \nd god\nd* saying, that \add A\add*_ great _prophet was_raised among us. And, that - \nd god\nd* visited the people of_him. 
\v 17 And the this message came_out in all the Youdaia concerning him, and all the surrounding_region.
\v 18 And the apprentices/followers of_him reported to_Yōannaʸs concerning all these \add things\add*. And the Yōannaʸs having_called_to some two of_the apprentices/followers of_him,
\v 19 sent \add them\add* to the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* saying: Are you the \add one\add* coming or may_we_be_waiting another?
\v 20 And having_arrived to him, the men said: Yōannaʸs the immerser sent_ us _out to you saying: Are you the \add one\add* coming or may_we_be_waiting \add for\add* another?
\v 21 In that the hour, he_healed many of diseases, and afflictions, and evil spirits and to_\add the\add*_blind to_be_seeing many he_granted.
\v 22 And answering he_said to_them: Having_been_gone, report to_Yōannaʸs what \add things\add* you_all_saw and you_all_heard: blind are_receiving_sight, lame are_walking, lepers are_being_cleansed, and deaf are_hearing, dead are_being_raised: poor are_being_good_message_preached.
\v 23 And blessed is_he who if may_ not _be_offended in me.
\v 24 And the messengers of_Yōannaʸs having_gone_away, he_began to_be_saying to the crowds concerning Yōannaʸs: What you_all_came_out into the wilderness to_see? \add A\add*_reed being_shaken by \add the\add*_wind?
\v 25 But what you_all_came_out to_see? \add A\add*_man having_been_dressed in fine clothes? Behold, the \add ones\add* in glorious clothing and being in_luxury in are the palaces.
\v 26 But what you_all_came_out to_see? \add A\add*_prophet? Yes, I_am_saying to_you_all, and more_important \add than\add* \add a\add*_prophet.
\v 27 This is \add he\add* concerning whom it_has_been_written: Behold, I_am_sending_out the messenger of_me before \add the\add*_face of_you, who will_be_preparing the way of_you before you.
\v 28 I_am_saying to_you_all, no_one is greater among \add those\add* born of_women Yōannaʸs, but the \add the\add*_least in the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* is greater \add than\add* he.
\v 29 (And all the people and the tax_collectors having_heard, they_justified the \nd god\nd*, having_been_immersed with_the immersion of_Yōannaʸs, 
\v 30 but the \add the\add*_Farisaios_\add party\add* and the lawyers, rejecting the counsel of_ the _\nd god\nd* for themselves, not having_been_immersed by him.)
\v 31 Therefore to_what I_will_be_likening the people of_ the this _generation, and to_what are_they similar?
\v 32 They_are similar to_little_children sitting which in \add the\add*_marketplace, and calling_out to_one_another, who is_saying: We_played_the_flute for_you_all and you_all_ not _danced, we_lamented and you_all_ not _wept.
\v 33 For/Because Yōannaʸs the immerser has_come, neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you_all_are_saying: He_is_having \add a\add*_demon.
\v 34 the son of_ the _man ˓Has˒_come, eating and drinking, and you_all_are_saying: Behold, \add a\add*_ glutton _man and \add a\add*_drunkard, \add a\add*_friend of_tax_collectors and of_sinners.
\v 35 And the wisdom was_justified by all the children of_her.
\v 36 And someone of_the Farisaios_\add party\add* was_asking him that he_may_eat with him, and having_come_in into the house of_the Farisaios_\add party_member\add*, he_was_reclined.
\v 37 And see \add a\add*_woman who was in the city \add a\add*_sinner, and having_known that he_is_reclining in the house of_the Farisaios_\add party_member\add*, having_brought_back \add an\add*_alabaster_flask of_ointment,
\v 38 and having_stood behind by the feet of_him weeping, she_began to_be_wetting the feet of_him with_the, tears, and she_was_wiping_off \add them\add* with_the hairs of_the head of_her, and was_kissing the feet of_him, and was_anointing \add them\add* with_the ointment.
\v 39 And the Farisaios_\add party_member\add*, the \add one\add* having_invited him having_seen, he_spoke by himself saying: This \add one\add* if he_was \add a\add*_prophet, would was_knowing who and what_kind_of the woman, who is_touching against_him, because she_is \add a\add*_sinner.
\v 40 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answering said to him: Simōn, I_am_having something to_say to_you. And he, is_saying. Teacher say \add it\add*,
\v 41 There_were two debtors to_\add a\add*_ certain _moneylender: the one was_owing five_hundred daʸnarion_\add coins\add*, and the other fifty.
\v 42 And them having no \add money\add* to_give_back, he_forgave to_both. Therefore which of_them, will_be_loving him more?
\v 43 And Simōn answering said: I_am_supposing that \add he\add* to_whom he_forgave the more. And he said to_him: You_judged correctly.
\v 44 And having_been_turned to the woman, he_was_saying to_ the _Simōn: You_are_seeing this the woman? I_came_in into the house of_you, you_ not _gave water to_me for feet, but this \add woman\add* wet the feet of_me the with_tears, and wiped_off \add them\add* with_the \add the\add*_hairs of_her.
\v 45 you_ not _gave \add A\add*_kiss to_me, but this \add woman\add* from which I_came_in, not ceased kissing the feet of_me.
\v 46 you_ not _anointed the head of_me, With_olive_oil, but this \add one\add* anointed the feet of_me with_ointment.
\v 47 for_reason_of of_which, I_am_saying to_you, the the many sins of_her have_been_forgiven, because she_loved much, but to_whom little is_being_forgiven, is_loving little.
\v 48 And he_said to_her: The sins of_you have_been_forgiven.
\v 49 And the \add ones\add* reclining began to_be_saying by themselves: Who is this who is_ even _forgiving sins?
\v 50 And he_said to the woman: The faith of_you has_saved you, be_going in peace.

\v 1 And it_became at the \add time\add* consecutively, and he was_travelling_through throughout \add the\add*_city and village, proclaiming and good_message_preaching the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and the twelve \add were\add* with him,
\v 2 and some women who were having_been_healed from evil spirits and sicknesses: Maria/(Miryām) who being_called from_Magdala, from whom seven demons had_come_out,
\v 3 and Yōanna wife of_Chusa \add a\add*_manager of_Haʸrōdaʸs, and Susanna, and many others, who were_serving unto_them from the \add things\add* possessing to_them.
\v 4 And \add a\add*_ great _crowd Coming_together and of_the \add ones\add* in \add the\add*_city journeying to him, he_spoke by parable:
\v 5 The \add one\add* sowing came_out which to_sow the seed of_him. And at the \add time\add* him to_be_sowing, some indeed fell along the road, and it_was_trampled and the birds of_the sky devoured it.
\v 6 And other fell_down on the rock, and having_been_sprouted was_withered because_of the \add thing\add* to_ not _be_having moisture.
\v 7 And other fell in \add the\add*_midst of_the thorns, and having_been_grown_up the thorns choked_ it _out.
\v 8 And other fell on the the good soil, also having_been_sprouted produced fruit \add a\add*_hundred_fold. These \add things\add* saying, he_was_calling: The \add one\add* having ears to_be_hearing, him _let_be_hearing.
\v 9 And the apprentices/followers of_him were_asking him: What this? might_be the parable?
\v 10 And he said: It_has_been_given to_you_all to_know the mysteries of_the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*, but to_the rest in parables, in_order_that seeing they_may_ not _be_seeing, and hearing they_may_ not _be_understanding.
\v 11 And this is the parable: the seed is the message of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 12 And the \add ones\add* along the road are the \add ones\add* having_heard, thereafter the devil is_coming and is_taking_away the message from the heart of_them, in_order_that not having_believed they_may_be_saved.
\v 13 And the \add ones\add* on the rock, who whenever they_may_hear with joy are_receiving the message, and these are_ not _having \add a\add*_root, who for \add a\add*_time are_believing, and in \add the\add*_time of_temptation they_are_withdrawing_from.
\v 14 And the \add seed\add* having_fallen into the thorns, these are the \add ones\add* having_heard, and going are_being_choked under worries, and riches, and gratifications of_ the _living, and are_ not _brought_to_maturity.
\v 15 But the \add seed\add* in the good soil, these are \add the_ones\add* who in \add a\add*_heart good and good, having_heard the message are_keeping \add it\add*, and are_bearing_fruit by endurance.
\v 16 And no_one having_lit \add a\add*_lamp, is_covering it with_\add a\add*_object or is_putting \add it\add* beneath \add a\add*_bed, but is_putting \add it\add* on \add a\add*_lampstand, in_order_that the \add ones\add* entering_in may_be_seeing the light.
\v 17 For/Because not is hidden which ˓will˒_ not _be_becoming manifest, nor secret which not may_ not _be_known and may_come to manifest.
\v 18 Therefore be_watching_out how you_all_are_hearing, because/for whoever wishfully may_be_having, will_be_being_given to_him, and whoever wishfully may_ not _be_having, even what he_is_supposing to_be_having will_be_being_taken_away from him.
\v 19 And the mother and the brothers of_him arrived to him, and they_were_ not _able to_reach to_him because_of the crowd.
\v 20 And it_was_reported to_him: The mother of_you and the brothers of_you, have_stood outside wanting to_see you.
\v 21 But he answering said to them: \add The\add*_mother of_me and \add the\add*_brothers of_me, these are the \add ones\add* hearing and doing the message of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 22 And it_became on one of_the days, and he and the apprentices/followers of_him boarded into \add a\add*_boat, and he_said to them: We_may_pass_through to the \add side\add* across of_the lake. And they_were_launched.
\v 23 But sailing of_them, he_fell_asleep. And \add a\add*_ of_wind _storm came_down on the lake, and they_were_being_swamped and they_were_risking_danger.
\v 24 And having_approached, they_awoke him saying: Master, master, we_are_perishing. And he having_been_awoke, gave_rebuke to_the wind, and to_the wave, of_the water, and they_ceased and it_became \add a\add*_calm.
\v 25 And he_said to_them: Where \add is\add* the faith of_you_all? And having_been_afraid, they_marvelled saying to one_another: Who consequently is this, that he_is_commanding both to_the winds and to_the water, and they_are_submitting to_him?
\v 26 And they_sailed_down to the region of_the Gerasaʸnōn, which is opposite the Galilaia/(Gālīl).
\v 27 And having_come_out to_him on the land, \add a\add*_ certain _man met \add him\add* out_of the city having demons, and for_ much _time not dressed_in garment, and was_ not _remaining in \add a\add*_house, but in the tombs.
\v 28 And having_seen the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, having_cried_out he_fell_before to_him, and with_\add a\add*_ loud _voice said: What to_me and to_you, \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, \add the\add*_son of_ The the highest _\nd god\nd*? I_am_beseeching of_you, you_may_ not _torment me. 
\v 29 for/because He_commanded to_the the spirit unclean to_come_out from the man. For/Because for/because_many times it_had_seized him, and he_was_being_bound with_chains and being_guarded in_shackles, and tearing the bonds, he_was_being_driven by the demon into the wildernesss.
\v 30 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* asked him: What to_you is \add the\add*_name? And he said: Many_thousands, because many demons came_in into him.
\v 31 And they_were_imploring him that he_may_ not _command to_them to_go_away into the abyss.
\v 32 And there was \add a\add*_herd of_ many _pigs being_fed on the mountain, and they_implored him that he_may_permit to_them to_come_in into those. And he_permitted to_them.
\v 33 And the demons having_come_out from the man, they_came_in into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep_bank into the lake, and was_drowned.
\v 34 And the \add ones\add* feeding \add them\add* having_seen, the \add thing\add* having_become, they_fled and they_reported to the city and to the country.
\v 35 And they_came_out to_see the \add thing\add* having_become, and came to the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, and found the man sitting, from whom the demons came_out, having_been_clothed and being_sensible before the feet of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous\nd*, and they_were_afraid.
\v 36 And the \add ones\add* having_seen \add it\add* reported to_them, how the \add one\add* having_been_demon_possessed was_healed.
\v 37 And all the multitude of_the surrounding_region of_the Gerasaʸnōn asked, him, to_go_away from them, because they_were_being_gripped_with with_ great _fear. And he having_boarded, into \add the\add*_boat, returned.
\v 38 But the man from whom had_come_out the demons, was_beseeching of_him, to_be with him. But he_sent_ him _away saying,
\v 39 Be_returning to the house of_you, and be_describing as_much_as the \nd god\nd* did for_you. And he_went_away throughout all the city, proclaiming as_much_as the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* did for_him.
\v 40 And at the \add time\add* the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* to_be_returning, the crowd welcomed him, because/for were all waiting for_him.
\v 41 And see, \add a\add*_man came to_whose name \add was\add* Yaeiros, and this \add one\add* was_being \add a\add*_ruler of_the synagogue, and having_fallen before the feet of_\nd Yaʸsous\nd*, he_was_imploring him to_come_in to the house of_him,
\v 42 because \add a\add*_ only_begotten _daughter was to_him, about twelve of_years, and she was_dying_off. But at the \add time\add* to_be_going him, the crowds were_pressing_against him.
\v 43 And \add a\add*_woman being with \add a\add*_hemorrhage of_blood for twelve years, who was_ not _able to_be_healed by no_one,
\v 44 having_approached behind, she_touched against_the fringe of_the garment of_him, and immediately the hemorrhage of_the blood of_her stopped.
\v 45 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said: Who \add is\add* the \add one\add* having_touched against_me? And disowning \add it\add* all, the Petros said: Master, the crowds are_pressing you and they_are_pressing_in.
\v 46 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said: Someone touched against_me, because/for I knew power having_come_out from me.
\v 47 And the woman having_seen that she_ not _escaped_notice, came trembling and having_fallen_before to_him, she_reported before all for what cause she_touched against_him, the people, and how she_was_healed immediately.
\v 48 And he said to_her: Daughter, the faith of_you has_healed you, be_going in peace.
\v 49 Still of_him speaking, someone is_coming from the synagogue_leader saying, that the daughter of_you ˓Has˒_died, be_troubling the teacher no_longer.
\v 50 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_heard, answered to_him: Be_ not _fearing, only be_believing, and she_will_be_being_healed.
\v 51 And having_come into the house, he_ not _allowed anyone to_come_in, with him, except not/lest Petros, and Yōannaʸs, and Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), and the father of_the girl, and the mother.
\v 52 And all were_weeping and they_were_mourning for_her. But he said: Be_ not _weeping, because/for she_ not _died_off, but she_is_sleeping.
\v 53 And they_were_ridiculing of_him, having_known that she_died_off.
\v 54 And he having_taken_hold of_the hand of_her, called saying: - girl, be_raising. 
\v 55 And the spirit of_her returned, and she_rose_up immediately, and he_directed to_her to_be_given \add something\add* to_eat.
\v 56 And the parents of_her marvelled, but he he_commanded to_them to_tell no_one what having_become.
\c 9
\v 1 And having_called_together the twelve, he_gave to_them power and authority over all the demons, and to_be_healing diseases,
\v 2 and he_sent_ them _out to_be_proclaiming the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and to_be_healing the sick.
\v 3 And he_said to them: Be_taking_ nothing _away for the journey, neither staff, nor knapsack, nor bread, nor silver, nor to_be_having two tunics.
\v 4 And into whatever wishfully house you_all_may_come_in, be_remaining there and from_there be_coming_out.
\v 5 And as_many_as wishfully may_ not _be_receiving you_all, coming_out from the that city, be_shaking_off the dust from the feet of_you_all, because/for \add a\add*_testimony against them.
\v 6 And coming_out, they_were_passing_through throughout the villages, good_message_preaching and healing everywhere.
\v 7 And Haʸrōdaʸs the quarter_ruler heard the \add things\add* becoming all, and was_thoroughly_perplexing, because_of the \add thing\add* to_be_being_said by some that Yōannaʸs was_raised from \add the\add*_dead,
\v 8 and by some that Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*) was_seen, and by_others that \add a\add*_certain prophet of_the ancients rose_up.
\v 9 And Haʸrōdaʸs said: I beheaded Yōannaʸs, but who is this concerning whom I_am_hearing such \add things\add*? And he_was_seeking to_see him.
\v 10 And having_returned, the ambassadors described to_him as_much_as they_did. And having_taken them, he_withdrew by himself into \add a\add*_city being_called Baʸthsaida.
\v 11 But the crowds having_known, followed after_him. And having_welcomed them, he_was_speaking to_them concerning the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*, and he_was_healing the \add ones\add* having need of_healing.
\v 12 And the day began to_be_declining, and the twelve having_approached said to_him: Send_away the crowd, in_order_that having_been_gone into the surrounding villages and country, they_may_lodge and they_may_find provisions, because we_are here in \add a\add*_desolate place.
\v 13 But he_said to them: You_all give \add something\add* to_them. to_eat. But they said: Not to_us are more than five loaves and two fishes, if surely_not having_been_gone, we may_buy foods for all the this people.
\v 14 For/Because they_were about five_thousand men.) And he_said to the apprentices/followers of_him: Recline them in_groups about fifty each.
\v 15 And thus they_did, and they_ all _reclined.
\v 16 And having_taken the five loaves and the two fishes, having_looked_up to the sky, he_blessed them and broke_up \add them\add*, and was_giving \add them\add* to_the apprentices/followers to_set_before before_the crowd.
\v 17 And all ate and were_satisfied, and twelve baskets was_ the \add amount\add* _taken_up having_been_leftover to_them of_\add the\add*_fragments.
\v 18 And it_became at the \add time\add* him to_be praying down/against/according_to alone, the apprentices/followers were_being_with with_him, and he_asked them saying: Whom are_ crowds _saying the me to_be?
\v 19 And they answering said: Yōannaʸs the immerser, and others, Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*), but others that \add a\add*_certain prophet of_the ancients rose_up.
\v 20 And he_said to_them: But whom you_all are_saying me to_be? And Petros answering said: The \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 21 And he, having_warned to_them, commanded \add them\add* to_be_telling this to_no_one,
\v 22 having_said, that It_is_fitting the son of_ the _man to_suffer many \add things\add*, and to_be_rejected by the elders, and chief_priests, and scribes, and to_be_killed_off and on_the third day to_be_raised.
\v 23 And he_was_saying to all: If anyone is_wanting to_be_coming after me, him_let_renounce himself, and him_let_take_up the stake of_him in_every day, and him _let_be_following after_me.
\v 24 For/Because whoever wishfully may_be_wanting to_save the life of_him, will_be_losing it, but whoever wishfully may_lose the life of_him on_account me, this \add one\add* will_be_saving it.
\v 25 For/Because what is_being_benefited \add a\add*_person, having_gained the whole world, and having_destroyed himself or having_been_lost?
\v 26 For/Because whoever wishfully may_be_ashamed_of me and the my messages, this \add one\add* the son of_ the _man will_be_being_ashamed \add of\add*, whenever he_may_come in the glory of_him, and of_the father, and of_the holy messengers.
\v 27 But I_am_saying to_you_all truly, are some of_the \add ones\add* having_stood here, who by_no_means may_ not _taste of_death, until wishfully they_may_see the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 28 And it_became about eight days after the these sayings, having_taken Petros, and Yōannaʸs, and Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), he_went_up on the mountain to_pray.
\v 29 And it_became at the \add time\add* him to_be_praying, the appearance of_the face of_him different, and the clothing of_him gleaming white.
\v 30 And see, two men were_conversing_with with_him, who were Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) and Aʸlias/(ʼĒliy\sup yāh\sup*),
\v 31 who having_been_seen in glory, were_spoken the departure of_him, which he_was_going to_be_fulfilling in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim).
\v 32 And the Petros and the \add ones\add* with him were having_been_weighed_down with_sleep, but having_fully_awoken they_saw the glory of_him, and the two men which having_stood_with with_him.
\v 33 And it_became at the \add time\add* them to_be_being_departed from him, the Petros said to the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*: Master, it_is good for_us here to_be, and we_may_make three tents: one for_you, and one for_Mōsaʸs, and one for_Aʸlias, not having_known what he_is_saying.
\v 34 And of_him saying these \add things\add*, \add a\add*_cloud became and overshadowed them, and they_were_afraid at the \add time\add* to_come_in them into the cloud.
\v 35 And \add a\add*_voice became out_of the cloud saying: This is the son of_me, the \add one\add* having_been_chosen, be_hearing from_him.
\v 36 And at the \add time\add* the voice to_become, only \nd Yaʸsous\nd* was_found. And they kept_silent, and they_reported to_no_one in those the days nothing of_what \add things\add* they_have_seen.
\v 37 And it_became on_the next day, of_them having_come_down from the mountain, \add a\add*_ great _crowd met with_him.
\v 38 And see, \add a\add*_man from the crowd shouted saying: Teacher, I_am_beseeching of_you to_look_at at the son of_me, because he_is \add an\add*_only_begotten to_me.
\v 39 And see, \add a\add*_spirit is_taking him, and suddenly he_is_crying_out and it_is_convulsing him with foam, and is_going_away from him, with_difficultly, bruising him.
\v 40 And I_was_besought of_the apprentices/followers of_you that they_may_throw_out it, and they_were_ not _able.
\v 41 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answering said: Oh unbelieving generation and having_been_perverted, until when I_will_be with you_all and I_will_be_tolerating of_you_all? Bring_forward here the son of_you.
\v 42 And still approaching of_him, the demon attacked him and threw_into_convulsions \add him\add*. But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* gave_rebuke to_the the unclean spirit, and he_healed the boy and gave_ him _back to_the father of_him.
\v 43 And all were_being_astonished at the greatness of_ the _\nd god\nd*. But all wondering at all which he_was_doing, he_said to the apprentices/followers of_him,
\v 44 You_all set into the ears of_you_all the these messages, because/for the son of_ the _man is_going to_be_being_given_over into \add the\add*_hands of_people.
\v 45 But they were_not_knowing the this saying, and it_was having_been_concealed from them, in_order_that they_may_ not _sense it, and they_were_fearing to_ask him concerning the this saying.
\v 46 And \add a\add*_speculation came_in among them, who wishfully might_be the_ greater _\add one\add* of_them.
\v 47 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_known the speculation of_the heart of_them, having_taken_hold_of \add a\add*_little_child, stood it by himself,
\v 48 and said to_them: Whoever if may_receive this the little_child in the name of_me, is_receiving me, and whoever wishfully may_receive me, is_receiving the \add one\add* having_sent_out me. For/Because the \add one\add* being least among all you_all, this \add one\add* is great.
\v 49 And Yōannaʸs answering said: Master, we_saw someone throwing_out demons in the name of_you, and we_were_forbidding him, because he_is_ not _following with us.
\v 50 But the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to him: Be_ not _forbidding \add him\add*, because/for who is not against you_all, is for you_all.
\v 51 And it_became at the \add time\add* to_be_being_fulfilled the days of_the ascension of_him, and he established his face, which to_be_going to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim),
\v 52 and he_sent_out messengers before \add the\add*_face of_him. And having_been_gone, they_came_in into \add a\add*_village of_\add the\add*_Samareitaʸs/(Shomrōn), so_as to_prepare for_him.
\v 53 And they_ not _received him, because the face of_him was going toward Hierousalaʸm.
\v 54 And having_seen \add it\add*, the apprentices/followers Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ) and Yōannaʸs said: \nd master\nd*, are_you_willing \add that\add* we_may_call fire to_come_down from the sky and to_consume_ them _up?
\v 55 But having_been_turned, he_gave_rebuke to_them.
\v 56 And they_were_gone to another village.
\v 57 And going of_them on the road, someone said to him: I_will_be_following after_you wherever if you_may_be_going_away.
\v 58 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_him: - foxes are_having burrows, and the birds of_the sky nests, but the son of_ the _man is_ not _having where his head may_be_laying.
\v 59 And he_said to another: Be_following after_me. But he said: \nd master\nd*, permit to_me having_gone_away, first to_bury the father of_me.
\v 60 But he_said to_him: Leave the dead to_bury the dead by_themselves, but you having_gone_away, be_proclaiming the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 61 And also another he_said: I_will_be_following after_you, \nd master\nd*, but first permit to_me to_bid_goodbye to_the \add ones\add* at the home of_me.
\v 62 But the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said: No_one Having_laid_on the hand of_him on \add the\add*_plow, and looking on the \add things\add* behind, is suitable in_the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\c 10
\v 1 And after, these \add things\add* the \nd master\nd* appointed seventy two others, and he_sent_out them each by_two before \add the\add*_face of_him, into every city and place where he was_going to_be_coming.
\v 2 He_was_saying but to them: On_one_hand the harvest great, on_the_other_hand the workers few. Therefore be_besought of_the \nd master\nd* of_the harvest, so_that workers he_may_throw_out into the harvest of_him.
\v 3 Be_going see, I_am_sending_ you_all _out as lambs in \add the\add*_midst of_wolves.
\v 4 Be_bearing neither purse, nor knapsack, nor sandals, and you_all_may_greet no_one on the road.
\v 5 And whatever house wishfully you_all_may_come_in into, first be_saying: Peace to_ the this _house.
\v 6 And if there may_be \add a\add*_son of_peace, the peace of_you_all will_be_resting_on on it, but if not surely it_will_be_returning to you_all.
\v 7 And be_remaining in \add the\add*_same the house, eating and drinking the \add things\add* from them, because/for the worker \add is\add* worthy of_the wage of_him. Be_ not _moving from house to house.
\v 8 And into whatever wishfully city you_all_may_be_coming_in, and they_may_be_receiving you_all, be_eating the \add things\add* being_set_before before_you_all.
\v 9 And be_healing the sick in it, and be_saying to_them, the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* ˓Has˒_neared to you_all.
\v 10 But into whatever wishfully city you_all_may_come_in, and they_may_ not _be_receiving you_all, having_come_out into the roads of_it say,
\v 11 We_are_wiping_off to_you_all even the dust which having_been_joined_together to the feet to_us out_of the city of_you_all, however be_knowing this that the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* has_neared.
\v 12 I_am_saying to_you_all that will_be more_tolerable for_Sodoma/(Şədom) in the that, day, than the for_ that _city.
\v 13 Woe to_you, Ⱪorazin. Woe to_you, Baʸthsaida. Because if the miracles and Sidōn/(Tsīdōn) were_become, which having_become in you_all in Turos/(Tsor), they_ would _repented sitting in sackcloth and ashes long_ago.
\v 14 However it_will_be more_tolerable for_Turos and Sidōn, in the judgment than for_you_all.
\v 15 And you, Kafarnaʼoum, you_˓will˒_ not _be_being_exalted to heaven? You_will_be_being_coming_down to Haidaʸs.
\v 16 The \add one\add* hearing from_you_all, is_hearing from_me, and the \add one\add* rejecting you_all, is_rejecting me, and the \add one\add* rejecting me, is_rejecting the \add one\add* having_sent_ me _out.
\v 17 And the seventy two returned with joy saying: \nd master\nd*, even the demons is_being_subjected to_us in the name of_you.
\v 18 And he_said to_them: I_was_observing the Satan/(Sāţān) having_fallen as lightning out_of the heaven.
\v 19 Behold, I_have_given to_you_all the authority which to_be_treading on serpents and scorpions, and on all the power of_the enemy, and nothing may_ not _injure you_all by_no_means.
\v 20 However in this be_ not _rejoicing that the spirits is_being_subjected to_you_all, but be_rejoicing that the names of_you_all has_been_inscribed in the heavens.
\v 21 In \add the\add*_same the hour, he_exulted in_the the holy \nd spirit\nd* and said: I_am_confessing to_you, father, \nd master\nd* of_ the _heaven and the earth, that you_hidden_away these \add things\add* from \add the\add*_wise and intelligent, and you_revealed them to_infants. Yes. the father, because thus it_became good_pleasure before you.
\v 22 All \add things\add* was_given_over to_me by the father of_me, and no_one is_knowing who is the son, except not/lest the father, and who is the father, except not/lest the son and to_whom if the son may_be_wishing to_reveal \add him\add*.
\v 23 And having_been_turned to the apprentices/followers he_said by himself: Blessed \add are\add* the eyes the \add ones\add* seeing what you_all_are_seeing. 
\v 24 For/Because I_am_saying to_you_all that many prophets and kings wanted to_see what you_all are_seeing, and they_ not _saw, and to_hear what you_all_are_hearing, and they_ not _heard.
\v 25 And see, \add a\add*_ certain _lawyer stood_up, testing him saying: Teacher, having_done what, ˓will˒_I_be_inheriting life eternal?
\v 26 And he said to him: In the law what has_it_˓been˒_written? How you_are_reading \add it\add*?
\v 27 And he answering said: You_will_be_loving \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* the \nd god\nd* of_you, with all \add the\add*_heart of_you, and with all the soul of_you, and with all the strength of_you, and with all the mind of_you, and: The neighbor of_you as yourself.
\v 28 And he_said to_him: You_answered correctly. Be_doing this, and you_will_be_living.
\v 29 But he wanting to_justify himself, said to the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*: And who is \add the\add*_neighbor of_me?
\v 30 the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_replied said: \add A\add*_ certain _man was_coming_down from Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) to Yeriⱪō/(Yərīḩō), and he_fell_among among_robbers, who both having_stripped_ him _off, and having_inflicted wounds, they_went_away having_left \add him\add* half_dead.
\v 31 And by coincidence \add a\add*_ certain _priest was_coming_down on the that road, and having_seen him passed_by_opposite.
\v 32 And likewise also \add a\add*_Leuitaʸs/(from_tribe_of_Lēvī) having_become to the place, having_come and having_seen passed_by_opposite.
\v 33 But \add a\add*_ certain _from_Samareia/(Shomrōn) journeying came to him, and having_seen he_was_feeling_compassion
\v 34 and having_approached, he_bound_up the wounds of_him, pouring_on olive_oil and wine, and having_mounted him on his own mount, he_brought him to \add an\add*_inn and was_taken_care of_him.
\v 35 And on next the \add day\add* having_throw_out, he_gave two daʸnarion_\add coins\add* to_the innkeeper, and said: Be_taking_care of_him, and whatever anything wishfully you_may_additionally_spend, I on the \add way\add* me to_be_returning I_will_be_giving_back to_you.
\v 36 Which of_these the three is_supposing to_you to_have_become \add a\add*_neighbor, of_the \add one\add* having_fallen_in among the robbers?
\v 37 And he said: The \add one\add* having_done the mercy with him. And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_him: Be_going and you be_doing likewise.
\v 38 And at the \add time\add* them to_be_going, he came_in into \add a\add*_ certain _village, and \add a\add*_ \add a\add*_certain _woman by_\add the\add*_name Martha welcomed him,
\v 39 and to_this \add woman\add* she_was \add a\add*_sister being_called Maria/(Miryām), who also having_been_seated_beside at the feet the of_\nd Yaʸsous\nd*, was_hearing the message of_him.
\v 40 But the Martha was_being_pulled_away about much service, and having_approached said: \nd master\nd*, not is_it_mattering to_you that the sister of_me left only me to_be_serving? Therefore tell to_her that she_may_help with_me. 
\v 41 But the \nd master\nd* answering said to_her: Martha, Martha, you_are_worrying and you_are_being_troubled about many \add things\add*,
\v 42 but there_is need of_one, Maria chose for the good portion, which ˓will˒_ not _be_being_taken_away from her.
\c 11
\v 1 And it_became at the \add time\add* him to_be in \add a\add*_ certain _place praying, when he_ceased, someone of_the apprentices/followers of_him said to him: \nd master\nd*, teach us to_be_praying, as also Yōannaʸs taught the apprentices/followers of_him.
\v 2 And he_said to_them: Whenever you_all_may_be_praying, be_saying: father, let_ the name of_you _be_sanctified. let_ the kingdom of_you. _Come.
\v 3 Be_giving the the to_us daily_needed bread of_us, which in_every day.
\v 4 And forgive to_us the sins of_us, because/for also we_ ourselves _are_forgiving to_everyone owing to_us. And not may_you_carry_in us into temptation.
\v 5 And he_said to them: Who of you_all will_be_having \add a\add*_friend, and will_be_going to him at_midnight, and may_say to_him: Friend, lend three loaves to_me,
\v 6 since \add a\add*_friend of_me arrived from \add a\add*_journey to me, and I_am_ not _having what I_will_be_setting_before to_him.
\v 7 And_that \add one\add* inside answering may_say: Be_ not _bringing_about to_me troubles, the door has_been_shut already, and the little_children of_me are with me in the bed, I_am_ not _being_able having_risen_up to_give \add anything\add* to_you.
\v 8 I_am_saying to_you_all, even if ˓will˒_ not _be_giving to_him having_risen_up, because_of that to_be friend of_him, surely because_of the persistence of_him having_been_raised, will_be_giving to_him of_as_much_as he_is_needing.
\v 9 And_I am_saying to_you_all: Be_requesting, and it_will_be_being_given to_you_all, be_seeking, and you_all_will_be_finding, be_knocking, and it_will_be_being_opened_up to_you_all.
\v 10 For/Because everyone which requesting is_receiving, and the \add one\add* seeking is_finding, and to_the \add one\add* knocking it_will_be_being_opened_up.
\v 11 and who of of_you_all the son will_be_requesting the father, \add a\add*_fish, and instead_of \add a\add*_fish, will_be_handing_out \add a\add*_serpent? to_him
\v 12 or also will_be_requesting \add an\add*_egg, will_be_handing_out \add a\add*_scorpion to_him?
\v 13 Therefore if you_all being evil, have_known good gifts to_be_giving to_the children of_you_all, for_how_much more the father who \add is\add* of heaven will_be_giving \add the\add*_ holy _\nd spirit\nd* to_the \add ones\add* requesting him?
\v 14 And he_was throwing_out \add a\add*_ mute _demon. And it_became the demon having_come_out, the mute \add man\add* spoke. And the crowds marvelled.
\v 15 But some of them said: He_is_throwing_out the demons by Beʼelzeboul the ruler of_the demons.
\v 16 And others testing, were_seeking \add a\add*_sign from \add the\add*_sky from him.
\v 17 But he having_known the thoughts of_them said to_them: Every kingdom having_been_divided against itself is_being_desolated, and \add a\add*_house against \add a\add*_house is_falling.
\v 18 And if the Satan/(Sāţān) also was_divided against himself, how ˓will˒_ the kingdom of_him _be_being_stood? Because you_all_are_saying, by Beʼelzeboul me to_be_throwing_out the demons.
\v 19 And if I am_throwing_out the demons by Beʼelzeboul, by whom are_ the sons of_you_all _throwing_out? Because_of this, they will_be judges of_you_all.
\v 20 But if I am_throwing_out the demons by \add the\add*_finger of_\nd god\nd*, consequently the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* came on you_all.
\v 21 Whenever the strong \add one\add* having_been_armed, may_be_guarding the palace of_himself, the \add things\add* possessing of_him is, in peace, 
\v 22 but when stronger \add than\add* him having_come_over, may_overcome him, he_is_taking_away the whole_armor of_him in which he_had_trusted, and is_distributing the plunder of_him.
\v 23 The \add one\add* being not with me, is against me, and the \add one\add* not gathering_together with me, is_scattering.
\v 24 whenever the unclean spirit may_come_out from the person, it_is_passing_through through waterless places seeking rest, and not finding, it_is_saying: I_will_be_returning to the house of_me, whence I_came_out.
\v 25 And having_come, it_is_finding \add it\add* having_been_swept and having_been_adorned.
\v 26 Then it_is_going and is_taking seven other spirits more_evil \add than\add* itself, and having_come_in, is_dwelling there, and the last of_ the that _person is_becoming, worse \add than\add* the first.
\v 27 And it_became at the \add time\add* him to_be_saying these \add things\add*, \add a\add*_certain woman from the crowd having_lifted_up \add a\add*_voice, said to_him: Blessed \add is\add* the womb which having_borne you, and \add the\add*_breasts which you_nursed.
\v 28 But he said: Indeed_rather, blessed \add are\add* the \add ones\add* hearing the message of_ the _\nd god\nd* and keeping \add it\add*.
\v 29 And the crowds being_increased, he_began to_be_saying: - this generation is evil generation, it_is_seeking \add a\add*_sign and \add a\add*_sign ˓will˒_ not _be_being_given to_it, except not/lest the sign of_Yōnas/(Yōnāh).
\v 30 For/Because as Yōnas became \add a\add*_sign to_the Nineuitaʸs/(\add ones\add*_from_Nīnəvēh), thus the son of_ the _man also will_be to_ the this _generation.
\v 31 \add The\add*_queen of_\add the\add*_south will_be_being_raised at the judgment with the men the this generation, and will_be_condemning them, because she_came from the ends of_the earth to_hear the wisdom of_Solomōn/(Shəlmoh), and see, one_greater \add than\add* Solomōn \add is\add* here.
\v 32 Nineuitaʸs/(\add ones\add*_from_Nīnəvēh) men will_be_standing_up at the judgment with the this generation, and they_will_be_condemning it, because they_repented at the proclamation of_Yōnas, and see, one_greater \add than\add* Yōnas \add is\add* here.
\v 33 no_one having_lit \add a\add*_lamp is_putting \add it\add* in \add a\add*_hidden_place, nor under the basket, but on the lampstand, in_order_that the \add ones\add* entering_in may_be_seeing the light.
\v 34 The lamp of_the body is the eye of_you. Whenever the eye of_you may_be healthy, all the body of_you is also bright, but when evil may_be, the body of_you \add is\add* also dark.
\v 35 Therefore be_looking_out, lest the light which in you is darkness.
\v 36 Therefore if the whole body of_you \add is\add* bright, not having any dark part, it_will_ all _be bright, as whenever the lamp may_be_illuminating you the with_shining.
\v 37 And at the \add time\add* to_speak, \add a\add*_Farisaios_\add party_member\add* is_asking him so_that he_may_eat_breakfast with him, and having_come_in, he_sat_down.
\v 38 And the Farisaios_\add party_member\add* having_seen \add it\add*, marvelled that he_was_ not first _washed before the dinner.
\v 39 But the \nd master\nd* said to him: Now you_all the Farisaios_\add party\add* are_cleansing the \add part\add* outside of_the cup and of_the platter, and which inside of_you_all is_being_full of_theft and wickedness.
\v 40 Foolish. Not the \add one\add* having_made the_ outside _\add part\add*, also made the_ inside _\add part\add*?
\v 41 However give as_alms the \add things\add* being_within, and see, all \add things\add* is clean to_you_all.
\v 42 But woe to_you_all the Farisaios_\add party\add*, because you_all_are_tithing the mint, and the rue, and every garden_plant, and you_all_are_passing_by the justice and the love of_ the _\nd god\nd*. And these \add things\add* it_was_fitting to_do, and_those \add things\add* to_ not _neglect.
\v 43 Woe to_you_all the Farisaios_\add party\add*, because you_all_are_loving the best_seat in the synagogues, and the greetings in the marketplaces.
\v 44 Woe to_you_all, because you_all_are as the the unseen tombs, and the people walking over they_have_ not _known \add it\add*.
\v 45 And someone of_the lawyers answering is_saying to_him: Teacher, saying these \add things\add*, you_are_insulting us also.
\v 46 But he said, woe also to_you_all the lawyers. Because you_all_are_burdening the people with_ unbearable _burdens, and yourselves you_all_are_ not _touching upon_the burdens with_one of_the fingers of_you_all.
\v 47 Woe to_you_all, because you_all_are_building the tombs of_the prophets, but the fathers of_you_all killed_ them _off.
\v 48 Consequently you_all_are_testifying and you_all_are_consenting to_the works of_the fathers of_you_all, because they on_one_hand killed_ them _off, on_the_other_hand you_all are_building \add their_tombs\add*.
\v 49 Because_of this the wisdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* also said: I_will_be_sending_out prophets and ambassadors to them, and they_will_be_killing_off and they_will_be_persecuting of them,
\v 50 in_order_that the blood of_all the prophets, which being_poured_out from \add the\add*_foundation of_\add the\add*_world may_be_sought_out, from the this generation,
\v 51 from \add the\add*_blood of_Abel/(Heⱱel) to \add the\add*_blood of_Zaⱪarias, of_the \add one\add* having_destroyed between the altar and the house. Yes, I_am_saying to_you_all, it_will_be_being_sought_out from the this generation.
\v 52 Woe to_you_all the lawyers, because you_all_took_away the key of_the knowledge, yourselves you_all_ not _came_in, and you_all_forbade the \add ones\add* coming_in.
\v 53 And_from_there of_him of_having_come_out, the scribes and the Farisaios_\add party\add* began to_be_resenting \add him\add* terribly, and to_be_interrogating him about more \add things\add*,
\v 54 lying_in_wait him to_catch something out_of the mouth of_him.
\c 12
\v 1 In which \add things\add* the tens_of_thousands of_the crowd, having_been_gathered_together, so_as to_be_trampling one_another, he_began to_be_saying to the apprentices/followers of_him first: Be_taking_heed to_yourselves of the leaven, of_the Farisaios_\add party\add*, which is hypocrisy.
\v 2 But there_is nothing having_been_covered_up, which ˓will˒_ not _be_being_revealed, and hidden which ˓will˒_ not _be_being_known.
\v 3 Instead_of that as_much_as you_all_said in the darkness, will_be_being_heard in the light, and what you_all_spoke to the ear in the private_rooms, will_be_being_proclaimed on the housetops.
\v 4 And I_am_saying to_you_all, the friends of_me, be_ not _afraid of of_the \add ones\add* killing_off the body, and after these \add things\add* not having anything more_abundant to_do.
\v 5 But I_will_be_showing to_you_all whom you_may_be_afraid: be_afraid of_the \add one\add* after the \add time\add* to_kill_off, having authority to_throw_in \add him\add* into the geenna, yes, I_am_saying to_you_all, be_fearing this \add one\add*.
\v 6 are_ not five sparrows _being_sold for_ two _assarions? And not one of them is having_been_forgotten before the \nd god\nd*.
\v 7 But even the hairs of_the head of_you_all all have_been_numbered. Be_ not _fearing, you_all_are_carrying_value \add than\add* many sparrows.
\v 8 And I_am_saying to_you_all, everyone who wishfully may_confess in me before the people, also the son of_ the _man will_be_confessing, in him before the messengers of_ the _\nd god\nd*, 
\v 9 but the \add one\add* having_disowned me before the people, will_be_being_renounced before the messengers of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 10 And everyone who will_be_saying \add a\add*_message against the son of_ the _Man, will_be_being_forgiven to_him, but to_the \add one\add* having_slandered against the holy \nd spirit\nd*, ˓will˒_ not _be_being_forgiven.
\v 11 And whenever they_may_be_carrying_in you_all before the synagogues, and the rulers, and the authorities, you_all_may_ not _worry how or what you_all_may_defend or what you_all_may_say, 
\v 12 for/because the holy \nd spirit\nd* will_be_teaching you_all in \add the\add*_same the hour what it_is_fitting to_say.
\v 13 And someone from the crowd said to_him: Teacher, tell to_the brother of_me to_divide the inheritance with me.
\v 14 But he he_said to_him: Man, who me appointed \add a\add*_judge or arbitrator over you_all?
\v 15 And he_said to them: Be_watching and be_keeping from all greediness, because the life of_him is not in the \add thing\add* to_be_being_plentiful to_anyone, of the \add things\add* possessing to_him.
\v 16 And he_spoke \add a\add*_parable to them saying: The land of_\add a\add*_ certain rich _man yielded_well.
\v 17 And he_was_reasoning by himself saying: What I_may_do, because I_am_ not _having where I_will_be_gathering_together the fruits of_me?
\v 18 And he_said: This I_will_be_doing: I_will_be_taking_down the barns and greater \add barns\add* of_me and I_will_be_building, I_will_be_gathering_together there all the grain and the good \add things\add* of_me.
\v 19 And I_will_be_saying to_the soul of_me: Soul, you_are_having many good \add things\add* lying for many years, be_resting, eat, drink, be_being_gladdened.
\v 20 But the \nd god\nd* said to_him: Foolish, on_this the night, requesting of you the soul of_you, and what you_prepared, to_whom it_will_be?
\v 21 Thus the \add one\add* storing_up for_himself and not being_rich toward \nd god\nd*.
\v 22 And he_said to the apprentices/followers Because_of this I_am_saying to_you_all, be_ not _worrying for_your life, what you_all_may_eat nor for_the body what you_all_may_dress_in.
\v 23 For/Because your life is more \add than\add* the food, and the body \add than\add* the clothing.
\v 24 Observe the ravens, because they_are_ not _sowing nor are_they_reaping, to_which not is \add a\add*_storeroom nor barn, and the \nd god\nd* is_feeding them. For/Because_how_much more you_all are_carrying_value \add than\add* the birds. 
\v 25 And which of you_all worrying, is_able to_add \add an\add*_hour to the lifespan of_him?
\v 26 Therefore if you_all_are_ not_even _being_able \add the\add*_least, why are_you_all_worrying about the rest?
\v 27 Observe the lilies how it_is_growing, neither it_is_labouring nor it_is_spinning, but I_am_saying to_you_all, not_even Solomōn/(Shəlmoh) in all the glory of_him, clothed as one of_these.
\v 28 But if the \nd god\nd* is_ thus _dressing the grass in \add the\add*_field being \add here\add* today, and tomorrow being_thrown into \add a\add*_furnace, for_how_much rather you_all, little_faith \add ones\add*?
\v 29 Also you_all be_ not _seeking what you_all_may_eat, or what you_all_may_drink, and be_ not _being_worried.
\v 30 For/Because all the nations of_the world are_seeking_after these \add things\add*, but the father of_you_all has_known that you_all_are_needing of_these \add things\add*.
\v 31 However be_seeking the kingdom of_him, and these \add things\add* will_be_being_added to_you_all.
\v 32 Be_ not _fearing, the little flock, because the father of_you_all took_pleasure, to_give to_you_all the kingdom.
\v 33 Sell the \add things\add* possessing of_you_all, and give alms. Make to_yourselves purses not being_grown_old, \add a\add*_treasure inexhaustible in the heavens, where thief is_ not _nearing nor moth is_ruining.
\v 34 For/Because where is the treasure of_you_all, there also the heart of_you_all will_be.
\v 35 Let_be the loins of_you_all having_been_girded_about, and the lamps being_burned,
\v 36 and you_all similar to_people waiting_for the master of_themselves, when he_may_depart from the wedding_festivities, in_order_that having_come and having_knocked, they_may_open_up to_him. immediately.
\v 37 Blessed \add are\add* the those slaves, whom the \nd master\nd* having_come, will_be_finding watching. Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that he_will_be_girding_about \add himself\add* and will_be_reclining them, and having_come_up, he_will_be_serving unto_them.
\v 38 And_if he_may_come in the second even_if in the third watch, and may_find \add them\add* thus, blessed are those. 
\v 39 But be_knowing this, that if the home_owner had_known in_what hour the thief is_coming, he_watched would and he_ would not _allowed the house of_him to_be_dug_through.
\v 40 Also you_all be_becoming ready, because you_all_are_ not _supposing in_what hour, the son of_ the _man is_coming.
\v 41 And the Petros said: \nd master\nd*, are_you_telling the this parable to us, or also to all?
\v 42 And the \nd master\nd* said: Who consequently is the faithful prudent manager the, whom the \nd master\nd* will_be_appointing over the service of_him, which to_be_giving ration in season?
\v 43 Blessed \add is\add* the that slave, whom the master of_him having_come, will_be_finding doing thus.
\v 44 Truly I_am_saying to_you_all that he_will_be_appointing him over all the \add things\add* possessing of_him.
\v 45 But if the that slave may_say in the heart of_him, the master of_me Is_delaying to_be_coming, and may_begin to_be_striking the servant_boys and the servant_girls, to_be_eating and/both and to_be_drinking and to_be_being_drunk,
\v 46 the master of_ the that _slave will_be_coming in \add a\add*_day which he_is_ not _expecting, and in \add an\add*_hour which he_is_ not _knowing, and will_be_dismembering him, and will_be_appointing the portion of_him with the unbelievers.
\v 47 And that the slave, which having_known the will of_the master of_him, and not having_prepared or having_done for the will of_him, will_be_being_beat many \add blows\add*, 
\v 48 but the \add one\add* not having_known, but having_done \add things\add* worthy of_beatings, will_be_being_beat few \add blows\add*. And to_everyone to_whom was_given much, much will_be_being_sought from him, and to_whom they_entrusted they_will_be_requesting him much, more_abundantly.
\v 49 I_came to_throw Fire on the earth, and how I_am_wanting if it_was_ already _kindled?
\v 50 But I_am_having to_be_immersed immersion, and how I_am_being_pressed until of_which it_may_be_accomplished. 
\v 51 You_all_are_supposing that I_arrived to_give peace on the earth? No, I_am_saying to_you_all, but rather division.
\v 52 For/Because from the \add time\add* now will_be, five in one house having_been_divided, three against two, and two against three.
\v 53 father will_be_being_divided against son, and son against father, mother against daughter, and daughter against the mother, mother_in_law against the daughter-in-law of_her, and daughter-in-law against the mother_in_law.
\v 54 And he_was_saying also to_the crowds: Whenever you_all_may_see \add a\add*_cloud rising from \add the\add*_west, immediately you_all_are_saying, that \add A\add*_rainstorm is_coming, and it_is_becoming thus.
\v 55 And whenever \add a\add*_south_wind \add is\add* blowing, you_all_are_saying, that will_be scorching_heat, and it_is_becoming.
\v 56 Hypocrites. You_all_have_known \add how\add* to_be_approving the appearance of_the sky and of_the earth the but how you_all_have_ not _known to_be_scrutinizing this time?
\v 57 And why even for yourselves, you_all_are_ not _judging what \add is\add* right?
\v 58 For/Because as you_are_going with the opponent of_you before \add a\add*_ruler in the way, give effort to_have_released from him, lest he_may_be_dragging_ you _away to the judge, and the judge will_be_giving_ you _over to_the constable, and the constable will_be_throwing you into prison.
\v 59 I_am_saying to_you, by_no_means you_may_ not _come_out from_there until you_may_give_back even the last lepton_\add coin\add*.
\c 13
\v 1 And some were_being_present at \add the\add*_same the time, reporting to_him about the Galilaios, of_whom the blood Pilatos mixed with the sacrifices of_them.
\v 2 And answering he_said to_them: You_all_are_supposing that the these Galilaios, became sinners beyond all the Galilaios, because such they_have_suffered?
\v 3 No, I_am_saying to_you_all, but if you_all_may_ not _be_repenting, all will_be_perishing likewise.
\v 4 Or those the eighteen on whom the tower in the Silōam fell and killed_ them _off, are_you_all_supposing that they became debtors beyond all the people which dwelling_in Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim)?
\v 5 No, I_am_saying to_you_all, but if you_all_may_ not _be_repenting, all will_be_perishing likewise.
\v 6 And he_was_speaking this the parable: Someone was_having \add a\add*_fig_tree having_been_planted in the vineyard of_him, and he_came seeking fruit on it, and he_ not _found \add any\add*.
\v 7 And he_said to the Vinedresser, see three, years from that I_am_coming seeking fruit on the this fig_tree, and I_am_ not _finding \add any\add*. cut_ it _off, because/for_ why _reason it_is_ even _wasting the ground?
\v 8 And he answering is_saying to_him: Master, allow it also this the year, until of_which I_may_dig around it and I_may_put manure, 
\v 9 and_if on_one_hand it_may_produce fruit in the \add time\add* coming, on_the_other_hand if not surely you_will_be_cutting_ it _off.
\v 10 And he_was teaching in one of_the synagogues on the days_of_rest.
\v 11 And see, \add a\add*_woman having \add a\add*_spirit of_sickness eighteen years, and she_was bending_over and not being_able to_straighten_up to the full_extent.
\v 12 And having_seen her, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* calling_out and said to_her: Woman, you_have_been_sent_away from_the sickness of_you.
\v 13 And he_laid_on his hands on_her, and immediately she_was_restored and was_glorifying the \nd god\nd*.
\v 14 But the synagogue_leader answering, resenting because the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* healed on_the day_of_rest, he_was_saying to_the crowd, because Six days are in which it_is_fitting to_be_working, therefore coming in them be_being_healed, and not on_the day of_the day_of_rest.
\v 15 And the \nd master\nd* answered to_him and said: Hypocrites. Is_ not _untying each of_you_all the ox of_him, on_the day_of_rest, or the donkey from the manger, and having_led_away \add it\add* is_giving_to_drink \add it\add*?
\v 16 And this being daughter of_Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām), whom the Satan/(Sāţān) bound, see, ten and eight years, it_was_ not _fitting to_be_untied/released from the this bond on_the day of_the day_of_rest?
\v 17 And saying of_him these \add things\add*, all the \add ones\add* opposing to_him were_being_disgraced, and all the crowd was_rejoicing at all the glorious \add things\add* which becoming by him.
\v 18 Therefore he_was_saying: To_what is the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* similar, and to_what I_will_be_likening it?
\v 19 It_is similar to_\add a\add*_seed of_mustard, which \add a\add*_man having_taken, throw into garden of_himself, and it_grew and became into \add a\add*_tree, and The birds of_the sky nested in the branches of_it.
\v 20 And again he_said: To_what I_will_be_likening the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*?
\v 21 It_is similar to_leaven, which \add a\add*_woman having_taken, hid_in in three satons of_wheat_flour, until all of_which was_leavened.
\v 22 And he_was_passing_ by _through cities and villages teaching, and making journey toward Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim).
\v 23 And someone said to_him: \nd master\nd*, if the \add ones\add* being_saved \add are\add* few? And he said to them,
\v 24 Be_striving to_come_in through the narrow door, because I_am_saying to_you_all many, will_be_seeking to_come_in and they_˓will˒_ not _be_able.
\v 25 From what \add time\add* the \add the\add*_home_owner wishfully may_be_raised and may_shut the door, and you_all_may_begin to_have_stood outside and to_be_knocking the door saying: Master, open_up to_us, and answering he_will_be_saying to_you_all: I_have_ not _known you_all, from_where you_all_are.
\v 26 Then you_will_be_beginning to_be_saying: We_ate and we_drank before of_you, and you_taught in the roads of_us.
\v 27 And he_will_be_speaking, saying to_you_all: I_have_ not _known from_where you_all_are, withdraw from me, all workers of_unrighteousness.
\v 28 There will_be the weeping and the grating of_ the _teeth, whenever you_all_may_see Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām), and Isaʼak/(Yiʦḩāq), and Yakōb/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), and all the prophets, in the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*, but you_all being_thrown_out out.
\v 29 And they_will_be_coming from \add the\add*_east and \add the\add*_west and from \add the\add*_north and \add the\add*_south, and they_will_be_being_reclined in the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 30 And see, there_are last \add ones\add* who will_be first \add ones\add*, and there_are first \add ones\add* who will_be last \add ones\add*.
\v 31 In same the hour some Farisaios_\add party\add* approached saying to_him: Come_out and be_going from_here, because Haʸrōdaʸs is_wanting to_kill_ you _off.
\v 32 And he_said to_them: Having_been_gone say to_the this fox: Behold, I_am_throwing_out demons, and I_am_finishing_out healings today and tomorrow, and on_the third \add day\add* I_am_being_perfected.
\v 33 However it_is_fitting me, to_be_going today and tomorrow and on_the \add day\add* following, because it_is_ not _permitting \add a\add*_prophet to_perish outside Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim).
\v 34 Hierousalaʸm, Hierousalaʸm, the \add city\add* killing_off the prophets, and throwing_stones at_the \add ones\add* having_been_sent_out to her, how_often I_wanted to_gather_together the children of_you, that manner \add a\add*_hen \add gathers\add* the brood of_herself under her wings, and you_all_ not _wanted.
\v 35 Behold, the house of_you_all is_being_left \add desolate\add* to_you_all. And I_am_saying to_you_all, by_no_means you_all_may_ not _see me until you_all_may_say: Having_been_blessed \add is\add* the \add one\add* coming in \add the\add*_name of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd*.
\c 14
\v 1 And it_became at the \add time\add* him to_come into \add a\add*_house of_one of_the rulers Farisaios_\add party\add*, on_\add a\add*_day_of_rest to_eat bread, and they were watching_ him _closely.
\v 2 And see, \add a\add*_ certain _man was dropsical before him.
\v 3 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* answering spoke to the lawyers and to_\add the\add*_Farisaios_\add party\add* saying: Is_it_permitting on_the day_of_rest to_heal or not?
\v 4 But they kept_quiet. And having_taken_hold \add of_him\add*, he_healed him and sent_away \add him\add*.
\v 5 And he_said to them: Of_which of_you_all \add a\add*_son or \add an\add*_ox into \add a\add*_pit will_be_falling, and not immediately he_will_be_pulling_ him _up on \add the\add*_day of_the day_of_rest?
\v 6 And they_were_ not _able to_be_answered_back to these \add things\add*.
\v 7 And he_was_speaking \add a\add*_parable to the \add ones\add* having_been_invited, noticing how they_were_choosing the best_places, saying to them,
\v 8 Whenever you_may_be_called by anyone to wedding_festivities, you_may_ not _be_reclining in the best_place, lest \add one\add* more_honoured \add than\add* you may_be having_been_called by him,
\v 9 and having_come, the \add one\add* having_invited you and him he_will_be_saying to_you: Give to_this \add one\add* \add your\add*_place, and then you_may_begin to_be_keeping the last place with shame.
\v 10 But whenever you_may_be_called, having_been_gone sit_down in the last place, in_order_that whenever the \add one\add* having_invited you may_come he_will_be_saying to_you: Friend, move_up higher. Then glory will_be to_you before all the \add ones\add* reclining with_you.
\v 11 Because everyone the \add one\add* exalting himself will_be_being_humbled, and the \add one\add* humbling himself will_be_being_exalted.
\v 12 And he_was_ also _saying to_the \add one\add* having_invited him: Whenever you_may_be_making \add a\add*_dinner or \add a\add*_supper, be_ not _calling the friends of_you, nor the brothers of_you, nor the relatives of_you, nor your_ rich _neighbors, lest also they may_invite_back you and \add a\add*_repayment may_become to_you.
\v 13 But whenever you_may_be_making \add a\add*_banquet be_calling \add the\add*_poor, \add the\add*_crippled, \add the\add*_lame, \add the\add*_blind,
\v 14 and you_will_be blessed, because they_are_ not _having to_repay to_you, because/for will_be_being_repaid to_you in the resurrection of_the righteous.
\v 15 And one of_the \add ones\add* reclining having_heard these \add things\add*, said to_him: Blessed \add is_he\add* who will_be_eating bread in the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 16 But he said to_him: \add A\add*_man certain was_making \add a\add*_ great _supper, and invited many.
\v 17 And he_sent_out the slave of_him at_the hour of_the supper to_say to_the \add ones\add* having_been_invited: Be_coming, because it_is now ready.
\v 18 And all began of one to_be_excusing \add themselves\add*. The first said to_him: I_bought \add a\add*_field and I_am_having necessity having_come_out to_see it, I_am_asking you be_holding me having_been_excused.
\v 19 And another \add one\add* said: I_bought five pairs of_oxen and I_am_going to_approve them, I_am_asking you be_holding me having_been_excused.
\v 20 And another said, I_married \add a\add*_wife and because_of this I_am_ not _being_able to_come.
\v 21 And having_arrived, the slave reported these \add things\add* to_the master of_him. Then having_been_angered, the \add the\add*_home_owner said to_the slave of_him: Come_out quickly into the roads and streets of_the city, and bring_in here the poor, and crippled, and blind, and lame.
\v 22 And the slave said: Master, it_has_become what you_commanded, and still there_is place.
\v 23 And the master said to the slave: Come_out into the roads and fences, and compel \add them\add* to_come_in, in_order_that the house of_me may_be_filled, 
\v 24 for/because I_am_saying to_you_all that no_one of_ the those _men which having_been_invited, will_be_tasting of_the supper of_me.
\v 25 And great crowds were_going_with to_him, and having_been_turned, he_said to them,
\v 26 If anyone is_coming to me, and is_ not _hating the father of_himself, and the mother, and the wife, and the children, and the brothers, and the sisters, and still also the life of_himself, is_ not _able to_be \add a\add*_apprentice/follower of_me.
\v 27 Whoever not is_bearing the stake of_him and is_coming after me, is_ not _able to_be \add a\add*_apprentice/follower of_me.
\v 28 For/Because which of you_all wanting to_build \add a\add*_tower, not first having_sat_down, is_counting the cost, whether he_is_having \add enough\add* for \add the\add*_completion?
\v 29 In_order_that lest having_laid \add a\add*_foundation of_it and not being_able to_finish \add it\add*, all which observing \add it\add* may_begin to_be_mocking at_him
\v 30 saying, that This the man began to_be_building, and was_ not _able to_finish \add it\add*.
\v 31 Or what king going to_encounter with_another king in war, not having_sat_down first will_be_counselling whether he_is powerful with ten thousands to_meet with_the \add one\add* with twenty thousands coming against him?
\v 32 And if not surely still of_him being far_away, having_sent_out \add a\add*_delegation is_asking peace.
\v 33 Therefore thus everyone of you_all who is_ not _bidding_goodbye to_all the \add things\add* possessing of_himself, is_ not _able to_be \add a\add*_apprentice/follower of_me.
\v 34 Therefore the salt \add is\add* good, but if the salt may_be_made_tasteless, with what it_will_be_being_seasoned?
\v 35 It_is neither suitable for soil nor for manure, they_are_throwing it out. The \add one\add* having ears to_be_hearing, let_him_be_hearing.
\c 15
\v 1 And all the tax_collectors and the sinners were nearing to_him to_be_hearing from_him.
\v 2 And both the Farisaios_\add party\add* and the scribes were_grumbling saying, that This \add man\add* is_accepting sinners and is_eating_with with_them.
\v 3 And he_said to them the this parable saying,
\v 4 What person of you_all, having \add a\add*_hundred sheep and having_lost one of them, is_ not _leaving the ninety nine in the wilderness, and is_going after the \add sheep\add* having_lost, until he_may_find it?
\v 5 And having_found \add it\add*, he_is_laying_on \add it\add* on the shoulders of_him rejoicing.
\v 6 And having_come to the \add the\add*_house, he_is_calling_together his friends and his neighbors, saying to_them: Be_rejoicing_with with_me, because I_found the sheep of_me which having_been_lost. 
\v 7 I_am_saying to_you_all that thus joy in the heaven will_be over one sinner repenting, than over ninety nine righteous \add ones\add*, who are_having no need of_repentance.
\v 8 Or what woman having ten drachmas, if she_may_lose one drachma, is_ not _lighting \add a\add*_lamp, and is_sweeping the house, and is_seeking carefully, until of_which she_may_find \add it\add*?
\v 9 And having_found \add it\add*, is_calling_together her friends and neighbors saying: Be_rejoicing_with with_me, because I_found the drachma that I_lost.
\v 10 Thus I_am_saying to_you_all, there_is_becoming joy before the messengers of_ the _\nd god\nd* over one sinner repenting.
\v 11 And he_said: \add A\add*_ certain _man was_having two sons.
\v 12 And the younger of_them said to_the father: father, give to_me the breaking_down portion of_the estate. he and he_divided the living to_them.
\v 13 And after not many days having_gathered_together all \add things\add*, the younger son travelled into \add a\add*_ distant _country, and there scattered the estate of_him, living intemperately.
\v 14 But having_spent all \add things\add* of_him, there_became \add a\add*_ mighty _famine throughout the that country, and he began to_be_being_deficient.
\v 15 And having_been_gone, he_was_joined_together to_one of_the citizens of_ the that _country, and he_sent him into the fields of_him to_be_feeding pigs.
\v 16 And he_was_desiring to_be_satisfied from the carob_pods which the pigs were_eating, and no_one was_giving to_him.
\v 17 To but himself having_come he_was_saying: How_many hired \add ones\add* of_the father of_me are_being_plentiful of_bread, but I am_perishing with_famine here?
\v 18 Having_risen_up, I_will_be_going to the father of_me, and I_will_be_saying to_him: father, I_sinned against the heaven and before you,
\v 19 I_am no_longer worthy to_be_called \add the\add*_son of_you. Make me as one of_the hired \add ones\add* of_you.
\v 20 And having_risen_up, he_came to the father of_himself. But still being_ far _away from_him, the father of_him saw him, and was_feeling_compassion, and having_run, embraced on the neck of_him and kissed him.
\v 21 And the son said to_him: father, I_sinned against the heaven and before you, I_am no_longer worthy to_be_called \add a\add*_son of_you.
\v 22 But the father said to the slaves of_him: Quickly bring_out the first robe, and dress_ him _in, and give \add a\add*_ring for the hand of_him, and sandals for his feet,
\v 23 and be_bringing the the grain_fed calf, sacrifice \add it\add*, and having_eaten we_may_be_gladdened.
\v 24 Because this the son of_me was dead and revived, was having_been_lost and was_found. And they_began to_be_being_gladdened.
\v 25 And the the elder son of_him was in \add the\add*_field, and while coming, he_neared to_the house, he_heard of_music and dancing.
\v 26 And having_called_to one of_the servants, he_was_inquiring what wishfully might_be these \add things\add*.
\v 27 And he said to_him, that The brother of_you is_coming, and the father of_you sacrificed the the grain_fed calf, because he_took_back being_sound him.
\v 28 But he_was_angered and he_was_ not _wanting to_come_in. And the father of_him having_come_out, was_imploring him.
\v 29 And he answering said to_the father of_him: Behold, so_many years I_am_serving for_you, and I_ never _passed_by \add a\add*_command of_you, and you_ never _gave \add a\add*_young_goat, to_me, in_order_that I_may_be_gladdened with the friends of_me.
\v 30 But when the this son of_you, he_came which having_devoured the living of_you with prostitutes, you_sacrificed the grain_fed calf for_him. 
\v 31 And he said to_him: Child, you are always with me, and all the \add things\add* mine \add is\add* is yours.
\v 32 But it_was_fitting to_be_gladdened also to_be_elated, because the this brother of_you, was dead and lived \add again\add*, and having_lost and he_was_found.
\c 16
\v 1 And he_was_saying also to the apprentices/followers: \add A\add*_ certain _man was rich, who was_having \add a\add*_manager, and this \add one\add* was_accused to_him as scattering the \add things\add* possessing of_him.
\v 2 And having_called him, he_said to_him: What \add is\add* this I_am_hearing concerning you? Give_back the account of_the management of_you, because/for you_are_ not _being_able anymore to_be_managing.
\v 3 And the manager said by himself: What may_I_do, because the master of_me is_taking_away the management from me? I_am_ not _able To_be_digging, I_am_being_ashamed to_be_begging.
\v 4 I_knew what I_may_do, in_order_that whenever I_may_be_removed from the management, they_may_receive me into the homes of_them.
\v 5 And having_called_to each one of_the debtors of_the master of_himself, he_was_saying to_the first: How_much you_are_owing to_the master of_me?
\v 6 And he said: \add A\add*_hundred batos/(bat)_\add measures\add* of_olive_oil. And he said to_him: Receive of_you the bills and having_sat_down quickly write fifty.
\v 7 Then to_another he_said: And how_much are_ you _owing? And he said: \add A\add*_hundred koros/(kor)_\add measures\add* of_wheat. He_is_saying to_him: Receive of_you the bills and write eighty.
\v 8 And the master praised the manager of_ the _unrighteousness, because he_performed prudently. Because the sons of_ the this _age are more_prudently beyond the sons of_the light in the generation which of_themselves.
\v 9 And I am_saying to_you_all, make friends for_yourselves by the money of_ the _unrighteousness, in_order_that whenever it_may_fail, they_may_receive you_all into the eternal dwellings.
\v 10 The \add one\add* faithful with \add the\add*_least, is also faithful with much, and the \add one\add* unrighteous with \add the\add*_least, is also unrighteous with much.
\v 11 Therefore if you_all_became not faithful with the unrighteous money, who will_be_entrusting the true \add wealth\add* to_you_all?
\v 12 And if you_all_became not faithful with the stranger, who will_be_giving the_ your _\add things\add* to_you_all?
\v 13 Not_one house_servant is_able to_be_serving for_two masters, because/for either he_will_be_hating the one, and the other he_will_be_loving, or of_\add the\add*_one he_will_be_upholding, and of_the other he_will_be_despising. You_all_are_ not _being_able to_be_serving for_\nd god\nd* and money.
\v 14 And all the Farisaios_\add party\add* were_hearing these \add things\add*, being money_lovers, and they_were_sneering_at him.
\v 15 And he_said to_them: You_all are the \add ones\add* justifying yourselves before the people, but the \nd god\nd* is_knowing the hearts of_you_all, because the \add thing\add* exalted among people, \add an\add*_abomination \add is\add* before the \nd god\nd*.
\v 16 The law and the prophets \add were\add* until Yōannaʸs, from then the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* is_being_good_message_preached, and everyone is_forcing into it.
\v 17 But it_is easier the for_heaven and the earth to_pass_away, than one serif of_the law to_fall.
\v 18 Everyone which sending_away the wife of_him and marrying another, is_committing_adultery, and every the \add one\add* marrying having_been_sent_away from \add a\add*_husband, is_committing_adultery.
\v 19 And \add a\add*_ certain _man was rich, and was_dressing_in purple and linen, being_gladdened splendidly in_every day.
\v 20 And \add a\add*_ certain _poor \add man\add* by_\add the\add*_name Lazaros, had_been_laid at the gate of_him, having_been_ulcerated
\v 21 and desiring to_be_satisfied from which which falling falling from the table of_the rich \add man\add*, but even the dogs coming were_licking_up the ulcers of_him.
\v 22 And it_became the poor \add man\add* to_die_off, and him to_be_carried_away by the messengers into the bosom of_Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām). And the rich \add man\add* died_off also and was_buried.
\v 23 And in the Haidaʸs having_lifted_up the eyes of_him, being in torments, he_is_seeing Abraʼam from afar, and Lazaros in the bosoms of_him.
\v 24 And he having_called said, father Abraʼam, show_mercy to_me and send Lazaros, in_order_that he_may_dip the extremity of_the finger of_him in_water, and may_cool_down the tongue of_me, because I_am_being_distressed in the this flame.
\v 25 But Abraʼam said: Child, be_reminded that you_took_back the good of_you in the life of_you, and Lazaros likewise the evil. But now here he_is_being_comforted, and you are_being_distressed.
\v 26 And among all these \add things\add*, between us and you_all \add a\add*_chasm great has_been_established, so_that the \add ones\add* wanting to_pass_through here to you_all may_ not _be_able, nor may_be_crossing_over from_there to us.
\v 27 And, he_said, therefore I_am_asking you father, that you_may_send him to the house of_the father of_me,
\v 28 for/because I_am_having five brothers, so_that he_may_be_testifying to_them, in_order_that they may_ not also _come to the this place of_ the _torment.
\v 29 But Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām) is_saying: They_are_having Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) and the prophets, them_let_hear from_them.
\v 30 And he said: No, father Abraʼam, but if someone from \add the\add*_dead may_be_gone to them, they_will_be_repenting.
\v 31 But he_said to_him: If they_are_ not _hearing from_Mōsaʸs and the prophets, not_even if someone from \add the\add*_dead may_rise_up, they_will_be_being_persuaded.
\c 17
\v 1 And he_said to the apprentices/followers of_him: It_is impossible of_which the temptations to_ not _come, however woe \add to_him\add* by whom it_is_coming. 
\v 2 It_is_improving for_him if \add a\add*_ milling _stone is_hung_around around the neck of_him, and he_has_been_thrown_down into the sea, than that he_may_stumble of_ the one these _little \add ones\add*.
\v 3 Be_taking_heed to_yourselves. If the brother of_you may_sin, give_rebuke to_him, and if he_may_repent, forgive to_him.
\v 4 And if he_may_sin against you seven_times in_the day, and seven_times he_may_return to you, saying I_am_repenting, you_will_be_forgiving to_him.
\v 5 And the ambassadors said to_the \nd master\nd*: Add faith to_us. 
\v 6 And the \nd master\nd* said: If you_all_are_having faith as \add a\add*_seed of_mustard, you_all_ would _were_saying to_ the _mulberry_tree this: Be_uprooted and be_planted in the sea, and it_ would _submitted to_you_all.
\v 7 And which of you_all having \add a\add*_slave, plowing or shepherding, who having_come_in out_of the field will_be_saying to_him: Having_come_up immediately sit_down \add to_eat\add*?
\v 8 But not he_will_be_saying to_him: Prepare what I_may_dine, and having_girded_about be_serving unto_me, until I_may_eat and I_may_drink, and after these \add things\add* you will_be_eating and will_be_drinking?
\v 9 Is_ not _having thankfulness to_the slave, because he_did the \add things\add* having_been_directed?
\v 10 Thus also you_all whenever you_all_may_do all the \add things\add* having_been_directed to_you_all, be_saying, we_are that Useless slaves, we_have_done what we_were_ought to_do.
\v 11 And it_became at the \add time\add* to_be_going to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and because_of he was_passing_through \add the\add*_midst of_Samareia/(Shomrōn) and Galilaia/(Gālīl).
\v 12 And on_coming_in of_him into \add a\add*_certain village, met ten leprous men, who stood from_afar.
\v 13 And they lifted_up \add their\add*_voice saying: \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, master, show_mercy to_us.
\v 14 And having_seen \add them\add*, he_said to_them: Having_been_gone show yourselves to_the priests. And it_became at the \add time\add* to_be_going to_them, they_were_cleansed.
\v 15 And one of them having_seen that he_was_healed, returned with \add a\add*_ loud _voice glorifying the \nd god\nd*,
\v 16 and he_fell on \add his\add*_face before the feet of_him, giving_thanks to_him, and he was \add a\add*_from_Samareia/(Shomrōn).
\v 17 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering said: ˓Were˒_ not _cleansed the ten? But where \add are\add* the nine?
\v 18 Not were_they_found having_returned to_give glory to_ the _\nd god\nd*, except not/lest the this foreigner?
\v 19 And he_said to_him: Having_stood_up, be_going, the faith of_you has_healed you. 
\v 20 And having_been_asked by the Farisaios_\add party\add* when the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* is_coming, he_answered to_them and said, the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* Is_ not _coming with observation,
\v 21 nor ˓will˒_they_be_saying: Behold, here \add it_is\add*, or: There \add it_is\add*. For/Because see, the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* is inside of_you_all.
\v 22 And he_said to the apprentices/followers: Days will_be_coming when you_all_will_be_desiring to_see one of_the days of_the son of_ the _Man, and you_all_˓will˒_ not _be_seeing \add it\add*.
\v 23 And they_will_be_saying to_you_all: Behold, there \add he_is\add*, or: Behold, here \add he_is\add*, you_all_may_ not _go_away nor you_all_may_pursue.
\v 24 For/Because as the lightning flashing from the \add one_part\add* under the sky is_shining to the \add one_part\add* under sky, thus the son of_ the _man will_be.
\v 25 But first it_is_fitting him to_suffer many \add things\add*, and to_be_rejected by the this generation.
\v 26 And as it_became in the days of_Nōe/(Noaḩ), thus it_will_be also in the days of_the son of_ the _Man:
\v 27 they_were_eating, they_were_drinking, they_were_marrying, they_were_being_betrothed, until that day Nōe came_in into the box, and the flood came and destroyed all.
\v 28 Likewise as it_became in the days of_Lōt/(Lōţ): they_were_eating, they_were_drinking, they_were_buying, they_were_selling, they_were_planting, they_were_building, 
\v 29 but in_that day Lōt/(Lōţ) came_out from Sodoma/(Şədom), fire and brimstone rained from \add the\add*_sky and destroyed all.
\v 30 These \add things\add* it_will_be according_to in_that day, the son of_ the _man is_being_revealed.
\v 31 In that the day, who will_be on the housetop, and the goods of_him in his house, him_let_ not _come_down to_take_away them, and the \add one\add* in \add the\add*_field, likewise him_let_ not _return to the \add things\add* back.
\v 32 Be_remembering about_the wife of_Lōt/(Lōţ).
\v 33 Whoever if may_seek to_procure the life of_him, will_be_losing it, and whoever wishfully may_lose \add it\add*, will_be_keeping_ it _alive.
\v 34 I_am_saying to_you_all, in_this the night will_be two on one bed, the one will_be_being_taken, and the other will_be_being_left.
\v 35 Two will_be grinding at the same \add place\add*, the one will_be_being_taken, and the \add the\add*_other will_be_being_left.
\v 36
\v 37 And answering they_are_saying to_him: Where, \nd master\nd*? And he said to_them: Where the body \add is\add*, there also the vultures will_be_being_gathered_together.
\c 18
\v 1 And he_was_speaking \add a\add*_parable to_them, because/for the \add way\add* it_to_be_fitting always them to_be_praying and to_be_ not _losing_heart
\v 2 saying: \add A\add*_ certain _judge was in \add a\add*_certain city, not revering the \nd god\nd* and not being_swayed by_\add a\add*_person.
\v 3 And \add a\add*_widow was in the that city, and she_was_coming to him saying: Avenge me of the opponent of_me.
\v 4 And he_was_ not _willing for \add a\add*_time, but after these \add things\add* he_said to himself: Even if I_am_ not _revering the \nd god\nd* nor I_am_being_swayed \add a\add*_person,
\v 5 because_of this the widow which surely to_be_bringing_about trouble to_me, I_will_be_avenging her, in_order_that not coming to \add the\add*_end she_may_be_harassing me.
\v 6 And the \nd master\nd* said: Hear what the judge of_ the _unrighteousness is_saying.
\v 7 And the \nd god\nd* by_no_means may_ not _execute the vengeance of_the chosen of_him, which shouting to_him day and night, and is_being_patient over them?
\v 8 I_am_saying to_you_all that he_will_be_executing the vengeance of_them in quickness. However the son of_ the _man having_come, /anxiety/ ˓will˒_he_be_finding the faith on the earth?
\v 9 And he_ also _spoke the this parable to some which having_trusted in themselves that they_are righteous and scorning the others:
\v 10 Two men went_up into the temple to_pray, the one \add was\add* \add a\add*_Farisaios_\add party_member\add*, and the other \add was\add* \add a\add*_tax_collector.
\v 11 The Farisaios_\add party_member\add* having_been_stood was_praying these \add things\add* to himself: - \nd god\nd*, I_am_giving_thanks to_you that I_am not as the rest of_the people, swindling, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this the tax_collector.
\v 12 I_am_fasting twice of_ the _\add a\add*_week, I_am_tithing all \add things\add*, as_many_as I_am_acquiring.
\v 13 But the tax_collector having_stood afar, was_ not _willing not_even his eyes to_lift_up to the sky, but was_striking the chest of_him saying: - \nd god\nd*, be_made_atonement for_me, the sinner. 
\v 14 I_am_saying to_you_all, this \add one\add* came_down to the house of_him having_been_justified, contrary_to that \add one\add*. Because everyone which exalting himself will_be_being_humbled, but the \add one\add* humbling himself will_be_being_exalted.
\v 15 And they_were_ also _bringing the babies to_him, in_order_that he_may_be_touching against_them, but the apprentices/followers having_seen, were_giving_rebuke to_them.
\v 16 But the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* called_to them saying: Allow the little_children to_be_coming to me, and be_ not _forbidding them, because/for the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* is the of_such.
\v 17 Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all, whoever wishfully may_ not _receive the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* as \add a\add*_little_child, by_no_means may_ not _come_in into it.
\v 18 And \add a\add*_certain ruler asked him saying: Good Teacher, having_done what, I_will_be_inheriting life eternal?
\v 19 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_him: Why are_you_calling me good? No_one \add is\add* good, except not/lest one the \nd god\nd*.
\v 20 You_have_known the commands: You_may_ not _commit_adultery, you_may_ not _murder, you_may_ not _steal, you_may_ not _give_false_testimony: Be_honouring the father and the mother of_you.
\v 21 And he said, I_kept all these \add things\add* from \add the\add*_youth of_me.
\v 22 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_heard, said to_him: Still one \add thing\add* is_lacking to_you, all as_much_as you_are_having, sell and distribute to_\add the\add*_poor, and you_will_be_having treasure in \add the\add*_heavens, and come, be_following after_me.
\v 23 But he having_heard these \add things\add*, was_become very_sorrowful, because/for he_was exceedingly rich.
\v 24 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_seen him, said: How difficultly the \add ones\add* having the wealth, will_be_coming_in into the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 25 For/Because is easier \add a\add*_camel to_come_in through \add an\add*_eye of_\add a\add*_needle, than \add a\add*_rich \add man\add* to_come_in into the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 26 And they having_heard said: And who is_able to_be_saved?
\v 27 But he said: The \add things\add* impossible with humans, is possible with the \nd god\nd*.
\v 28 And the Petros said: Behold, we left all \add things\add* and followed after_you.
\v 29 And he said to_them: Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that there_is no_one who left house, or wife, or brothers, or parents, or children, on_account the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*,
\v 30 who by_no_means may_ not _take_back many_times_more in the this time, and in the which coming age, eternal life.
\v 31 And having_taken the twelve, he_said to them: Behold, we_are_going_up to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and all the \add things\add* having_been_written by the prophets about_the son of_ the _man will_be_being_accomplished.
\v 32 For/Because he_will_be_being_given_over to_the pagans, and he_will_be_being_mocked, and he_will_be_being_insulted, and he_will_be_being_spat_on.
\v 33 And having_flogged \add him\add*, they_will_be_killing_ him _off, and on_the the third day, he_will_be_rising_up.
\v 34 And they understood nothing of_these \add things\add*, and the this message was having_been_hidden from them, and they_were_ not _knowing the \add things\add* being_spoken.
\v 35 And it_became at the \add time\add* him to_be_nearing, to Yeriⱪō/(Yərīḩō), \add a\add*_ certain _blind \add man\add* was_sitting beside the road begging.
\v 36 And having_heard of_\add a\add*_crowd passing_through, he_was_inquiring what this might_be.
\v 37 And they_reported to_him, that \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* the from_Nazaret is_passing_by.
\v 38 And he_shouted saying: \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, son of_Dawid/(Dāvid), show_mercy to_me.
\v 39 And the \add ones\add* going_before were_warning to_him that he_may_keep_silent. But he was_crying_out by_much more: son of_Dawid, show_mercy to_me.
\v 40 And \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_been_stopped, commanded him to_be_brought to him. And having_neared him, he_asked him,
\v 41 What you_are_wanting I_may_do for_you? And he said: \nd master\nd*, that I_may_receive_sight.
\v 42 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_him: Receive_sight, the faith of_you has_healed you.
\v 43 And immediately he_received_sight, and was_following after_him, glorifying the \nd god\nd*. And all the people having_seen \add it\add*, gave praise to_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\c 19
\v 1 And having_come_in, he_was_passing_through the Yeriⱪō.
\v 2 And see, \add a\add*_man being_called by_\add the\add*_name Zakⱪaios, and he was \add a\add*_chief_tax_collector, and he \add was\add* rich.
\v 3 And he_was_seeking to_see the who \nd Yaʸsous\nd* is, and was_ not _able because_of the crowd, because he_was the small in_stature.
\v 4 And having_run_ahead ahead, he_went_up in \add a\add*_sycamore_tree, in_order_that he_may_see him, because he_was_going to_be_passing_through of_that \add way\add*.
\v 5 And as he_came to the place, the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* having_looked_up, said to him: Zakⱪaios, having_hurried come_down, because/for today it_is_fitting me to_remain in the house of_you.
\v 6 And having_hurried, he_came_down and welcomed him rejoicing.
\v 7 And all having_seen \add it\add*, were_grumbling saying, that He_came_in to_lodge with \add a\add*_sinful man.
\v 8 And Zakⱪaios having_been_stood, said to the \nd master\nd*: Behold, the half of_the \add things\add* of_me possessing, \nd master\nd*, I_am_giving to_the poor, and if I_defrauded anything of_anyone, I_am_giving_back quadruple.
\v 9 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to him, that Today salvation this to_ the _house became, as_much_as he also is \add a\add*_son of_Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām).
\v 10 For/Because the son of_ the _man came to_seek and to_save the \add thing\add* having_been_lost.
\v 11 And from_them hearing these \add things\add* having_proceeded, he_said \add a\add*_parable because_of that him to_be near of_Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and them to_be_supposing that the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* is_ immediately _going to_be_being_appeared.
\v 12 Therefore, he_said, \add a\add*_ certain noble _man was_gone to \add a\add*_country distant, to_receive for_himself \add a\add*_kingdom and to_return.
\v 13 And having_called ten slaves of_himself, he_gave ten mnas\add _of_silver\add* to_them, and told to them: To_do_business at the \add time\add* I_am_coming.
\v 14 But the citizens of_him were_hating him, and they_sent_out \add a\add*_delegation after him saying: We_are_ not _willing this \add man\add* to_reign over us.
\v 15 And it_became on the \add way\add* of_him to_return, having_received the kingdom, and he_said the these slaves to_be_called to_him to_whom he_had_given the silver, in_order_that he_may_know what they_bartered.
\v 16 And the first arrived saying: Master, the mna\add _of_silver\add* of_you, additionally_earned ten. mnas\add _of_silver\add*.
\v 17 And he_said to_him: Well \add done\add* good slave. Because you_became faithful in least, be having authority over ten cities.
\v 18 And the second came saying: The mna\add _of_silver\add* of_you, master, made five mnas\add _of_silver\add*.
\v 19 And he_said also to_this \add one\add*: Also you be_becoming over five cities.
\v 20 And the another came saying: Master, see, the mna\add _of_silver\add* of_you, which I_was_having lying_away in \add a\add*_handkerchief.
\v 21 For/Because I_was_fearing you, because you_are \add a\add*_ austere _man, you_are_taking_up what you_ not _laid, and you_are_reaping what you_ not _sowed.
\v 22 He_is_saying to_him: I_will_be_judging you out_of the mouth of_you, evil slave. You_had_known that I am \add a\add*_ austere _man, taking_up what I_ not _laid, and reaping what I_ not _sowed?
\v 23 And for_ why _reason you_ not _gave the silver of_me to \add the\add*_bank, and_I having_come, I_collected wishfully it with interest?
\v 24 And to_the \add ones\add* having_stood_by he_said: Take_away the mna\add _of_silver\add* from him, and give \add it\add* to_the \add one\add*, having the ten mnas\add _of_silver\add*.
\v 25 And they_said to_him, master he_is_having Ten, mnas\add _of_silver\add* \add already\add*.
\v 26 I_am_saying to_you_all that to_everyone the \add one\add* having, will_be_being_given, but from the \add one\add* not having, even what he_is_having will_be_being_taken_away.
\v 27 However these the enemies of_me, the \add ones\add* not having_wanted me to_reign over them, bring here and strike_ them _down before me.
\v 28 And having_said these \add things\add* he_was_going ahead going_up to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim).
\v 29 And it_became as he_neared to Baʸthfagaʸ and Baʸthania, toward the mountain which being_called of_Olives, he_sent_out two of_the apprentices/followers
\v 30 saying: Be_going into the village ahead, in which entering_in you_all_will_be_finding \add a\add*_colt having_been_bound, on which no_one ever of_people sat_down, and having_untied it, bring \add it\add*.
\v 31 And if anyone may_be_asking you_all: for_ Why _reason you_all_are_untying \add it\add*? Thus you_all_will_be_saying, that The \nd master\nd* is_having need of_it.
\v 32 And having_gone_away they having_been_sent_out found \add it\add* as he_said to_them.
\v 33 And of_them releasing the colt, the masters of_it said to them: Why are_you_all_untying the colt?
\v 34 And they said, that The \nd master\nd* is_having need of_it.
\v 35 And they_led it to the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, and having_throw_on the clothes of_them on the colt, the they_mounted_ \nd Yaʸsous\nd* _\add on_it\add*.
\v 36 And of_him going, they_were_spreading_under the clothes of_themselves on the road.
\v 37 And of_him nearing already at the down_grade of_the Mount of_ the _Olives, all the multitude of_the apprentices/followers began rejoicing to_be_praising the \nd god\nd* with_\add a\add*_ loud _voice for all \add the\add*_miracles which they_saw
\v 38 saying: Having_been_blessed \add is\add* the king the \add one\add* coming, in \add the\add*_name of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, in heaven peace and glory in \add the\add*_highest.
\v 39 And some of_the Farisaios_\add party\add* from the crowd said to him: Teacher, give_rebuke to_the apprentices/followers of_you.
\v 40 And answering he_said: I_am_saying to_you_all that if these will_be_keeping_silent, the stones will_be_crying_out.
\v 41 And as he_neared, having_seen the city, he_wept over it
\v 42 saying, that If you_knew in the this day, even you, the \add things\add* for peace, but now it_was_hidden from \add the\add*_eyes of_you.
\v 43 Because days will_be_coming on you, and the enemies of_you will_be_throwing_around \add a\add*_palisade to_you, and they_will_be_surrounding you and they_will_be_pressing you on_every_side,
\v 44 and they_will_be_leveling you and the children of_you with you, and they_˓will˒_ not _be_leaving \add a\add*_stone on \add a\add*_stone with you, instead_of which you_ not _knew the season of_the visitation of_you.
\v 45 And having_come_in into the temple, he_began to_be_throwing_out the \add ones\add* selling,
\v 46 saying to_them: It_has_been_written: The house of_me \add will_be\add* \add a\add*_house of_prayer, but you_all made it \add a\add*_hideout of_robbers.
\v 47 And he_was teaching which in_every day in the temple, but the chief_priests and the scribes and the leaders of_the people were_seeking, to_destroy him,
\v 48 and they_were_ not _finding which what they_may_do, because/for the all \add the\add*_people was_hanging_on hearing of_him.
\c 20
\v 1 And it_became on one of_the days, of_ him _teaching the people in the temple, and good_message_preaching, the chief_priests and the scribes with the elders approached,
\v 2 and they_spoke saying to him: Tell to_us by what authority you_are_doing these \add things\add*, or who is the \add one\add* having_given this the authority to_you?
\v 3 And answering he_said to them: Also_I Will_be_asking you_all \add a\add*_message and tell to_me:
\v 4 the immersion of_Yōannaʸs, was_it from heaven or from humans?
\v 5 And they reasoned_together to themselves saying, that If we_may_say: From heaven, he_will_be_saying: for_ Why _reason you_all_ not _believed in_him?
\v 6 But if we_may_say: From humans, all the people will_be_stoning us, because/for having_been_persuaded Yōannaʸs he_is to_be \add a\add*_prophet.
\v 7 And they_answered, to_have_ not _known from_where.
\v 8 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_them: Neither am_ I _telling to_you_all by what authority I_am_doing these \add things\add*.
\v 9 And he_began to_be_speaking this the parable to the people: \add A\add*_man planted \add a\add*_vineyard, and rented_out it to_tenant_farmers, and travelled many times.
\v 10 And in_\add the\add*_season he_sent_out \add a\add*_slave to the tenant_farmers, in_order_that they_will_be_giving to_him from the fruit of_the vineyard. But the tenant_farmers having_beat \add him\add* sent_ him _away, empty-handed.
\v 11 And he_proceeded to_send another slave, but they, having_beat and having_dishonoured also_that \add one\add*, they_sent_away \add him\add* empty-handed.
\v 12 And he_proceeded to_send \add a\add*_third, and they also having_wounded this \add one\add*, throw_out \add him\add*.
\v 13 And the master of_the vineyard said: What may_I_do? I_will_be_sending the the beloved son of_me, perhaps they_will_be_being_swayed by_this \add one\add*.
\v 14 But having_seen him, the tenant_farmers were_reasoning to one_another saying: This is the heir, we_may_kill_ him _off, in_order_that the inheritance may_become of_us.
\v 15 And having_throw_ him _out outside the vineyard, they_killed_off \add him\add*. Therefore what ˓will˒_ the master of_the vineyard _be_doing to_them?
\v 16 He_will_be_coming and will_be_destroying the these tenant_farmers, and will_be_giving the vineyard to_others. And having_heard they_said: Never might_it_become. 
\v 17 But he having_focused_in on_them said: Therefore what is this the \add message\add* having_been_written: \add The\add*_stone which the \add ones\add* building rejected, this was_become for \add the\add*_head of_\add the\add*_corner?
\v 18 Everyone which having_fallen on that the stone, will_be_being_shattered, but on whomever wishfully it_may_fall, it_will_be_pulverizing him.
\v 19 And the scribes and the chief_priests sought to_lay_on their hands on him, in \add the\add*_same the hour, and they_were_afraid the people, because/for they_knew that he_spoke the this parable against them.
\v 20 And having_watched_closely, they_sent_out spies pretending themselves to_be righteous, in_order_that they_may_catch of_him \add a\add*_statement, so_that to_give_ him _over to_the rule and the authority of_the governor.
\v 21 And they_asked him saying: Teacher, we_have_known that you_are_saying correctly, and you_are_teaching, and you_are_ not _receiving \add any\add*_person, but you_are_teaching the way of_ the _\nd god\nd* in truth.
\v 22 Is_it_permitting for_us to_give tax to_Kaisar or not?
\v 23 But having_observed the craftiness of_them, he_said to them,
\v 24 Show to_me \add the\add*_daʸnarion_\add coin\add*, of_whose image and inscription is_it_having? and they said: Of_Kaisar.
\v 25 And he he_said to them: So_now give_back the \add things\add* of_Kaisar to_Kaisar, and the \add things\add* of_ the _\nd god\nd* to_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 26 And they_were_ not _able to_catch of_the \add one\add* in_\add a\add*_message before the people, and having_marvelled at the answer of_him, they_kept_silent.
\v 27 And some of_the Saddoukaios_\add sect\add*, the \add ones\add* saying there_ not _to_be \add a\add*_resurrection having_approached, asked him
\v 28 saying: Teacher, Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) wrote to_us: If brother of_anyone may_die_off having \add a\add*_wife, and this \add one\add* childless in_order_that the brother of_him may_take the wife, and may_raise_up seed to_the brother of_him.
\v 29 Therefore there_were seven brothers, and the first, having_taken \add a\add*_wife, died_off childless, 
\v 30 and the second,
\v 31 and the third took her, and likewise also the seven, not left children, and they_died_off.
\v 32 Last the woman also died_off.
\v 33 Therefore in the resurrection, of_which of_them is_she_becoming wife? For/Because the seven had her as_wife.
\v 34 And the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* said to_them: The sons the this of_age are_marrying and are_being_betrothed,
\v 35 but the \add ones\add* having_been_considered_worthy that of_ the _age, to_obtain and of_the resurrection which \add is\add* from \add the\add*_dead, are_ neither _marrying nor are_being_betrothed, 
\v 36 for/because they_are_ not _being_able to_die_off anymore, because/for/because they_are messenger-like, and they_are sons of_\nd god\nd*, being sons of_the resurrection.
\v 37 But that the dead are_being_raised, even Mōsaʸs divulged at the thorn_bush, when he_is_calling \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*: the \nd god\nd* of_Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām), and \add the\add*_\nd god\nd* of_Isaʼak/(Yiʦḩāq), and \add the\add*_\nd god\nd* of_Yakōb/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ).
\v 38 And \nd god\nd* is not of_\add the\add*_dead, but of_\add the\add*_living, because/for to_him all are_living.
\v 39 And some of_the scribes answering said: Teacher, you_spoke well.
\v 40 for/because They_were_ no_longer _daring to_be_asking him nothing.
\v 41 And he_said to them: How are_they_saying the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* to_be son of_Dawid/(Dāvid)?
\v 42 For/Because Dawid himself is_saying in \add the\add*_scroll of_psalms: the \nd master\nd* Said to_the \nd master\nd* of_me: Be_sitting on \add the\add*_right of_me,
\v 43 until wishfully I_may_put the enemies of_you as_\add a\add*_footstool of_the feet of_you.
\v 44 Therefore Dawid, is_calling him \nd master\nd*, and how is_he son of_him?
\v 45 And all the people hearing, he_said to_the apprentices/followers of_him,
\v 46 Be_taking_heed of the scribes which wanting to_be_walking in robes, and loving greetings in the marketplaces, and \add the\add*_best_seats in the synagogues, and \add the\add*_best_places at the suppers,
\v 47 who are_devouring the houses of_the widows, and they_are_praying long for_\add a\add*_under_pretense. These will_be_receiving more_abundant judgment.
\c 21
\v 1 And having_looked_up, he_saw \add the\add*_rich the \add ones\add* throwing the gifts of_them into the treasury.
\v 2 And he_saw \add a\add*_certain poor widow, throwing two leptons. there.
\v 3 And he_said: Truly I_am_saying to_you_all that the this the poor widow, throw more \add than\add* all, 
\v 4 for/because all these throw in their gifts out_of the \add wealth\add* being_plentiful to_them, but this \add woman\add* throw out_of the need of_her, all the living which she_was_having.
\v 5 And as_some speaking about the temple that has_been_adorned with_ good _stones and with_offerings, he_said,
\v 6 These \add things\add* which you_all_are_observing, days will_be_coming in which stone ˓will˒_ not _be_being_left on stone, here, which ˓will˒_ not _be_being_torn_down.
\v 7 And they_asked him saying: Teacher, therefore when \add things\add* these will_be, and what the sign whenever these \add things\add* may_be_going to_be_becoming?
\v 8 And he said: Be_watching_out, lest you_all_may_be_strayed, because/for many will_be_coming in the name of_me saying: I am \add he\add*, and: The time has_neared. You_all_may_ not _be_gone after them.
\v 9 And whenever you_all_may_hear wars and disturbances, you_all_may_ not _be_terrified, because/for it_is_fitting these \add things\add* to_become first, but the end not \add is\add* immediately.
\v 10 Then he_was_saying to_them: Nation will_be_being_raised against nation, and kingdom against kingdom,
\v 11 both great earthquakes, and in \add different\add* places, will_be famines and pestilences, and fearful_sights and from \add the\add*_sky will_be great signs
\v 12 But before all these \add things\add*, they_will_be_laying_on on you_all the hands of_them, and they_will_be_persecuting, giving_over to the synagogues and prisons, being_led_away before kings and governors, on_account the name of_me.
\v 13 it_will_be_turning_out \add a\add*_testimony for to_you_all.
\v 14 Therefore purpose in the hearts of_you_all not to_be_premeditating to_be_defended,
\v 15 for/because I will_be_giving \add a\add*_mouth and wisdom to_you_all, to_which they_˓will˒_ not _be_able to_resist or to_speak_against all the \add ones\add* opposing to_you_all.
\v 16 But you_all_will_be_being_given_over even by parents, and brothers, and relatives, and friends, and they_will_be_putting_to_death \add some\add* from you_all.
\v 17 And you_all_will_be being_hated by all because_of the name of_me.
\v 18 But \add a\add*_hair of the head of_you_all, by_no_means may_ not _perish.
\v 19 By the endurance of_you_all, you_all_will_be_acquiring the lives of_you_all.
\v 20 But whenever you_all_may_see Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) being_surrounded by armies, then know that the desolation of_her has_neared.
\v 21 Then the \add ones\add* in the Youdaia, let_them_be_fleeing to the mountains, and the \add ones\add* in midst of_her, let_them_be_departing_out, and the \add ones\add* in the countries, them_let_ not _be_coming_in into her.
\v 22 Because these are days of_vengeance which to_be_fulfilled all the \add things\add* having_been_written.
\v 23 And woe to_the \add women\add* having \add child\add* in womb and to_the \add women\add* nursing in those the days, because/for will_be great hardship on the land, and severe_anger the on_ this _people.
\v 24 And they_will_be_falling by_\add the\add*_edge of_\add the\add*_sword, and they_will_be_being_made_captive into all the nations, and Hierousalaʸm will_be being_trodden by \add the\add*_pagans, until of_which \add the\add*_times of_\add the\add*_pagans may_be_fulfilled.
\v 25 And there_will_be signs in \add the\add*_sun, and moon, and stars, and anguish of_nations on the earth, with perplexity of_\add the\add*_sound of_\add the\add*_sea and surf,
\v 26 people fainting from fear and expectation of_the \add things\add* coming_over to_the inhabited_world, because/for the powers of_the heavens will_be_being_shaken.
\v 27 And then they_will_be_seeing the son of_ the _Man, coming in \add a\add*_cloud with power and great glory.
\v 28 But these \add things\add* beginning to_be_becoming, straighten_up and lift_up the heads of_you_all, because the redemption of_you_all is_nearing.
\v 29 And he_said parable to_them: Watch the fig_tree and all the trees, 
\v 30 whenever they_may_put_forward already, seeing \add them\add* for yourselves, you_all_are_knowing that already the summer is near.
\v 31 Thus also you_all, whenever you_all_may_see these \add things\add* becoming, be_knowing that the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* is near.
\v 32 Truly, I_am_saying to_you_all that by_no_means may_ not _pass_away the this generation, until wishfully all \add things\add* may_become.
\v 33 The heaven and the earth will_be_passing_away, but the messages of_me by_no_means ˓will˒_ not _be_passing_away.
\v 34 And be_taking_heed to_yourselves, lest the hearts of_you_all may_be_weighed_down with dissipation, and drunkenness, and worries of_living, and that sudden the day may_approach on you_all
\v 35 as \add a\add*_snare, because/for it_will_be_coming_in on all the \add ones\add* sitting on \add the\add*_face of_all the earth.
\v 36 Be_watching and at every season, beseeching that you_all_may_prevail to_escape all these \add things\add* which going to_be_becoming, and to_be_stood before the son of_ the _Man.
\v 37 And he_was teaching in the temple in_the days, but the in_\add the\add*_nights coming_out, he_was_lodging on the mountain which being_called of_Olives.
\v 38 And all the people was_coming_at_dawn to him in the temple to_be_hearing from_him.
\c 22
\v 1 And the feast of_ the _non-fermented \add bread\add*, which being_called \add the\add*_passover_\add feast\add* was_nearing.
\v 2 And the chief_priests and the scribes were_seeking, the \add way\add* how they_may_kill him, because/for they_were_fearing the people.
\v 3 And Satan/(Sāţān) came_in into Youdas/(Yəhūdāh), the \add one\add* being_called Iskariōtaʸs, being of the number of_the twelve.
\v 4 And having_gone_away, he_conversed_with with_the chief_priests and officers, the \add way\add* how he_may_give_ him _over to_them.
\v 5 And they_were_elated and they_decided to_give to_him silver.
\v 6 And he_consented, and was_seeking opportunity which to_give_ him _over to_them without \add a\add*_crowd.
\v 7 And the day the of_non-fermented \add bread\add* came, in_which it_was_fitting the passover_\add feast\add* to_be_being_sacrificed.
\v 8 And he_sent_out Petros and Yōannaʸs having_said: Having_been_gone, prepare the passover_\add feast\add* for_us, in_order_that we_may_eat \add it\add*.
\v 9 And they said to_him: Where are_you_willing we_may_prepare?
\v 10 And he said to_them: Behold, of_you_all having_come_in into the city, \add a\add*_man, bearing \add a\add*_pitcher of_water, will_be_meeting with_you_all, follow after_him into the house into which he_is_entering_in.
\v 11 And you_all_will_be_saying to_the home_owner of_the house: The teacher is_saying to_you: Where is the guest_room, where I_may_eat the passover_\add feast\add* with the apprentices/followers of_me?
\v 12 And_that \add one\add* will_be_showing to_you_all \add an\add*_ large _upper_room, having_been_furnished, prepare there.
\v 13 And having_gone_away, they_found \add it\add* as he_had_said to_them, and they_prepared the passover_\add feast\add*.
\v 14 And when the hour became, he_sat_down and the ambassadors with him.
\v 15 And he_said to them: With_desire I_desired to_eat this the passover_\add feast\add* with you_all, before the \add time\add* for_me to_suffer.
\v 16 For/Because I_am_saying to_you_all that by_no_means I_may_ not _eat it, until of_which it_may_be_fulfilled in the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 17 And having_received \add the\add*_cup, having_given_thanks he_said: Take this, and divide \add it\add* among themselves.
\v 18 For/Because I_am_saying to_you_all, by_no_means I_may_ not _drink of the fruit of_the vine from the \add time\add* now, until of_which the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd* may_come.
\v 19 And having_taken \add the\add*_bread, having_given_thanks, he_broke and gave \add it\add* to_them saying: This is the body of_me, which being_given for you_all, be_doing this in the my remembrance.
\v 20 Also the cup likewise after which to_dine saying: This the cup \add is\add* the new covenant in the blood of_me, which being_poured_out for you_all \add is\add*.
\v 21 However see, the hand of_the \add one\add* giving_over me \add is\add* with me on the table.
\v 22 Because on_one_hand the son of_ the _man is_going according_to the \add place\add* having_been_designated, on_the_other_hand woe to_ the that _man by whom he_is_being_given_over.
\v 23 And they began to_be_debating to themselves, which who consequently it_might_be of them, who going to_be_doing this.
\v 24 And it_ also _became \add a\add*_contention among them, that which of_them is_supposing to_be \add the\add*_greater.
\v 25 And he said to_them: The kings of_the pagans are_mastering of_them, and the \add ones\add* having_authority over_them: are_being_called benefactors.
\v 26 But you_all not thus, but the greater among you_all, him _let_be_becoming as the younger, and the \add one\add* leading, as the \add one\add* serving.
\v 27 For/Because who \add is\add* greater, the \add one\add* reclining or the \add one\add* serving? Not the \add one\add* reclining? But in \add the\add*_midst of_you_all I am as the \add one\add* serving.
\v 28 And you_all are the \add ones\add* having_continued with me, in the trials of_me.
\v 29 And_I am_covenanting to_you_all as the father of_me covenanted \add a\add*_kingdom to_me,
\v 30 in_order_that you_all_may_be_eating and you_all_may_be_drinking at the table of_me in the kingdom of_me, and you_all_are_sitting on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of_ the _Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*).
\v 31 Simōn, Simōn, see, the Satan/(Sāţān) requested to_sift you_all which as the wheat, 
\v 32 but I was_besought for you that the faith of_you may_ not _fail, and you once having_turned_back, strengthen the brothers of_you.
\v 33 And he he_said to_him: \nd master\nd*, I_am ready to_be_going with you both to prison and to death.
\v 34 And he said: I_am_telling to_you, Petros, \add the\add*_rooster ˓will˒_ by_no_means _be_crowing today, until three-times you_will_be_renouncing to_have_known me.
\v 35 And he_said to_them: When I_sent_ you_all _out without purse, and knapsack, and sandals, not you_all_lacked of_anything? And they said: Of_nothing.
\v 36 and He_said to_them: But now the \add one\add* having \add a\add*_purse let_him_take_up \add it\add*, likewise also \add a\add*_knapsack, and the \add one\add* not having, \add a\add*_sword let_him_sell the coat of_him, and let_him_buy.
\v 37 For/Because I_am_saying to_you_all that this which having_been_written, it_is_fitting to_be_accomplished in me, which And he_was_counted with \add the\add*_lawless, because/for also the \add thing\add* concerning me is_having \add an\add*_end.
\v 38 And they said: \nd master\nd*, see, two swords here \add are\add*. And he said to_them, it_is Much.
\v 39 And having_come_out, he_was_gone according_to the custom to the Mount of_ the _Olives, and the apprentices/followers also followed after_him.
\v 40 And having_become to the place, he_said to_them: Be_praying to_ not _come_in into temptation.
\v 41 And he was_withdrawn from them about \add a\add*_stone throw, and having_knelt the knees, he_was_praying
\v 42 saying: father, if you_are_wishing, take_away this the cup from me, however not the will of_me, but the let_ your \add will\add* _be_becoming.
\v 43
\v 44
\v 45 And having_risen_up from the prayer, having_come to the apprentices/followers, he_found them being_fallen_asleep from the sorrow,
\v 46 and he_said to_them: Why are_you_all_sleeping? Having_risen_up be_praying that you_all_may_ not _come_in into temptation.
\v 47 Still of_him speaking, see, \add a\add*_crowd and the \add one\add* being_called Youdas/(Yəhūdāh), one of_the twelve, was_going_ahead them, and he_neared the to_\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* to_kiss him.
\v 48 But \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to_him: Youdas, are_you_giving_over the son of_ the _man with_\add a\add*_kiss?
\v 49 And the \add ones\add* around him having_seen what going_to \add be\add*, they_said: \nd master\nd*, if ˓will˒_we_be_striking with \add the\add*_sword?
\v 50 And \add a\add*_certain one of them he_struck the slave of_the chief_priest, and he_cut_off the the right ear of_him.
\v 51 But the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* answering said: Be_allowing as_far_as this. And having_touched against_the ear, he_healed him.
\v 52 And \nd Yaʸsous\nd* said to the \add ones\add* having_come against him, chief_priests, and officers of_the temple, and elders, you_all_came_out with swords and clubs As against \add a\add*_robber?
\v 53 In_every day of_me being with you_all in the temple, you_all_ not _stretched_out your hands against me. But this is the hour of_you_all, and the power of_the darkness.
\v 54 And having_captured him, they_led \add him\add* and brought_in \add him\add* into the house of_the chief_priest. But the Petros was_following afar.
\v 55 And having_kindled \add a\add*_fire in \add the\add*_midst of_the courtyard, and having_sat_together, the Petros was_sitting in_\add the\add*_midst of_them.
\v 56 And having_seen him, \add a\add*_ certain _servant_girl sitting near the light, and having_looked_intently at_him said: This \add one\add* was also with him.
\v 57 But he disowned \add him\add* saying: I_have_ not _known him, woman.
\v 58 And after \add a\add*_little, another having_seen him was_saying: You are also of them. But the Petros was_saying: Man, I_am not.
\v 59 And one hour having_passed_by about, \add a\add*_certain other was_insisting saying: In truth also this \add one\add* was with him, because/for he_is also \add a\add*_Galilaios.
\v 60 But the Petros said: Man, I_have_ not _known what you_are_saying. And immediately of_him still speaking, \add the\add*_rooster crowed.
\v 61 And the \nd master\nd* having_been_turned, focused_in the on_Petros, and the Petros was_reminded of_the message of_the \nd master\nd*, how he_said to_him, that Before \add the\add*_rooster to_crow today, you_will_be_renouncing me three-times.
\v 62 And having_come_out outside, he_wept bitterly.
\v 63 And the men which holding him, were_mocking at_him beating.
\v 64 And having_blindfolded him, they_were_asking saying: Prophesy, who is the \add one\add* having_struck you?
\v 65 And they_were_saying many other \add things\add* slandering, to him.
\v 66 And when it_became day, the council_of_elders of_the people, both chief_priests and scribes was_gathered_together, and they_led_away him into the council of_them
\v 67 saying: If you are the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, tell to_us. But he_said to_them: If I_may_tell to_you_all, by_no_means you_all_may_ not _believe, 
\v 68 and if I_may_ask, by_no_means you_all_may_ not _answer.
\v 69 And from the \add time\add* now the son of_ the _man will_be sitting on \add the\add*_right of_the power of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 70 and said all: Therefore are you the son of_ the _\nd god\nd*? And he was_saying to them: You_all are_saying that I am.
\v 71 And they said: What are_we_having need of_testimony anymore? For/Because ourselves we_heard \add it\add* from the mouth of_him.
\c 23
\v 1 And all the multitude of_them having_risen_up, they_led him to the Pilatos.
\v 2 And they_began to_be_accusing against_him saying: We_found this \add man\add* perverting the nation of_us, and forbidding to_be_giving taxes to_Kaisar, and saying himself \add the\add*_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, \add a\add*_king to_be.
\v 3 And the Pilatos asked him saying: Are you the king of_the Youdaiōns? And he answering to_him he_was_saying: You are_saying \add it\add*.
\v 4 And the Pilatos said to the chief_priests and the crowds: I_am_finding not_one guilty in the this man.
\v 5 But they were_insisting saying, that He_is_stirring_up the people, teaching throughout all the Youdaia, having_begun from the Galilaia/(Gālīl) as_far_as here.
\v 6 And Pilatos having_heard, he_asked whether the man is \add a\add*_Galilaios.
\v 7 And having_known that he_is from the domain of_Haʸrōdaʸs, he_sent_ him _up to the Haʸrōdaʸs, himself being also at Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim) in these the days.
\v 8 And the Haʸrōdaʸs having_seen the \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, was_elated exceedingly, because/for he_was of much times wanting to_see him, because_of the \add thing\add* to_be_hearing concerning him, and he_was_hoping to_see \add a\add*_certain sign becoming by him.
\v 9 And he_was_asking him in many messages, but he he_answered nothing to_him.
\v 10 And the chief_priests and the scribes had_stood vigorously accusing against_him.
\v 11 And the Haʸrōdaʸs with the armies of_him having_ also _scorned him, and having_mocked \add him\add* having_thrown_ splendid clothing _around \add him\add*, he_sent_up him to_ the _Pilatos.
\v 12 And on same the day the both Haʸrōdaʸs and the Pilatos became friends with one_another, because/for they_were_previously_starting being at enmity with themselves.
\v 13 And Pilatos having_called_together the chief_priests, and the rulers, and the people,
\v 14 said to them: You_all_brought this the man to_me, as turning_away the people, but see, I having_examined \add him\add* before you_all, I_found nothing in the this man guilty of_which you_all_are_accusing against him.
\v 15 But not_even Haʸrōdaʸs \add did\add*, because/for he_sent_ him _up. to us. And see, nothing worthy of_death is having_been_done by_him.
\v 16 Therefore having_disciplined him, I_will_be_sending_away \add him\add*.
\v 17
\v 18 But they_cried_out all_together saying: Be_taking_away this \add man\add*, and send_ The Barabbas _away to_us. 
\v 19 Who was, having_been_throw in the prison because_of \add a\add*_certain insurrection having_become in the city and murder.
\v 20 And again the Pilatos called_out to_them, wanting to_send_ The \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* _away.
\v 21 But they were_crying_out saying: Be_executing_on_a_stake, be_executing_on_a_stake him.
\v 22 And thirdly he said to them: For/Because what evil did this \add man\add*? I_found not_one cause of_death in him. Therefore having_disciplined him, I_will_be_sending_away \add him\add*.
\v 23 And they were_imposing with_ loud _voices, requesting him to_be_executed_on_a_stake, and the voices of_them. were_prevailing.
\v 24 And Pilatos sentenced the request of_them to_become.
\v 25 And sent_away the \add one\add* having_been_throw into the because_of insurrection and murder prison, whom they_were_requesting, but the he_gave_ \nd Yaʸsous\nd* _over to_the will of_them.
\v 26 And as they_led_away him, having_taken_hold_of Simōn, \add a\add*_certain from_Kuraʸnaʸ coming from \add the\add*_country, they_put_ the stake _on to_him, to_be_carrying behind the \nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 27 And \add a\add*_great multitude of_the people was_following with_him, and of_women who were_mourning and were_lamenting him.
\v 28 But \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_been_turned to them, said: Daughters of_Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), be_ not _weeping for me, however be_weeping for yourselves, and for the children of_you_all.
\v 29 Because see, days are_coming in which they_will_be_saying: Blessed \add are\add* the barren, and wombs that not bore, and breasts that not nursed.
\v 30 Then they_will_be_beginning to_be_saying to_the mountains: Fall on us, and to_the hills: Cover us.
\v 31 Because if they_are_doing these \add things\add* in the green tree, what may_become in the dry?
\v 32 And two other criminals were_ also _being_led with him to_be_killed.
\v 33 And when they_came to the place which being_called \add the\add*_skull, there they_executed_on_a_stake him and the criminals, one on_one_hand on \add the\add*_right, one on_the_other_hand on \add the\add*_left.
\v 34 But dividing the clothes of_him, they_throw \add a\add*_lot.
\v 35 And the people observing had_stood. and the rulers they_were_sneering_at \add him\add* also saying, he_saved others, let_him_save himself, if this is the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, the son of_ the _\nd god\nd*, the chosen \add one\add*.
\v 36 And the soldiers they_mocked at_him also approaching, offering wine_vinegar to_him,
\v 37 and saying: If you are the king of_the Youdaiōns, save yourself. 
\v 38 And was also \add an\add*_inscription over him: The king of_the Youdaiōns this \add is\add*.
\v 39 And one of_the criminals having_been_hanged was_slandering him saying: Are you not the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*? Save yourself and us. 
\v 40 But the other \add one\add* answering giving_rebuke to_him was_saying: Not_even are_ you _fearing the \nd god\nd*, that you_are in the same judgment?
\v 41 And we on_one_hand justly, because/for we_are_taking_back worthy \add things\add* of_what we_did, on_the_other_hand this \add one\add* did not_one amiss.
\v 42 And he_was_saying: \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, Be_reminded of_me, whenever you_may_come in the kingdom of_you. 
\v 43 And he_said to_him: Truly, I_am_saying to_you, today you_will_be with me in the paradise.
\v 44 And it_was now about \add the\add*_ sixth _hour, and darkness became over all the land until \add the\add*_ ninth _hour.
\v 45 Of_the sun having_darkened, and the curtain of_the temple was_torn in_\add the\add*_middle.
\v 46 And the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* having_called with_\add a\add*_ loud _voice, said: father: I_am_entrusting the \nd spirit\nd* of_me into \add the\add*_hands of_you. And having_said this, he_expired.
\v 47 And the centurion having_seen the \add thing\add* having_become, he_glorified the \nd god\nd* saying: Really the this man was righteous.
\v 48 And all the crowds having_come_together, to the spectacle this, having_observed the \add things\add* having_become, were_returning striking the chests.
\v 49 And all the acquaintances to_him had_stood from afar, and \add the\add*_women who accompanying with_him from the Galilaia/(Gālīl), seeing these \add things\add*.
\v 50 And see, \add a\add*_man by_\add the\add*_name Yōsaʸf/(Yōşēf), being \add a\add*_council_member, and \add a\add*_ good _man and righteous
\v 51 (this \add one\add* was not having_consented_with with_the counsel and the practice of_them), from Arimathaia, \add a\add*_city of_the Youdaiōns, who was_waiting_for the kingdom of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 52 He having_approached to_ the _Pilatos, requested the body of_ the _\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 53 And having_taken_down \add it\add*, he_wrapped it in_\add a\add*_linen_cloth and put him in \add a\add*_ rock_cut _tomb, where not_yet no_one was not lying.
\v 54 And it_was \add the\add*_day of_preparation, and \add the\add*_day_of_rest was_dawning.
\v 55 And the women having_followed, who were having_come_together from the Galilaia with_him, saw the tomb and how the body of_him was_laid.
\v 56 And having_returned, they_prepared spices and ointments. And indeed on_the day_of_rest they_rested according_to the command.
\c 24
\v 1 But on_the first \add day\add* of_the week, early dawn, they_came to the tomb, bringing spices which they_prepared.
\v 2 And they_found the stone having_been_rolled_away from the tomb.
\v 3 But having_come_in, they_ not _found the body of_the \nd master Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 4 And it_became at the \add time\add* them to_be_perplexing about this, and see, two men approached to_them in flashing clothing.
\v 5 And them having_become frightened, and bowing their faces to the ground, they_said to them: Why are_you_all_seeking the_ living _\add one\add* with the dead?
\v 6 He_is not here, but he_was_raised. Be_reminded how he_spoke to_you_all, still being in the Galilaia/(Gālīl)
\v 7 saying: The son of_ the _man that it_is_fitting to_be_given_over into hands of_ sinful _people, and to_be_executed_on_a_stake, and on_the third day to_rise_up.
\v 8 And they_were_reminded of_the messages of_him.
\v 9 And having_returned from the tomb, they_reported all these \add things\add* to_the eleven, and to_all the rest.
\v 10 And they_were the from_Magdala Maria/(Miryām), and Yōanna, and Maria the \add mother\add* of_Yakōbos/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ), and the rest with them, who_were_telling these \add things\add* to the ambassadors.
\v 11 And the these messages were_seen before them as_if nonsense, and they_were_disbelieving to_them.
\v 12 But the Petros having_risen_up, ran to the tomb, and having_stooped_down, is_seeing only the linen_cloths, and he_went_away to himself, wondering at_the \add thing\add* having_become.
\v 13 And see, two of them at same the day were going to \add a\add*_village being_ sixty stadiums _away from Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), to_whose name \add is\add* Emmaous.
\v 14 And they were_conversing with one_another about all these \add things\add* which having_happened.
\v 15 And it_became at the \add time\add*, them to_be_conversing and to_be_debating, and \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* himself having_neared, was_going_with with_them.
\v 16 But the eyes of_them were_being_restrained which to_ not _know him.
\v 17 And he_said to them: What_all \add are\add* the these messages that you_all_are_exchanging with one_another walking? And they_were_stood \add still\add* downthrow.
\v 18 And \add the\add*_one by_\add the\add*_name Kleopas answering said to him, are_ you only _sojourning to_Hierousalaʸm and you_ not _knew the \add things\add* having_become in it in the these days?
\v 19 And he_said to_them: What \add things\add*? And they said to_him: The \add things\add* concerning \nd Yaʸsous\nd* the Nazaraʸnos, who became \add a\add*_man, \add a\add*_prophet, powerful in work and message, before the \nd god\nd* and all the people,
\v 20 and so_that the chief_priests and the rulers of_us gave_ him _over, to judgment of_death, and they_executed_on_a_stake him.
\v 21 But we were_hoping that he is the \add one\add* going to_be_redeeming the Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*). But surely also with all these \add things\add*, it_is_coming this third day, from which these \add things\add* became.
\v 22 But also some women from us, amazed us, having_become early to the tomb
\v 23 and not having_found the body of_him, came saying also to_have_seen \add a\add*_vision of_messengers, who are_saying him to_be_living.
\v 24 And some of_the \add ones\add* with us went_away to the tomb, and they_found \add it\add* thus, as the women said, but they_ not _saw him.
\v 25 And he said to them: Oh foolish and slow the in_heart, which to_be_believing in all \add things\add* that the prophets spoke.
\v 26 Not was_it_fitting the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* to_suffer these \add things\add* and to_come_in into the glory of_him?
\v 27 And having_begun from Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh) and from all the prophets, he_interpreted all the scriptures to_them in the \add things\add* concerning himself.
\v 28 And they_neared to the village where they_were_going, and he seemed to_be_going farther_away.
\v 29 And they_urged him saying: Remain with us, because it_is toward evening, and the day has_ now _declined. And he_came_in which to_remain with them.
\v 30 And it_became at the \add time\add* him to_be_reclining with them, having_taken the bread, he_blessed \add it\add* and having_broke \add it\add*, was_handing_out \add it\add* to_them.
\v 31 And the eyes them were_opened_up, and they_recognized him. And he became vanished from them.
\v 32 And they_said to one_another: Not the heart of_us being_burned was as he_was_speaking with_us on the road, as he_was_opening_up the scriptures to_us?
\v 33 And having_risen_up to_\add the\add*_same the hour, they_returned to Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim), and they_found the eleven and the \add ones\add* with them having_been_gathered
\v 34 saying, that The \nd master\nd* really was_raised, and was_seen to_Simōn.
\v 35 And they were_explaining the \add things\add* on the road, and how he_was_known to_them in the breaking of_the bread.
\v 36 And of_them speaking these \add things\add*, himself stood in midst of_them and is_saying to_them: Peace to_you_all.
\v 37 but having_been_terrified and having_become frightened, they_were_supposing to_be_observing \add a\add*_spirit.
\v 38 And he_said to_them: Why are_you_all having_been_disturbed, and for_reason why are_ speculations _going_up in the heart of_you_all?
\v 39 See the hands of_me and the feet of_me that I am he. Touch me and see, because \add a\add*_spirit is_ not _having flesh and bones, as you_all_are_observing me having.
\v 40 And having_said this, he_showed his hands and his feet to_them.
\v 41 And still of_them disbelieving for the joy and wondering, he_said to_them: You_all_are_having any edible \add thing\add* here?
\v 42 And they handed_out to_him part of_\add a\add*_ broiled _fish.
\v 43 And having_taken \add it\add*, he_ate before of_them.
\v 44 And he_said to them: These \add are\add* the messages of_me, which I_spoke to you_all still being with you_all, that it_is_fitting to_be_fulfilled all the \add things\add* having_been_written in the law of_Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh), and the prophets, and psalms, concerning me.
\v 45 Then he_opened_up the mind of_them which to_be_understanding the scriptures. And he_said to_them,
\v 46 that Thus it_has_been_written, the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* to_suffer, and to_rise_up from \add the\add*_dead on_the third day,
\v 47 and the name of_him to_be_proclaimed in repentance for forgiveness of_sins to all the nations, having_begun from Hierousalaʸm/(Yərūshālayim).
\v 48 You_all \add are\add* witnesses of_these \add things\add*.
\v 49 And see I am_sending_out the promise of_the father of_me on you_all, but you_all sit_down in the city, until of_which you_all_may_dress_in power from of_height.
\v 50 And he_led_ them _out as_far_as to Baʸthania, and having_lifted_up the hands of_him, he_blessed them.
\v 51 And it_became at the \add time\add* of_him to_be_blessing to_them, he_passed_by from them, and he_was_being_brought_up into the sky.
\v 52 And they having_prostrated before_him, returned to Hierousalaʸm with great joy.
\v 53 And they_were in the temple blessing the \nd god\nd* through everything.
