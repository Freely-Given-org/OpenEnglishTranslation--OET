\v 1 Paulos, and Silouanos, and Timotheos, to_the assembly of_\add the\add*_\add ones\add*_from_Thessalonikaʸ in \nd god\nd* \add the\add*_father and \add the\add*_\nd master Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*: grace to_you_all and peace.
\v 2 We_are_giving_thanks to_ the _\nd god\nd* always concerning all of_you, remembrance making in the prayers of_us, unceasingly
\v 3 remembering of_you_all about_the work of_ the _faith, and the labour of_ the _love, and the endurance of_ the _hope of_the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd*, before the \nd god\nd* and father of_us,
\v 4 having_known, brothers having_been_loved by the \nd god\nd*, the choice of_you_all,
\v 5 because the good_message of_us not was_become to you_all in message only, but also in power, and in \add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd* holy, and full_assurance much, as you_all_have_known such_as we_were_become you_all because_of you_all.
\v 6 And you_all imitators of_us were_become and of_the \nd master\nd*, having_received the message in tribulation much with \add the\add*_joy of_\add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd* holy,
\v 7 so_as to_become you_all examples to_all the \add ones\add* believing in the Makedonia and in the Aⱪaia.
\v 8 From for you_all has_been_sounded_out the message of_the \nd master\nd*, not only in the Makedonia and in the Aⱪaia, but in every place the faith of_you_all which toward the \nd god\nd* has_come_out, so_as no need to_be_having us to_be_speaking anything.
\v 9 For/Because they concerning us are_reporting what_kind entrance we_had to you_all, and how you_all_turned_back to the \nd god\nd* from the idols, to_be_serving for_\add the\add*_\nd god\nd* living and true,
\v 10 and to_be_waiting for_the son of_him from the heavens, whom he_raised from the dead, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, the \add one\add* rescuing us from the severe_anger which coming.

\v 1 For/Because yourselves you_all_have_known, brothers, the entrance of_us which to you_all, that not vain it_has_become,
\v 2 but having_previously_suffered and having_been_mistreated, as you_all_have_known, in Filippou we_spoke_boldly in the \nd god\nd* of_us, to_speak to you_all the good_message of_ the _\nd god\nd* among much struggle.
\v 3 For/Because the exhortation of_us not of deception, nor of impurity, nor in deceit,
\v 4 but as we_have_been_approved by the \nd god\nd*, to_be_entrusted the good_message, thus we_are_speaking, not as to_people bringing_pleasure, but to_\nd god\nd*, the \add one\add* approving the hearts of_us.
\v 5 For/Because neither once with message of_flattery we_were_become, as you_all_have_known, nor with \add a\add*_under_pretense for_greediness (\nd god\nd* \add is\add* witness)
\v 6 nor seeking from people glory, neither from you_all, nor from others,
\v 7 being_able in burden to_be, as of_\nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* ambassadors. But we_were_become infants in \add the\add*_midst of_you_all, as if \add a\add*_nursing_mother may_be_cherishing the of_herself children.
\v 8 Thus longing for_you_all, we_were_taking_pleasure to_share with_you_all, not only the good_message of_ the _\nd god\nd*, but also the of_ourselves lives, because beloved to_us you_all_were_become.
\v 9 For/Because you_all_are_remembering, brothers, the labour of_us and the hardship, night and day working, in_order that not to_burden anyone of_you_all, we_proclaimed to you_all the good_message of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 10 You_all \add are\add* witnesses and the \nd god\nd*, how devoutly, and justly, and blamelessly, to_you_all the \add ones\add* believing we_were_become,
\v 11 just_as you_all_have_known how one each of_you_all, as \add a\add*_father to_children of_himself,
\v 12 exhorting you_all, and consoling, and testifying, in_order that to_be_walking you_all worthily of_ the _\nd god\nd*, the \add one\add* having_called you_all into the of_himself kingdom and glory.
\v 13 And because_of this also we are_giving_thanks to_ the _\nd god\nd* unceasingly that having_received \add the\add*_message by_hearing from us of_ the _\nd god\nd*, you_all_received not \add the\add*_message of_humans, but as truly it_is, \add the\add*_message of_\nd god\nd*, which also is_working in you_all which believing.
\v 14 For/Because you_all imitators were_become, brothers, of_the assemblies of_ the _\nd god\nd*, which being in the Youdaia in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, because the same \add things\add* you_all_suffered, also you_all by your own fellow-countrymen, as also they \add did\add* by the Youdaiōns,
\v 15 who both the \nd master\nd* having_killed_off \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, and their prophets, and us having_driven_out, and to_\nd god\nd* not bringing_pleasure, but to_all people of_contrary,
\v 16 forbidding us to_the pagans to_speak, in_order_that they_may_be_saved, because/for which to_fulfill of_them the sins always. But came on them the severe_anger to end.
\v 17 But we, brothers, having_been_orphaned of you_all, because/for \add the\add*_time of_\add an\add*_hour, in_face not in_heart, more_abundantly we_were_earnest the face of_you_all to_see with great desire.
\v 18 Because we_wanted to_come to you_all, I indeed Paulos, both once and twice, and hindered us the Satan/(Sāţān).
\v 19 For/Because who \add is\add* of_us \add the\add*_hope or \add the\add*_joy or \add the\add*_crown of_boasting? Or not \add are\add* even you_all, before the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, at the of_him coming?
\v 20 For/Because you_all are the glory of_us, and the joy.

\v 1 Therefore no_longer enduring, we_took_pleasure to_be_left in Athaʸnai alone,
\v 2 and we_sent Timotheos, the brother of_us, and servant of_ the _\nd god\nd* in the good_message of_the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, in_order that to_strengthen you_all and to_exhort, concerning the faith of_you_all,
\v 3 that no_one to_be_being_disturbed by the tribulations these. For/Because yourselves you_all_have_known that for this we_are_appointing.
\v 4 For/Because also when with you_all we_were, we_were_previously_saying to_you_all that we_are_going to_be_being_oppressed, as also it_became and you_all_have_known.
\v 5 Because_of this also_I no_longer enduring, I_sent in_order that to_know the faith of_you_all, lest somehow tempted you_all the \add one\add* tempting, and in vain may_become the labour of_us.
\v 6 But now having_come Timotheos to us from you_all, and having_good_message_preached to_us about_the faith and the love of_you_all, and that you_all_are_having \add a\add*_mentioning of_us good always, longing us to_see, just_as also we you_all.
\v 7 Because_of this we_were_comforted, brothers, by you_all in all the hardship and tribulation of_us, through the of_you_all faith.
\v 8 Because now we_are_living, if you_all are_standing_firm in \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*.
\v 9 For/Because what thanksgiving we_are_being_able to_the to_\nd god\nd* to_repay concerning you_all, because/for all the joy that we_are_rejoicing because_of you_all, before the \nd god\nd* of_us.
\v 10 Night and day, beyond_exceedingly beseeching in_order that to_see of_you_all the face, and to_prepare the lacking \add things\add* in_the faith of_you_all?
\v 11 And himself the \nd god\nd* and father of_us, and the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, might_direct the way of_us to you_all.
\v 12 And you_all the \nd master\nd* might_be_plentiful and might_be_plentiful the in_love toward one_another, and toward all, just_as also we toward you_all,
\v 13 in_order that to_strengthen of_you_all the hearts, blameless in holiness before the \nd god\nd* and father of_us, at the coming of_the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous\nd*, with all the holy \add ones\add* of_him. Truly.

\v 1 Therefore finally, brothers, we_are_asking you_all and we_are_exhorting in \add the\add*_\nd master Yaʸsous\nd*, as you_all_received from us, which how it_is_fitting you_all to_be_walking and to_be_bringing_pleasure to_\nd god\nd* (as even you_all_are_walking), in_order_that you_all_may_be_being_plentiful more.
\v 2 For/Because you_all_have_known what_all charges we_gave to_you_all through the \nd master Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 3 For/Because this is \add the\add*_will of_ the _\nd god\nd*, the holiness of_you_all, to_be_keeping_away you_all from the sexual_immorality,
\v 4 to_have_known each of_you_all the of_himself vessel, to_be_acquiring in holiness and honour,
\v 5 not in \add the\add*_passion of_lust, just_as also the pagans which not having_known the \nd god\nd*,
\v 6 which not to_be_going_beyond and to_be_exploiting in the matter the brother of_him, because avenging \add is\add* \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* concerning all these \add things\add*, as also we_previously_said to_you_all and we_testified.
\v 7 For/Because not called us the \nd god\nd* to impurity, but in holiness.
\v 8 So_then the \add one\add* rejecting \add this\add*, not \add a\add*_human is_rejecting, but the \nd god\nd*, the \add one\add* giving the \nd spirit\nd* of_him the holy to you_all.
\v 9 And concerning the brotherly_love, no need you_all_are_having \add for_me\add* to_be_writing to_you_all, because/for yourselves you_all god-taught are, in_order that to_be_loving one_another.
\v 10 For/Because also you_all_are_doing it toward all the brothers, who \add are\add* in all the Makedonia. But we_are_exhorting you_all, brothers, to_be_being_plentiful more,
\v 11 and to_be_being_ambitious to_be_living_quietly and to_be_doing your own \add things\add*, and to_be_working with_your own hands of_you_all, as to_you_all we_commanded,
\v 12 in_order_that you_all_may_be_walking properly toward the \add ones\add* outside, and of_nothing need you_all_may_be_having.
\v 13 Not but we_are_wanting you_all to_be_not_knowing, brothers, concerning the \add ones\add* being_fallen_asleep, in_order_that not you_all _may_be_being_sorrowed, as also the rest, the \add ones\add* not having hope.
\v 14 For/Because if we_are_believing that \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* died_off and rose_up, thus also the \nd god\nd* the \add ones\add* having_been_fallen_asleep through the \nd Yaʸsous\nd* will_be_bringing with him.
\v 15 For/Because this to_you_all we_are_saying in \add the\add*_message of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, that we the \add ones\add* living, which being_remaining to the coming of_the \nd master\nd*, by_no_means not may_precede the \add ones\add* having_been_fallen_asleep.
\v 16 Because himself the \nd master\nd* with \add a\add*_loud_command, with \add the\add*_voice of_\add an\add*_archangel, and with \add the\add*_trumpet of_\nd god\nd*, will_be_coming_down from heaven, and the dead in \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* will_be_rising_up first,
\v 17 then we the \add ones\add* living, which being_remaining together with them, will_be_being_snatched in \add the\add*_clouds for \add the\add*_meeting of_the \nd master\nd* in \add the\add*_air, and thus always with \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* we_will_be.
\v 18 So_then be_comforting one_another with the messages these.

\v 1 And concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, no need you_all_are_having to_you_all to_be_being_written.
\v 2 For/Because yourselves exactly you_all_have_known that \add the\add*_day of_\add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, as \add a\add*_thief by night thus is_coming.
\v 3 Whenever they_may_be_saying: Peace and security, then sudden is_recognizing to_them destruction, as the birth_pains to_the \add woman\add* in pregnant having \add a_child\add*, and by_no_means not they_may_escape.
\v 4 But you_all, brothers, not are in darkness, in_order_that the day you_all like thieves may_grasp.
\v 5 For/Because all you_all sons of_light are, and sons of_day. Neither we_are of_night nor of_darkness.
\v 6 Therefore consequently not we_may_be_sleeping as the rest, but we_may_be_watching and we_may_be_being_sober.
\v 7 For/Because the \add ones\add* sleeping, by_night are_sleeping, and the \add ones\add* being_drunk, by_night are_being_drunk.
\v 8 But we of_\add the\add*_day being, may_be_being_sober, having_dressed_in \add the\add*_breastplate of_faith and love, and \add the\add*_helmet, \add the\add*_hope of_salvation.
\v 9 Because not appointed the \nd god\nd* us for severe_anger, but for procuring of_salvation through the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*,
\v 10 the \add one\add* having_died_off for us, in_order_that whether we_may_be_watching or we_may_be_sleeping, together with him we_may_live.
\v 11 Therefore be_comforting one_another, and be_building one the one, as also you_all_are_doing.
\v 12 But we_are_asking you_all, brothers, to_have_known the \add ones\add* labouring among you_all, and leading of_you_all in \add the\add*_\nd master\nd*, and admonishing you_all,
\v 13 and to_be_considering them beyond_exceedingly in love, because_of the work of_them. Be_being_at_peace among yourselves.
\v 14 And we_are_exhorting you_all, brothers, be_admonishing the lazy, be_consoling the fainthearted, be_upholding of_the weak, be_being_patient toward all.
\v 15 Be_seeing not someone evil for evil to_anyone may_give_back, but always the good be_pursuing, and toward one_another and toward all.
\v 16 Always be_rejoicing.
\v 17 Unceasingly be_praying.
\v 18 In everything be_giving_thanks, because/for this \add is\add* \add the\add*_will of_\nd god\nd* in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous\nd* toward you_all.
\v 19 The \nd spirit\nd* not be_extinguishing.
\v 20 Prophesies not be_scorning.
\v 21 All \add things\add* be_approving, the good be_keeping.
\v 22 From every appearance of_evil be_keeping_away.
\v 23 And himself the \nd god\nd* of_ the _peace might_sanctify you_all complete, and complete of_you_all the spirit, and the soul, and the body, blamelessly at the coming of_the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*, might_have_kept.
\v 24 Faithful \add is\add* the \add one\add* calling you_all, who also will_be_performing \add it\add*.
\v 25 Brothers, be_praying also for us.
\v 26 Greet the brothers all with \add a\add*_kiss holy.
\v 27 I_am_adjuring you_all by_the \nd master\nd*, to_be_read my letter to_all the brothers.
\v 28 The grace of_the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd*, with you_all \add be\add*. Truly.
