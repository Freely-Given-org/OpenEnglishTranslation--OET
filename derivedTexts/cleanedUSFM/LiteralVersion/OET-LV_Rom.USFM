\v 1 Paulos, slave of_\nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, \add a\add*_called ambassador, having_been_set_apart for \add the\add*_good_message of_\nd god\nd*,
\v 2 which he_previously_promised through the prophets of_him in \add the\add*_scriptures holy,
\v 3 concerning the son of_him, which having_become of seed of_Dawid/(Dāvid) according_to \add the\add*_flesh,
\v 4 which having_been_designated \add the\add*_son of_\nd god\nd* in power according_to \nd spirit\nd* of_holiness by \add the\add*_resurrection of_\add the\add*_dead, \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd* the \nd master\nd* of_us,
\v 5 through whom we_received grace and commission to obedience of_faith among all the pagans for the name of_him,
\v 6 among whom are also you_all called \add ones\add* of_\nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd*,
\v 7 to_all the \add ones\add* being in Ɽōmaʸ, beloved of_\nd god\nd*, called holy \add ones\add*: grace to_you_all and peace from \nd god\nd* \add the\add*_father of_us and \add the\add*_\nd master Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 8 First indeed I_am_giving_thanks to_the \nd god\nd* of_me through \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd* for all of_you, because the faith of_you_all is_being_proclaimed in all the world.
\v 9 For/Because witness of_me is the \nd god\nd*, unto_whom I_am_serving in the spirit of_me in the good_message of_the son of_him, how unceasingly mentioning of_you_all I_am_making
\v 10 always on the prayers of_me, beseeching if somehow now once I_will_be_being_prospered by the will of_ the _\nd god\nd*, to_come to you_all.
\v 11 For/Because I_am_longing to_see you_all, in_order_that \add a\add*_certain I_may_share gift with_you_all spiritual, in_order that to_be_strengthened you_all,
\v 12 and this is, to_be_encouraged_together among to_you_all, through the among one_another faith, of_you_all both and of_me.
\v 13 Not and I_am_wanting you_all to_be_not_knowing, brothers, that often I_purposed to_come to you_all, and I_was_forbidden until the \add time\add* presently, in_order_that some fruit I_may_have also among you_all, as even among the other pagans.
\v 14 To_Hellaʸns both and to_foreigners, to_\add the\add*_wise both and \add the\add*_foolish, \add a\add*_debtor I_am.
\v 15 Thus which concerning me, eager \add am_I\add* also to_you_all who \add are\add* in Ɽōmaʸ to_good_message_preach.
\v 16 For/Because not I_am_being_ashamed of_the good_message, because/for \add the\add*_power of_\nd god\nd* it_is to salvation to_everyone the \add one\add* believing, to_Youdaios both first and to_Hellaʸn.
\v 17 For/Because \add the\add*_righteousness of_\nd god\nd* in it is_being_revealed, by faith to faith, as it_has_been_written: And the righteous by faith will_be_living.
\v 18 For/Because is_being_revealed \add the\add*_severe_anger of_\nd god\nd* from heaven, on all ungodliness and unrighteousness of_people, which the truth by unrighteousness restraining,
\v 19 because the known \add thing\add* of_ the _\nd god\nd*, manifest is among them, the For/Because \nd god\nd* to_them revealed \add it\add*.
\v 20 For/Because the invisible \add things\add* of_him from \add the\add*_creation of_\add the\add*_world, by_the workmanship being_understood, is_being_clearly_seen, the both eternal of_him power and divinity, in_order that to_be them inexcusable.
\v 21 Because having_known the \nd god\nd*, not as \nd god\nd* they_glorified or they_gave_thanks, but they_were_made_useless in the speculations of_them, and was_darkened the unintelligent of_them heart.
\v 22 Alleging to_be wise, they_were_made_foolish,
\v 23 and they_changed the glory of_the indestructible \nd god\nd* into \add a\add*_likeness of_\add an\add*_image of_\add a\add*_mortal human, and birds, and quadrupeds, and reptiles.
\v 24 Therefore gave_over them the \nd god\nd* in the desires of_the hearts of_them to impurity, which to_be_dishonouring the bodies of_them in themselves,
\v 25 who exchanged the truth of_ the _\nd god\nd* into the falsehood, and were_worshipped and serving unto_the creation contrary_to the \add one\add* having_created \add it\add*, who is blessed to the ages. Truly. 
\v 26 Because_of this, gave_over them the \nd god\nd* to passions of_dishonour, which for both female of_them exchanged the natural usage into the contrary_to nature,
\v 27 and likewise also the male having_left the natural usage of_the female, were_burned in the desire of_them toward one_another, male with male the shame producing, and the recompense which it_was_fitting of_the deception of_them, in themselves taking_back.
\v 28 And as not they_approved the \nd god\nd* to_be_having in knowledge, gave_over them the \nd god\nd* to \add an\add*_unqualified mind, to_be_doing the \add things\add* not befitting,
\v 29 having_been_filled with_all unrighteousness, wickedness, greediness, malice, full of_envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness, gossips,
\v 30 slanderers, god-hating, abusers, proud, braggers, inventors of_evil, to_parents unpersuadable,
\v 31 unintelligent, untrustworthy, unloving, unmerciful, 
\v 32 who the just_act of_ the _\nd god\nd* having_known that the \add ones\add* the such \add things\add* doing worthy of_death are, not only them are_practicing, but also they_are_consenting to_the \add ones\add* practicing.
\c 2
\nb
\v 1 Therefore inexcusable you_are, Oh person, everyone who \add is\add* judging, in for that you_are_judging the other, yourself you_are_condemning, because/for the same \add things\add* you_are_doing, the \add one\add* judging.
\v 2 But we_have_known that the judgement of_ the _\nd god\nd* is according_to truth on the \add ones\add* the such \add things\add* practicing.
\v 3 But you_are_counting this, Oh person, you judging the \add ones\add* the such \add things\add* practicing, and doing them \add yourself\add*, that you will_be_escaping the judgement of_ the _\nd god\nd*?
\v 4 Or of_the riches of_the kindness of_him, and of_the forbearance, and of_the patience you_are_despising, not_knowing that the kindness of_ the _\nd god\nd*, to repentance you is_leading?
\v 5 But concerning the hardness of_you and unrepentant heart, you_are_storing_up for_yourself severe_anger in \add the\add*_day of_severe_anger and revelation \add the\add*_just_judgement of_ the _\nd god\nd*,
\v 6 who will_be_giving_back to_each \add one\add* according_to the works of_him:
\v 7 to_the \add ones\add* on_one_hand with endurance in_work good, glory and honour and indestructibility seeking, life eternal, 
\v 8 on_the_other_hand to_the \add ones\add* of selfish_ambition and disbelieving in_the truth, but being_persuaded the by_unrighteousness, severe_anger and rage \add be\add*.
\v 9 Tribulation and distress, on every soul of_human_origin which producing the evil, of_Youdaios both first and of_Hellaʸn, 
\v 10 but glory, and honour, and peace, to_everyone which doing the good, to_Youdaios both first and to_Hellaʸn.
\v 11 For/Because not is favouritism with the \nd god\nd*.
\v 12 For/Because as_many_as unlawfully sinned, unlawfully also will_be_perishing, and as_many_as in law sinned, by law will_be_being_judged, 
\v 13 for/because not the listeners of_\add the\add*_law \add are\add* righteous with the \nd god\nd*, but the doers of_\add the\add*_law will_be_being_justified.
\v 14 For/Because whenever \add the\add*_pagans which not \add the\add*_law having, by_nature the \add things\add* of_the law may_be_practicing, these \add the\add*_law not having, to_themselves are \add a\add*_law, 
\v 15 who are_displaying the work of_the law, written in the hearts of_them, bearing_witness_with them their conscience, and between one_another, the arguments accusing or also defending \add them\add*,
\v 16 on that \add the\add*_day is_judging the \nd god\nd* the secrets of_ the _people, according_to the good_message of_me, by \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 17 But, if you \add a\add*_Youdaios is_being_named, and are_resting_on on_\add the\add*_law, and are_boasting in \nd god\nd*,
\v 18 and are_knowing his will, and are_approving the \add things\add* carrying_value, being_instructed out_of the law,
\v 19 and you_have_persuaded yourself \add a\add*_guide to_be of_\add the\add*_blind, \add a\add*_light to_the \add ones\add* in darkness,
\v 20 \add an\add*_instructor of_\add the\add*_foolish, \add a\add*_teacher of_infants, having the appearance of_ the _knowledge and of_the truth in the law, 
\v 21 therefore you teaching another, yourself not are_teaching? You proclaiming not to_be_stealing, you_are_stealing?
\v 22 You saying not to_be_committing_adultery, you_are_committing_adultery? You detesting the idols, you_are_temple-robbing?
\v 23 Who in law are_boasting through the transgression of_the law, the \nd god\nd* you_are_dishonouring?
\v 24 For/Because the name of_ the _\nd god\nd* because_of you_all is_being_slandered among the pagans, as it_has_been_written.
\v 25 Circumcision for on_one_hand is_benefiting, if \add the\add*_law you_may_be_practicing, on_the_other_hand if \add a\add*_transgressor of_law you_may_be_may_be, the circumcision of_you, uncircumcision has_become.
\v 26 Therefore if the uncircumcision, the just_acts of_the law may_be_keeping, not the uncircumcision of_him for circumcision will_be_being_counted?
\v 27 And will_be_judging the by nature uncircumcision, the law finishing, you who through \add the\add*_letter and circumcision \add are\add* \add a\add*_transgressor of_law.
\v 28 For/Because not the \add one\add* on the outward \add a\add*_Youdaios is, nor the in the outward in flesh circumcision, 
\v 29 but the \add one\add* on the secret \add a\add*_Youdaios \add is\add*, and circumcision \add is\add* of_heart, by \add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd*, not by_\add the\add*_letter, of_whom the praise not of humans, but of the \nd god\nd*.
\c 3
\nb
\v 1 Therefore \add is\add* what the additional \add thing\add* of_the Youdaios, or what \add is\add* the benefit of_ the _circumcision?
\v 2 Much in every manner. First for indeed that they_were_entrusted the oracles of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 3 For/Because what if disbelieved some? Not the unbelief of_them, the faith of_ the _\nd god\nd* will_be_nullifying?
\v 4 Never it_might_become. And let_be_becoming the \nd god\nd* true, and every person \add a\add*_liar, just_as it_has_been_written: So_that wishfully you_may_be_justified in the messages of_you, and you_will_be_overcoming in the \add time\add* to_be_being_judged you.
\v 5 But if the unrighteousness of_us, of_\nd god\nd* \add the\add*_righteousness is_demonstrating, what we_will_be_saying? Not unrighteous \add is\add* the \nd god\nd*, the \add one\add* inflicting the severe_anger? (According_to human_origin I_am_speaking.)
\v 6 Never it_might_become. Otherwise how will_be_judging the \nd god\nd* the world?
\v 7 If but the truth of_ the _\nd god\nd* in the my falsehood been_plentiful to the glory of_him, why still also_I as \add a\add*_sinner am_being_judged?
\v 8 And not as we_are_being_slandered, and as are_saying some us to_be_saying, that We_may_practice the evil, in_order_that may_come the good? Of_whom their judgement just is.
\v 9 Therefore what? We_are_having_advantage? Not certainly, because/for we_previously_charged, Youdaiōns both and Hellaʸns, all under sin to_be.
\v 10 As it_has_been_written, that Not \add one\add* there_is righteous, not_even one,
\v 11 not there_is understanding, not there_is the \add one\add* seeking_out the \nd god\nd*.
\v 12 All turned_away, together they_were_being_useless, not \add one\add* there_is practicing kindness, not there_is as_much_as one.
\v 13 \add A\add*_tomb having_been_opened_up the throat \add is\add* of_them, with_the tongues of_them they_were_deceiving: Poison of_asps \add is\add* under the lips of_them,
\v 14 Of_whom their mouth of_cursing and bitterness is_being_full, 
\v 15 Sharp \add are\add* the feet of_them, to_pour_out blood…
\v 16 destruction and misery in the ways of_them,
\v 17 and \add the\add*_way of_peace not they_knew.
\v 18 Not is reverence of_\nd god\nd* in_front_of the eyes of_them.
\v 19 And we_have_known that as_much_as the law is_saying, to_the \add ones\add* in the law it_is_speaking, in_order_that every mouth may_be_shut, and under_judgement may_become all the world to_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 20 Because by works of_law, not will_be_being_justified any flesh before him, because/for through \add the\add*_law \add is\add* \add the\add*_knowledge of_sin.
\v 21 But now apart_from law, \add the\add*_righteousness of_\nd god\nd* has_been_revealed, being_attested by the law and the prophets,
\v 22 and \add the\add*_righteousness of_\nd god\nd* through faith of_\nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*, toward all the \add ones\add* believing, because/for no there_is distinction.
\v 23 For/Because all sinned and are_being_fallen_short of_the glory of_ the _\nd god\nd*,
\v 24 being_justified undeservedly by_the of_him grace, through the redemption which in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous\nd*, 
\v 25 whom set_forth the \nd god\nd* as_\add an\add*_atonement, through the faith in the of_him blood, for \add a\add*_sign of_the righteousness of_him, because_of the forbearance of_the having_previously_happened sins
\v 26 in the forbearance of_ the _\nd god\nd*, for the sign of_the righteousness of_him in the present time, in_order that to_be him righteous and justifying the \add one\add* of faith in_\nd Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 27 Therefore \add is\add* where the boasting? It_was_excluded. Through what law? Of_ The _works? No, but through \add a\add*_law of_faith.
\v 28 Therefore we_are_counting to_be_being_justified by_faith \add a\add*_person, apart_from works of_law.
\v 29 Or of_Youdaiōns \add is_he\add* the \nd god\nd* only? Not also of_pagans? Yes, also of_pagans,
\v 30 if_indeed one the \nd god\nd* \add is\add*, who will_be_justifying \add the\add*_circumcision by faith, and \add the\add*_uncircumcision through the faith.
\v 31 Therefore law we_are_nullifying through the faith? Never it_might_become. But \add the\add*_law we_are_establishing.
\c 4
\nb
\v 1 Therefore what we_will_be_saying, to_have_found Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām) the forefather of_us according_to \add the\add*_flesh?
\v 2 For/Because if Abraʼam by works was_justified, he_is_having \add a\add*_boast, but not toward \nd god\nd*.
\v 3 For/Because what the scripture is_saying? And believed Abraʼam the in_\nd god\nd*, and it_was_counted to_him for righteousness.
\v 4 And to_the \add one\add* working, the reward not is_being_counted by grace, but by debt.
\v 5 But to_the \add one\add* not working, but believing in the \add one\add* justifying the ungodly, is_being_counted the faith of_him for righteousness,
\v 6 just_as also Dawid/(Dāvid) is_saying the blessing of_the person to_whom the \nd god\nd* is_counting righteousness apart_from works:
\v 7 Blessed \add are_they\add*, of_whom were_forgiven their lawlessness and of_whom were_covered-up their sins.
\v 8 Blessed \add is\add* \add the\add*_man, of_whom by_no_means not may_count \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* sin.
\v 9 The therefore \add is\add* blessing this on the circumcision, or also on the uncircumcision? For/Because we_are_saying: ˓Was˒_counted to_ the _Abraʼam the faith for righteousness.
\v 10 Therefore how it_was_counted? In circumcision being, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision, 
\v 11 and \add the\add*_sign he_received of_circumcision, \add a\add*_seal of_the righteousness of_the faith which in the uncircumcision, in_order that to_be him father of_all the \add ones\add* believing through uncircumcision, in_order that to_be_counted to_them the righteousness,
\v 12 and father of_circumcision to_the \add ones\add* not of circumcision only, but also to_the \add ones\add* aligning in_the steps which in uncircumcision of_faith, of_the father of_us Abraʼam/(ʼAⱱrāhām).
\v 13 For/Because not by law the promise \add was\add* to_ the _Abraʼam or the descendants of_him, that heir him to_be of_\add the\add*_world, but by righteousness in_faith.
\v 14 For/Because if the \add ones\add* of law \add are\add* heirs, has_been_voided the faith and has_been_nullified the promise.
\v 15 For/Because the law severe_anger is_producing, where and no there_is law, neither \add is\add* transgression.
\v 16 Because_of this \add is\add* of faith, in_order_that according_to grace, in_order that to_be confirmed, the promise to_all the seed, not to_the \add seed\add* of the law only, but also to_the \add seed\add* of \add the\add*_faith of_Abraʼam, who is \add the\add*_father of_all of_us,
\v 17 as it_has_been_written, that \add A\add*_father of_many nations I_have_appointed you, in_front_of whom he_believed, \nd god\nd* the \add one\add* giving_life to_the dead, and calling the \add things\add* not being as being.
\v 18 Who contrary_to hope, in hope believed, in_order that to_become him \add the\add*_father of_many nations, according_to the \add message\add* having_been_spoken: Thus will_be the descendants of_you.
\v 19 And not having_faltered in_the faith, he_observed the of_himself body already having_been_made_dead, \add a\add*_hundred_year \add old\add* about being, and the death of_the womb of_Sarra/(Sārāh),
\v 20 but at the promise of_ the _\nd god\nd*, not he_was_doubted the in_unbelief, but he_was_strengthened the in_faith, having_given glory to_ the _\nd god\nd*,
\v 21 and having_been_fully_assured that what he_has_promised, able he_is also to_do.
\v 22 Therefore also it_was_counted to_him for righteousness.
\v 23 Not but it_was_written because_of him only, that it_was_counted to_him,
\v 24 but also because_of us, to_whom it_is_going to_be_being_counted, to_the \add ones\add* believing in the \add one\add* having_raised \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, the \nd master\nd* of_us, from dead,
\v 25 who was_given_over for the transgressions of_us, and was_raised for the justification of_us.
\c 5
\nb
\v 1 Therefore having_been_justified by faith, peace we_may_be_having with the \nd god\nd*, through the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd*,
\v 2 through whom also the access we_have_had, the by_faith into the grace this, in which we_have_stood, and we_are_boasting in hope of_the glory of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 3 Not and only \add that\add*, but also we_are_boasting in our tribulations, having_known that the tribulation endurance is_producing,
\v 4 and the endurance provenness, and the provenness hope.
\v 5 And the hope not is_disgracing, because the love of_ the _\nd god\nd* has_been_poured_out in the hearts of_us through \add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd* holy, the \add one\add* having_been_given to_us.
\v 6 Still for \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, being of_us weak still, according_to \add the\add*_time for \add the\add*_ungodly died_off.
\v 7 For/Because rarely for \add a\add*_righteous \add man\add* anyone will_be_dying_off, because/for for the good, possibly someone even is_daring to_die_off.
\v 8 But is_demonstrating the of_himself love to us the \nd god\nd*, that still sinners being of_us, \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* for us died_off.
\v 9 Therefore by_much more having_been_justified now by the blood of_him, we_will_be_being_saved by him from the severe_anger.
\v 10 For/Because if enemies being, we_were_reconciled to_ the _\nd god\nd* through the death of_the son of_him, by_much more having_been_reconciled, we_will_be_being_saved by the life of_him.
\v 11 Not and only \add this\add*, but also boasting in the \nd god\nd*, through the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*, through whom now the reconciliation we_received.
\v 12 Because_of this, as by one man the sin into the world came_in, and by the sin the death, also thus to all people the death passed_through, because/for that all sinned, 
\v 13 for/because until \add the\add*_law, sin was in world, but sin not is_being_imputed, not being \add the\add*_law.
\v 14 But reigned the death from Adam/(ʼĀdām) until Mōsaʸs/(Mosheh), even over the \add ones\add* not having_sinned in the likeness of_the transgression of_Adam, who is \add a\add*_pattern of_the \add one\add* coming.
\v 15 But not like the transgression, thus also \add is\add* the gift. For/Because if by_the of_the one \add man\add* transgression, the many died_off, by_much more the grace of_ the _\nd god\nd* and the gift in grace, which \add is\add* of_the one man, \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd*, to the many been_plentiful.
\v 16 And not as by one \add man\add* having_sinned, the gift, the for on_one_hand judgement of one \add transgression\add*, to condemnation, on_the_other_hand the \add the\add*_gift of many transgressions, to just_act.
\v 17 For/Because if by_the of_the one \add man\add* transgression, the death reigned by the one \add man\add*, by_much more the \add ones\add* the abundance the of_grace and of_the gift of_ the _righteousness receiving, in life will_be_reigning, by the one \add man\add*, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*.
\v 18 Therefore consequently as by one transgression, to all people to condemnation, thus also by one just_act, to all people for justification of_life.
\v 19 For/Because as by the one disobedience of_the man, sinners were_appointed the many, thus also by the obedience of_the one \add man\add*, righteous will_be_being_appointed the many.
\v 20 And \add the\add*_law slipped_in, in_order_that may_be_plentiful the transgression, but where been_plentiful the sin, overflowed the grace,
\v 21 in_order_that as reigned the sin in the death, thus also the grace may_reign through righteousness, to life eternal through \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd* the \nd master\nd* of_us.
\c 6
\nb
\v 1 Therefore what we_will_be_saying? We_may_be_continuing_on the in_sin, in_order_that the grace may_be_plentiful?
\v 2 Never it_might_become. Who we_died_off to_ the _sin, how still we_will_be_living in it?
\v 3 Or you_all_are_not_knowing, that as_many_as we_were_immersed into \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous\nd*, into the death of_him we_were_immersed?
\v 4 Therefore we_were_buried_with with_him through the immersion into the death, in_order_that as was_raised \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* from dead by the glory of_the father, thus also we in newness of_life may_walk.
\v 5 For/Because if grown_together we_have_become in_the likeness of_the death of_him, but also of_the resurrection we_will_be, 
\v 6 this knowing that the old of_us person was_executed_on_a_stake_with \add him\add*, in_order_that may_be_nullified the body of_ the _sin, that no_longer to_be_serving us the for_sin.
\v 7 For/Because the \add one\add* having_died_off, has_been_justified from the sin.
\v 8 And if we_died_off with \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, we_are_believing that also we_will_be_living_together with_him, 
\v 9 having_known that \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd* having_been_raised from dead, no_longer is_dying_off, death of_him no_longer is_mastering.
\v 10 For/Because what he_died_off, to_ the _sin died_off once_for_all, but what he_is_living, he_is_living to_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 11 Thus also you_all, be_counting yourselves to_be dead on_one_hand to_ the _sin, on_the_other_hand living to_ the _\nd god\nd* in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.

\v 7 Therefore what? What is_seeking_after Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*), this not it_obtained, but the \add the\add*_choice obtained \add it\add*, and the rest were_hardened,
\v 8 as it_has_been_written: Gave to_them the \nd god\nd* \add a\add*_spirit of_stupor: Eyes which not to_be_seeing, and ears which not to_be_hearing, to the today day.
\v 9 And Dawid/(Dāvid) is_saying: Let_be_become the table of_them for \add a\add*_snare, and for \add a\add*_trap, and for \add an\add*_offense, and for \add a\add*_repayment to_them.
\v 10 Let_be_darkened the eyes of_them, which not to_be_seeing, and the back of_them through all \add time\add* bend.
\v 11 Therefore I_am_asking not they_stumbled, in_order_that they_may_fall? Never it_might_become. But in_the of_them transgression, the salvation \add is\add* to_the pagans, in_order that to_make_jealous them.
\v 12 But if the transgression of_them, riches of_\add the\add*_world \add is\add*, and the loss of_them, riches of_\add the\add*_pagans, by_how_much more the fullness of_them?
\v 13 To_you_all but I_am_speaking, the pagans. For/Because as_much_as therefore indeed am I of_\add the\add*_pagans \add an\add*_ambassador, the service of_me I_am_glorifying,
\v 14 if somehow I_may_make_jealous of_me the flesh, and I_may_save some from them.
\v 15 For/Because if the rejection of_them \add is\add* reconciliation of_\add the\add*_world, what \add is\add* the acceptance except not/lest life from \add the\add*_dead?
\v 16 And if the first-fruit \add is\add* holy, also the lump, and if the root \add is\add* holy, also the branches.
\v 17 But if some of_the branches were_broken_off, and you \add a\add*_wild_olive_tree being were_engrafted among them, and \add a\add*_fellow-partaker of_the root of_the fatness of_the olive_tree you_became,
\v 18 not be_boasting over_the branches. But if you_are_boasting, not you the root are_bearing, but the root \add is_bearing\add* you.
\v 19 Therefore you_will_be_saying: ˓Were˒_broken_off branches, in_order_that I may_be_engrafted.
\v 20 Rightly, by_their unbelief they_were_broken_off, but you the by_faith have_stood. Not high be_thinking, but be_fearing.
\v 21 For/Because if the \nd god\nd* from_the according_to nature branches not spared, neither from_you he_will_be_sparing.
\v 22 Therefore see, \add the\add*_kindness and severity of_\nd god\nd*, on on_one_hand the \add ones\add* having_fallen, severity, on_the_other_hand to you, kindness of_\nd god\nd*, if you_may_continue_on in_the kindness, otherwise also you will_be_being_cut_off.
\v 23 And also_those if not they_may_be_continuing_on the in_unbelief, they_will_be_being_engrafted, because/for powerful is the \nd god\nd* again to_engraft them.
\v 24 For/Because if you out_of the according_to nature were_cut_off wild_olive_tree, and contrary_to nature were_engrafted into \add a\add*_cultivated_olive_tree, by_how_much more these, who according_to nature will_be_being_engrafted in_their own olive_tree?
\v 25 For/Because not I_am_wanting you_all to_be_not_knowing, brothers, the mystery this, in_order_that not you_all_may_be in yourselves prudent, that \add a\add*_hardening in part to_ the _Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*) has_become, until of_which the fullness of_the pagans may_come_in,
\v 26 and thus all Israaʸl/(Yisrā\sup ʼēl\sup*) will_be_being_saved, as it_has_been_written: Will_be_coming out_of Siōn/(Tsiyyōn) the \add one\add* rescuing, he_will_be_turning_away ungodliness from Yakōb/(Yaˊₐqoⱱ).
\v 27 And this \add is\add* to_them, the from me covenant: Whenever I_may_take_away the sins of_them.
\v 28 Concerning on_one_hand the good_message, enemies because_of you_all, on_the_other_hand concerning the choice, beloved because_of the fathers.
\v 29 For/Because unregrettable \add are\add* the gifts and the calling of_ the _\nd god\nd*.
\v 30 For/Because as you_all once disbelieved the in_\nd god\nd*, but now you_all_were_shown_mercy by_the of_these disbelief,
\v 31 thus also these now disbelieved which in_your mercy, in_order_that also they now may_be_shown_mercy.
\v 32 For/Because imprisoned the \nd god\nd* the \add ones\add* all in disbelief, in_order_that which to_all he_may_show_mercy.
\v 33 Oh \add the\add*_depth of_riches, both of_wisdom and knowledge of_\nd god\nd*. How unsearchable \add are\add* the judgements of_him, and untraceable the ways of_him.
