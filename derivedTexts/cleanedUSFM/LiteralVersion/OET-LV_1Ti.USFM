\v 1 Paulos, \add an\add*_ambassador of_\nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, according_to \add the\add*_command of_\nd god\nd* \add the\add*_saviour of_us, and \add the\add*_\nd master Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd* the hope of_us,
\v 2 to_Timotheos, genuine child in \add the\add*_faith: grace, mercy, peace from \nd god\nd* \add the\add*_father and \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous\nd* the \nd master\nd* of_us.
\v 3 As I_implored you to_remain in Efesos, going to Makedonia, in_order_that you_may_command to_some not to_be_teaching_differently,
\v 4 nor to_be_giving_heed to_myths and endless genealogies, which are_bringing_about speculations rather than management of_\nd god\nd*, which \add is\add* in faith.
\v 5 And the outcome of_our charge is love out_of \add a\add*_pure heart, and \add a\add*_ good _conscience, and \add an\add*_ unhypocritical _faith,
\v 6 from_which some having_deviated, were_turned_away to useless_talk,
\v 7 wanting to_be law_teachers, not understanding neither what they_are_saying, nor about what_all they_are_confirming.
\v 8 But we_have_known that the law \add is\add* good, if someone may_be_resorting to_it lawfully,
\v 9 having_known this, that for_\add the\add*_righteous \add the\add*_law is_ not _appointing, but for_\add the\add*_lawless and insubordinate, \add the\add*_ungodly and \add the\add*_sinners, unholy and profane, father_killers and mother_killers, murderers,
\v 10 \add the\add*_sexually_immoral, sodomisers, kidnappers, liars, perjurers, and if any other \add thing\add* is_opposing to_the being_sound teaching,
\v 11 according_to the good_message of_the glory of_the blessed \nd god\nd*, which I was_entrusted.
\v 12 I_am_having thankfulness for_the \add one\add* having_strengthened me, \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd* the \nd master\nd* of_us, because he_considered me faithful, having_appointed \add me\add* to service,
\v 13 the earlier being \add a\add*_slanderous, and \add a\add*_persecutor, and \add an\add*_abuser, but I_was_shown_mercy, because not_knowing, I_did \add it\add* in unbelief.
\v 14 And the grace of_the \nd master\nd* of_us, over_been_plentiful with faith and love which in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous\nd*.
\v 15 Trustworthy \add is\add* the saying, and worthy of_all acceptance: that \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous\nd* came into the world to_save sinners, of_whom I am \add the\add*_first.
\v 16 But because_of this I_was_shown_mercy, in_order_that in me first \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd* may_display his all patience, because/for \add a\add*_pattern of_the \add ones\add* going to_be_believing in him, to life eternal.
\v 17 And to_the king of_the ages, \add the\add*_indestructible, invisible, only \nd god\nd*, honour and glory \add be\add*, to the ages of_the ages. Truly. 
\v 18 This the charge I_am_entrusting to_you, child, Timotheos, according_to the prophesies going_before to you, that you_may_be_warring by them the good warfare,
\v 19 holding faith and \add a\add*_good conscience, which some having_pushed_away, concerning their faith they_suffered_shipwreck, 
\v 20 of_whom is Humenaios and Alexandros, whom I_gave_over to_ the _Satan/(Sāţān), in_order_that they_may_be_disciplined not to_be_slandering.

\v 1 Therefore I_am_exhorting, first of_all petitions, prayers, petitions, thanksgivings to_be_being_made, because/for all people,
\v 2 for kings and all who being in prominence, in_order_that we_may_be_going_by \add a\add*_tranquil and quiet living in all devoutness and dignity.
\v 3 This \add is\add* good and acceptable before \nd god\nd* the saviour of_us,
\v 4 who is_wanting all people to_be_saved, and to_come to \add the\add*_knowledge of_\add the\add*_truth.
\v 5 For/Because one \nd god\nd* \add there_is\add*, also one mediator between_\nd god\nd* and humans, \add the\add*_human \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*,
\v 6 the \add one\add* having_given himself \add a\add*_ransom for all, and testimony in_ \add its\add*_own _seasons,
\v 7 to which I was_appointed \add a\add*_proclaimer and \add an\add*_ambassador (I_am_speaking \add the\add*_truth in \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, I_am_ not _lying), \add a\add*_teacher of_\add the\add*_pagans in knowledge and truth.
\v 8 Therefore I_am_wishing the men to_be_praying in every place, lifted_up devout hands apart_from severe_anger and speculation.
\v 9 Likewise women in respectable apparel to_be_adorning themselves with modesty and sobriety, not with braids, and gold, or pearls, or expensive clothing,
\v 10 but what is_befitting to_women professing \add the\add*_god-fearing, through good works.
\v 11 ˓Let˒_ \add a\add*_woman _be_learning in quietness in all submission.
\v 12 But I_am_ not _permitting to_be_teaching by_\add a\add*_women, nor to_be_domineering of_\add a\add*_man, but to_be in quietness.
\v 13 For/Because Adam/(ʼĀdām) was_formed first, thereafter Heua/(Ḩavvāh), 
\v 14 and Adam was_ not _seduced, but the woman having_been_deceived, has_become in transgression.
\v 15 But she_will_be_being_saved through the childbearing, if they_may_remain in faith, and love, and holiness, with sobriety.

\v 1 The saying \add is\add* trustworthy: If anyone is_aspiring to_overseeing, he_is_desiring of_\add a\add*_good work.
\v 2 Therefore it_is_fitting the overseer to_be irreproachable, \add the\add*_husband of_one wife, sober, sensible, respectable, hospitable, teaching,
\v 3 not winebibbing, nor \add a\add*_bully, but gentle, peaceable, ungreedy,
\v 4 leading of_his own house well, having children in submission, with all dignity
\v 5 (but if someone has_ not _known to_lead of_his own house, how ˓will˒_he_be_taking_care of_\add the\add*_assembly of_\nd god\nd*?)
\v 6 Not \add a\add*_neophyte, in_order_that not having_been_conceited, he_may_fall_in into \add the\add*_judgement of_the devil.
\v 7 And it_is_fitting \add him\add* also, to_be_having \add a\add*_ good _testimony from the \add ones\add* outside, in_order_that he_may_ not _fall_in into derision and \add the\add*_snare of_the devil.
\v 8 Servants likewise \add should_be\add* dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to_ much _wine, not greedy,
\v 9 holding the mystery of_the faith in \add a\add*_ clean _conscience.
\v 10 And also let_ these _be_being_approved first, thereafter let_them_be_serving, being unindictable.
\v 11 ˓Their˒_wives likewise \add should_be\add* dignified, not diabolical, sober, faithful in all \add things\add*.
\v 12 Servants, let_ them _be husbands of_one wife, leading of_\add their\add*_children well and of_their own households.
\v 13 For/Because the \add ones\add* having_served well are_procuring \add a\add*_ good _standing for_themselves, and great confidence in \add the\add*_faith which in \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*.
\v 14 I_am_writing these \add things\add* to_you, hoping to_come to you in quickness,
\v 15 but if I_may_be_slowing, in_order_that you_may_have_known how it_is_fitting to_be_being_conducted in \add the\add*_household of_\nd god\nd*, which is \add the\add*_assembly of_\nd god\nd* \add the\add*_living, \add the\add*_pillar and foundation of_the truth.
\v 16 And confessedly great is the of_ the _devoutness mystery: Who was_revealed in \add the\add*_flesh, was_justified in \add the\add*_\nd spirit\nd*, was_seen by_messengers, was_proclaimed among \add the\add*_nations, was_believed in \add the\add*_world, was_taken_up in glory.

\v 1 But the \nd spirit\nd* is_speaking expressly that in later times, some will_be_withdrawing from_the faith, giving_heed to_ deceitful _spirits and teachings of_demons,
\v 2 in hypocrisy of_liars, having_been_seared their own conscience,
\v 3 forbidding to_be_marrying, to_be_keeping_away from_foods that the \nd god\nd* created for partaking with thanksgiving by_the faithful \add ones\add* and having_known the truth.
\v 4 Because every creature of_\nd god\nd* \add is\add* good, and nothing being_received with thanksgiving \add is\add* rejected,
\v 5 for/because it_is_being_sanctified by \add the\add*_message of_\nd god\nd* and petition.
\v 6 These \add things\add* laying_down to_the brothers, you_will_be \add a\add*_ good _servant of_\nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, being_nourished in_the messages of_the faith, and of_the good teaching with_which you_have_followed.
\v 7 But be_refusing the profane and granny myths. And be_training yourself to devoutness, 
\v 8 For/Because the bodily training for is \add a\add*_little beneficial, but the devoutness is beneficial for all \add things\add*, \add the\add*_promise holding of_\add the\add*_ which present _life, and of_the_ coming _\add life\add*.
\v 9 The saying \add is\add* trustworthy, and worthy of_all acceptance.
\v 10 For/Because we_are_labouring and we_are_striving for this, because we_have_hoped in \add a\add*_ living _\nd god\nd*, who is \add the\add*_saviour of_all people, most_of_all of_believers.
\v 11 Be_commanding these \add things\add* and be_teaching.
\v 12 let_ no_one of_you _be_Despising the youth, but be_becoming \add an\add*_example for_the believing \add ones\add*, in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.
\v 13 Until I_am_coming, be_giving_heed to_the public_reading, to_ the _exhortation, to_ the _teaching.
\v 14 Not be_neglecting of_the gift in you, which was_given to_you through prophecy, with \add the\add*_laying_on of_the hands of_the council_of_elders.
\v 15 Be_pondering these \add things\add*, be in these \add things\add*, in_order_that the progress of_you may_be manifest to_all.
\v 16 Be_holding_on to_yourself and to_the teaching. Be_continuing_on in_them, because/for doing this, you_will_be_saving both yourself and the \add ones\add* hearing from_you.

\v 1 You_may_ not _harshly_give_rebuke to_\add an\add*_elder, but be_exhorting \add him\add* as \add a\add*_father, younger \add men\add* as brothers,
\v 2 eldresses as mothers, younger as sisters, in all purity.
\v 3 Be_honouring widows, who \add are\add* really widows.
\v 4 But if any widow is_having children or grandchildren, let_them_be_learning to_be_devout first to_their own household, and to_be_giving_back recompense to_the parents, because/for this is acceptable before the \nd god\nd*.
\v 5 And the \add woman\add* really \add a\add*_widow and having_been_isolated has_hoped in \nd god\nd*, and is_remaining the in_petitions and the prayers, night and day.
\v 6 But the \add woman\add* living_luxuriously, while_living has_died.
\v 7 Also be_commanding these \add things\add*, in_order_that they_may_be irreproachable.
\v 8 But if anyone is_ not _providing of_their own and most_of_all household, he_has_disowned the faith, and is worse \add than\add* \add an\add*_unbeliever.
\v 9 ˓Let˒_ \add a\add*_widow _be_being_enrolled having_become not lessor \add than\add* sixty years, \add the\add*_wife of_one husband,
\v 10 being_attested in good works: if she_raised_children, if she_lodged_strangers, if she_washed \add the\add*_feet of_holy \add ones\add*, if she_assisted being_oppressed \add ones\add*, if she_followed_after to_every work good.
\v 11 But be_refusing younger widows, because/for whenever they_may_become_sensual against_the \nd chosen_one/messiah\nd*, they_are_willing to_be_marrying,
\v 12 having judgement because they_rejecting their first faith.
\v 13 But also together they_are_learning \add to_be\add* idle, going_around the houses, and not only idle, but also gossips and meddling, speaking the \add things\add* not fitting.
\v 14 Therefore I_am_wishing \add the\add*_younger \add women\add* to_be_marrying, to_be_bearing_children, to_be_keeping_house, not_one opportunity to_be_giving of_insult to_the \add one\add* opposing for_reason_of.
\v 15 For/Because already some were_turned_away after the Satan/(Sāţān).
\v 16 If any believing \add woman\add* is_having widows, he _let_be_assisting to_them, and not let_be_being_weighed_down the assembly, in_order_that it_may_assist to_the really widows.
\v 17 The elders having_led well, let_be_being_considered_worthy of_double honour, most_of_all the \add ones\add* labouring in \add the\add*_message and \add the\add*_teaching.
\v 18 For/Because the scripture is_saying: Not you_will_be_muzzling \add an\add*_ox threshing, and: Worthy \add is\add* the worker of_the wage of_him.
\v 19 Be_ not _accepting accusation against \add an\add*_elder, besides except not/lest on two or three witnesses.
\v 20 Be_rebuking before all the \add ones\add* sinning, in_order_that also the rest may_be_having fear.
\v 21 I_am_testifying before the \nd god\nd*, and \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, and the chosen messengers, in_order_that you_may_keep these \add things\add* apart_from prejudice, doing nothing according_to partiality.
\v 22 Be_laying_on hands quickly on_no_one, nor be_sharing in_\add the\add*_ anothers _sins, be_keeping yourself pure.
\v 23 No_longer be_drinking_water \add only\add*, but be_giving_treatment with_ \add a\add*_little _wine, because_of your stomach and the frequent sicknesses of_you.
\v 24 The sins of_some people are quite_evident, going_before \add them\add* to judgement, but to_some also they_are_following_after.
\v 25 Likewise also the the good works \add are\add* quite_evident, and the \add ones\add* being otherwise, are_ not _being_able to_be_hidden.

\v 1 As_many_as slaves are under \add a\add*_yoke, let_them_be_considering their own masters worthy of_all honour, in_order_that the name of_ the _\nd god\nd* and the teaching may_ not _be_being_slandered.
\v 2 And the_ believing _\add ones\add* having masters, them_let_ not _be_despising, because they_are brothers, but rather them _let_be_serving, because they_are believing and beloved, who \add are\add* benefitting from_their good_work. Be_teaching these \add things\add* and be_exhorting.
\v 3 If anyone is_teaching_differently, and is_ not _approaching to_being_sound in_\add the\add*_messages, which of_the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa) chosen_one/messiah\nd*, and in_the teaching according_to devoutness,
\v 4 he_has_been_conceited knowing nothing, but obsessing about debates and quibbles_about_messages, out_of which is_becoming envy, strife, slander, evil suspicions,
\v 5 constant_frictions, of_people the mind having_been_ruined and having_been_defrauded of_the truth, thinking the devoutness to_be \add a\add*_means_of_gain.
\v 6 But the devoutness with contentment it_is \add a\add*_means_of_gain great.
\v 7 For/Because we_carried_in nothing into the world, because neither we_are_being_able to_bring_out anything.
\v 8 And having sustenance and shelters, with_these we_will_be_being_sufficed.
\v 9 But the \add ones\add* wishing to_be_being_rich, are_falling_in into temptation, and \add a\add*_snare, and many foolish and harmful desires, which are_sinking the people into destruction and destruction.
\v 10 For/Because \add a\add*_root of_all the evil is the fondness_of_silver, of_which some aspiring, have_wandered_away from the faith, and pierced themselves with_ many _sorrows.
\v 11 But you, Oh person of_\nd god\nd*, be_fleeing these \add things\add*, but be_pursuing righteousness, devoutness, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.
\v 12 Be_fighting the good fight of_the faith, take_hold of_the eternal life, to which you_were_called and you_confessed the good confession before many witnesses.
\v 13 I_am_commanding to_you before the \nd god\nd*, the \add one\add* giving_life_to the_ all _\add things\add*, and \nd chosen_one/messiah Yaʸsous/(Yəhōshūˊa)\nd*, the \add one\add* having_testified the good confession before Pontios Pilatos,
\v 14 you to_keep the command spotless irreproachable, until the appearing of_the \nd master\nd* of_us, \nd Yaʸsous chosen_one/messiah\nd*,
\v 15 which in_ \add his\add*_own _seasons the blessed and only Sovereign will_be_showing, the king of_the \add ones\add* reigning, and \add the\add*_\nd master\nd* of_the \add ones\add* mastering,
\v 16 who alone having immortality, dwelling in_light unapproachable, whom not_one of_\add the\add*_people saw, nor is_able to_see, to_whom \add be\add* honour and eternal dominion. Truly. 
\v 17 To_the rich in the present age, be_commanding not to_be_highfaluting, nor to_have_hoped in \add the\add*_uncertainty of_riches, but in \nd god\nd*, which bringing_about us all \add things\add* richly for enjoyment,
\v 18 to_be_working_good, to_be_being_rich in good works, to_be well_imparting, generous,
\v 19 storing_away for_themselves \add a\add*_ good _foundation for the_ coming _\add time\add*, in_order_that they_may_take_hold of_the really life.
\v 20 Oh Timotheos, guard the deposit, turning_away the profane empty_babblings and oppositions of_the falsely_called knowledge,
\v 21 which some professing concerning the faith deviated. The grace \add be\add* with you_all.
