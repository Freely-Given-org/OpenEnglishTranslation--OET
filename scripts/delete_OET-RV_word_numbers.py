Script to delete word numbers out of the OET-RV NT.
    This is usually run if the number of rows in the SR collation table has changed,
        i.e., all of the SR word numbers have moved.

Of course, it will lose any word numbers that have been manually added
    rather than by a script that can reinsert them.

TODO: A better alternative might be one that can add an offset to any word number
        that's above a certain word number.

        
CHANGELOG:
    2025-03-07 Added OT processing
